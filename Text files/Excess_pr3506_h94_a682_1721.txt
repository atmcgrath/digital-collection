But the impatient A L o v i s a diSdaining to be rank'd with thofe, whom her Vanity made her constder as infinitely her Inferio:s, Suffer’d her Self to be agitated almost to Madnefs between the two Extreams of Love and Indignation ; a thouSand Chhneras came into her Head, and shme-times prompted her to difcover the Sentiments she had in his favour : But theSe Resolutions were rejeded, almost as Soon as form’d, and she could hot fix on any for a long time ; till at last, Love (ingenious in Invention,) infpir’d her with one, which probably might let her into the Secrets of his Heart, without the shame of revealing her own.

Nor did he find any thin^ sh pleafing in that Thought as might make him endeavour to re« pell it; the more he conlider’d his own Perfections, the more he was confirm'd in his belief, but who to fix it on, he was at a lost as much as ever; he then began to rested: on all the Distourfes and little Railleries that had past’d between him and the Ladies whom he had convers’d with fince his Arri-valibut cou’d find nothing in any oS ’em of Confe-quence enough to make him guest at the Pershn. He Spent great part of the Night in Thoughts very different from thofe he was accustom’d to, the Joy which naturally rifes from the Knowledge his in ones pow’r to give it, gave him Notions which till then he was a Stranger to ; he began to con-fider a Mistrefs as an agreeable^ as well as fashionable amustment, and refolv’d not to be Cruel.

I fat down at the Foot of a DIANA, curioLissy carv’d in Marble, and full of melancholly Reflexions without knowing what I did, took a black lead Pen out of my Pocket, and writ on the Pedestal theSe two Lines.

Thefe Words might have born two Interpretations, if the dif-dainful Air with which I Spoke ’em, and which I could not diffemble, and going immediately away had not made him take ’em as they were really delign’d, to affront him, He was full of Indignation and Jealoufy (if it is poffible for a Per Son to be touch’d with that Passion, who is not capable of the other, which generally occassons it) but however, having taken it into his Head to imagine I was better receiv’d by Ansellina than he dessred ; Envy, and a fort of Womanish Spleen transported him fo far as to go to An sell ina’s Apartment, and rail at me most profufely (as I have ssnce been told) and threaten how much he’d be reveng’d, ifheheardi ever should have the

She Seem’d Surpriz’d at Seeing me So early, and with her wonted good Humour, askfng nie the reafon of it, put me into a mortal Agoiiy how to anfwer her, for I must affstre you Brother, that the fears oS her Difpleafure were a thoufand times more dreadful to me, than any other apprehenfions ; she repeated the (Question three or four times before I had Courage to Repl3r, and I believe she was pretty near guessing the Truth by my Silence, and the diforder in my Countenance before I Spoke ; and when I did, she receiv’d the account of the whole Adventure with a vast deal of trouble, but no anger; she knew too well what I ow’d to my Reputation, and the Post his Majesty had honour’d me with, to believe, I cou’d, or ought to difpence with Submitting to the Reflections which must have fallen on me, had I a£ted otherwife than I did. H^r Concern and Tears, which she had not Power to contaiixrat the thoughts of my Depar-ture, joyri d: with her earnest Conjurations To me to be gone, let me more than ever into the Secrets of her Heart, and gave me a Pleafijre as incon* ceiyeable as the necessity of parting did the contrary. Nothing cou’d be more moving than our, taking leave, and when she tore her Self half willing and half unv/illing froin my Arms, had Sent

Thus Brother, have I given you, in as few Words as I con’d, a Recital of every thing that has hapen’d to me of Confe-quence lince our Separation, which I dare believe you will find more to Pity than Condemn. The afflidSed CheValier cou’d not conclude Without letting fall Some Tears; which the CoWiit perceive-ing, ran to him, aiid tenderly embracing him, laid all that coffd be eipedted from a most astedtio-^ nate Friend to mitigate his Sorrows,nor Suffered him to remove from his Arms Till he had acoshplifli’d his Delign ; and then believing the hearing of the Adventures of another, (especially one he was sh deeply interested in) would be the Surest means to give a Truce to the more melancholy Refiedtions on his own, relating every thing that had befallen him fince his coming to Paris. The Letters he receiv’d from a Lady hicognito, his little Gallantries v/ith a Amen A, and the accident that preSented to his view, the unknown Lady in the Pershn of one of the greatest Fortunes in all France. Nothing cou’d be a greater Cordial to the Chevalier, tbah to find his Brother was belov’d by the Sister of Ansellina, he did not doubt but that by this means there might be a polfibility of feeing her Sooner than elSe he cou’d have hop’d, and the two Brothers began to enter into a Serious consultation of this Affair, which ended with a Resolution to fix their Fortunes there. The Count had neveryet Seen a Beauty formidable enough to give, him an Hours unealineSs (purely for the fake of Love) and would often Say^ Gipiffs Quiver never

held an Arrow oS force to reach his Heart; thofe little Delicacies, thole trembling aking Tranf* porte, which every fight of the belov’d Object oC» cafions, and fb vifibly distinguillies a real Paf-fion from a Counterfeit, he look’d on as the Chimera’s of an idle Brain, form’d to infpire Notions oS an imaginary Blifs, and make Fools lofe themfelves in Seeking ; or if they had a Bein_ it was only in weak Souls, a kind of a DifeaSe with which he afiur’d himfelf he should never be infefted. Ambition was certainly the reigningPaf-fion in his Soul, and Alovisa’s Quality and vast Poffeffions, promifing a full Gratification of that, he ne’er So much as wish’d to know a farther Hap-pinefs in Marriage.
But while the Count and Chevalier were thus Employ’d, the Rival Ladies past the Hours in a very different Entertainment, the diSpair^and bitter Lamentations that the unfortunate Amen a made, when fire came out of her fwocning, were shch as mov’d even Alovisa to Compallion, and if any thing but refigning D’elmont coud have given her Conshlation, she wou’d willing have apply’d it. There was now no need of further Diffimula-tion, and she confeffed to Amen A, that she had Lov’d the Charming Count with a kind of Madiiefs from the first Moment she beheld him
th
That to favour her Defigns on him, she had made Tife of every Stratagem she con'd invent, that by her means, the Armour was first difcover’dto Mo7i-Jienr Sanseverin, and his Family Alarm’d i Nig'.t before; and Lastly, that her Per-fuafions,hehad reSolv’d to fend her to a Monastry, to which she must prepare her Self to go in a few Days without taking any leave even of her Father; have you (cry’d Amena hastily interrupting.her)

have you prevail’d with my Father to fend me from this hated Place without the Punishment of hearing his uphraidings ? Which the other an-Iwering in the Affirmative, I thank you, reshm’d AmeNa, that Favour has cancell’d all your shore of Cruelty, for after the Follies I have been guilty of, nothing is sh dreadful as the Sight of him, and who wou’d, oh Heavens I fcontinu’d she bursting into a Flood of Tears) wish’d to stay in a World sh full of Falshood. She was able to utter no more for fome Moments, but at last, railing hershlf on the Bed where she was laid, and endeavouring to feem a little more compos’d : I have two Favours, Madam, yet to ask of yen (rejoyn’d she) neither of ’em will I believe shem difficult to you to grant, that you will make ush of the Power you have with my Father, to let my departure he as fudden as polfible, and that while I am here, 1 may never she Cowwt D’elmont. It was not likely that Alov ISA shou'd deny Requests fo fuitabie to her own Inclinations,and believing,with a great deal of Reafon that her Preshnee was not very greatful,left her to the Care of her Women,whom Ihe order’d to attend her with the shme Diligence, as hershlf. It was Evening before the Count came, arid Alov ISA Spent the remainder of the Day in v'ery uneafy Refledions, she knew not as yet,whether she had caush to rejoyce in, or blame her Fortune in sh unexpededly difeoveringherPaffion, and an inceffant Yirilfitude of Hope and Fears, rack’d her with most intollerable Inquietude, ’till the darling Objed of her Wishes appear'd, and tho’ the first fight of him, added to her other Paf-fions, that of Shame, yet he manag’d his Addrefs fb well, and fo modestly and artfully hinted the

He shon put it in her Power to oblige him, by giving her the History of his Brother’s Paffion for her Sister,and she was not at all backward in affuring him how much she approv’d of it, and that she wou’d write to Ansel-LiNA by the first Post, to engage her coming to Paris with all imaginable fpeeci. In fine, there was nothing she cou’d ask refus’d, and indeed it would have been ridiculous for her to have affedted Coynefs, after the Testimonies she had long fince given him of one of the most violent Passions that ever was; this fore-knowledge Sav’d abundance of Diffimulation on both Sides, and she took care that if he should be wanting in his kind Expressions after Marriage, he should not have it in his Power to pretend (as shine Husbands have donej

Every thing was prefently agreed upon,and the Wedding-Day appointed, which was to be as shon aS every thing cou’d be got ready to make it Magnificent ^ tho’ the Coitnfs good Nature made him defirous to learn Something of Amen a, yet he durst not enquire for fear of giving an Umbrage to his intended Bride • but she, imagining the reafon of his Silence, very frankly told him, how she v/as to be diSpos’d of, this knowledge made no finall Addition to his Contentment, for had she stay’d in Farts., he cou’d expert nothing but continual Jealoufies from Alovisa ;bessdes as he really wish’d her happy, tho’ he cou’d not make her So, he thought Abfenee might banish a hopelefs PalSion from her Heart, and time and

He stay’d at Alovisa’s Honfe ’till it was pretty late, and perhaps they had not parted in Some Hours longer, if his impatience to inform his Brother his fucceSs, had not carried him away. The young Chevalier was infinitely more Transported at the bear Hopes of being Something nearer the aim of allhis Wishes, then D’elmont was at the affstrance of loofing his, and cou’d not forbear rallying him for pla-t cing the ultimate of his Wishes on fiich a Toy, as he argu’d Woman was, which the Chevalier endeavouring to confute, there began a very warm Dispute, in which neither of ’em being able to. convince the other, steep at last interpos’d as Moderator. The next Day they w’^ent together to vifit Alov I sa, and from that time were Seldom afun-der : Butin compassion to Amena, they tool what Care they cou’d to conceal the Defign they had in Hand, and that unhappy Lady was in a few Days, according to her Rivals Contrivance, hurried away without feeing any of her Friends. When she was gone,and there was no further need of keeping it a Secret, the News of this great Wedding was immediatel)?- Spread over the whole Town, and every one talk’d of it, as their particular Interests or Affedtions dilated. All D’el-mont’s Friends were full of Joy, and he met no inconfiderable Augmentation of it himfelf, when his Brother receiv’d a Letter from Ansellina,
with an Account that Bel pine’s Wound was

found not dangercus, and that he was in a very fair way of Recovery. And it was concluded that as fijon as the Wedding was over, the young Che-valierihould go in PerSon to Amiens, to fetch his belov’d Ansellina, in order for a Second, and

My dear Charge, (Said he taking him by the Hand and i)ref-ling it to his trembling Bofom) you See me at the point of Death, but the knowledge of your many Virtues,and the Confidence I have that you will not deny me the request I am about to ask, makes me Support the thoughts of it with Moderation. The' other alluring him of his readinefs to ferve him in any Command, encourag’d the old Gentleman to profecute his DifcourSe in this manner : You are not Ignorant my Lord (Rejoin’d He) that my Son (the only one I have) is on his Travels, gone by my Approbation, and his own Defires to make th^ Tour of Europe *, but I have a Daughter, whofe Protedlion I wou’d entreat you to undertake 5 her Education in a Monastery has hitherto kept her intirely unacquainted with the Gayeties of a Court, or the Conversation of the Beau Monde^ and I have Sent for her to Parh purpoSely to Introduce her j.n$o Company, proper for a young

D’elmont anfwer’d this Request, with repeated affurances of fulfilling it, and frankly offer’d, if he had no other Pershn in whom he rather woii’d confide, to take the management of the whole Estate he left behind him, ’till young Frankville ffiould return—The anxious Father was transported at this Favour, and thank’d him in Terms full of Gratitude and Affedfion ; the}^ Spent shine Hours in shttling this Affair, and perhaps had not ended it sh shon, if word had not been brought that the young Lady his Daughter was allighted at the Gate *, ’tis impolTible to exprefs the Joy which fill’d the old Gentleman’s Heart at this News,and he began afresh to put the Count in mind of what he had promis’d concerning her: As they were in this endearing, tho’ mournful Entertainment, the matchleSs Melliora enter’d, the Surprize and Grief for her Father’s Indifpofition fha-ving heard of it but lince she came into the Hoiish) hindred her from regarding any thing but him, and throwing herfelf on her knees by the Bed-lide, wash’d the Hand which he stretch’d out to raife her with, in a flood of Tears, accompany’d with Expreffions, which unstudy’d, and incoherent as they were, had a delicacy in ’em, that show’d her Wit not inferiour to her Tendernefs, and that no

When they came to his Houfe, He prefent* ed her to A l o v y s A, and giving her a brief Account of what had hap;^ened, ^ engag’d that Lady to receive her with all immaginable Demonstrations of Civility and Kindnefs.

How often didT^ Curfe the Hour in which Al ovysa’s fondnefs was Difcover’d ? and how much more, his own Ambition which prompted him to take advantage of it ? and hurry’d him Precipitalty to a Hymen, where Love, (the noblest Guest) was wanting. It was in thefe racks of Thought^ that the unfortunate A M E N A was remember’d, and he cou’d not forbear acknowledging the Justice of that Doom, whieh Instided on him, thefe very Torments he had given her. A Severe Repentance feiz’d on his Soul, and A l o v y s a for whom he never had any thing more than an Indifferency ; now began to feem Distastful to his Fancy, he look’d •on her, as indeed she was, the chief Author of Amen a’s Misfortunes, and abhorr'd her for that Infidelity, But when he confider’d her, as the Bar ’twixt Him and Melliora she appear’d like_^ his ill Genius to him, and he cou’d not fiipport the Thoughts of being obliged to Love her (or at least to feem as if he did) with Moderation. In the midst of thefe Reste£lions, his Servant came in and deliver’d this Letter to him which had been just left by the Post. The Count immediately knew the Hand to be Amena’s, and was cover’d with the utmost Confufion and Remorfe when he read thefe Lines.

The Count was not at prefent in a Humour to relish this Merriment, he was too ferioufly in Love to bear that any thing relating to it shou’d be turn’d into Ridicule, and was far from repenting he had done no more, fince what he had done, had occalion’d her difpleaSijre: But fhe Baron.^ who had destgns in his Head, which he knew cou’d not by any means be brought to Succeed, but by keeping the Count’s Passion warm, made ufe

What is it that a Lover cannot Accomplish when Resolution is on his fide ? D’elmont after having form’d a Thoufand fruitlefs Inventions, at last pitch’d on one, which promis’d him, an Alfiirance of Succefs : In M e l L i o R a’s Chamber there was a little Door that open’d to a pair of Back Stairs, for the Convenience of the Servants coming to clean the Room, and at the Bottom of that Difcent, a Gate into the Garden. The Count Set his Wits to Work to get the Keys of thoSe two Doors, that of the Garden stood always in it, nor coil’d he keep it, without it’s being mist at Night, when they shou’d come to fasten the Gate, therefore, he carefully took the Impreffion in Wax, and had one made ex-adtly like it: The other he cou’d by no means Compafs without making fbme Excufe to go to Mellicra’s Chamber, and she had delir’d that none might vifit her: But he overcome this Bar to his Defign at Last ; there was a Cabinet in it, where he told Alovysa he had put shine Papers of great Concern which now he wanted to look over, and defir’d she wou’d make an A-pology for his coming in, to fetch them. Mell i-oRA imagiiSd this was only a Pretence to fee her, but his WfiSe being with him, and he faying nothing to her, or taking any farther notice, than what Common Civility requir’d, was not much troubled at it.

He took an inexpressible Pleasure, in gazing on her as she lay, and in this filent Contemplation of her Thoufand Charms, his mind was Agitated with various Emotions, and the refistieSs posture he beheld her in, rouz’d all that was Honourable in him, he thought it pity even to wake her, but more to wrong shch Innocence, and he was Sometimes Prompted to return and leave her as he found her.
But whatever Dominion, Honour, and Virtue may have over our waking Thoughts, ’tis certain that they fly from the clos’d Eyes, our Paffions then exert their forceful Power, and that which is most Predominant in the Soul, Agitates the fancy, and brings even Things ImpolSible to pals : Delire, with watchful Diligence repell’d, returns with greater violence in unguarded steep, and overthrows the vain Efforts of Day.

He found Count Dtlmont full of troubled and perr plexed Thoughts, and when he had heard the History of his Difappointment : I am lorry to hear (Said he) that the foolish Girl does not know her own mind-----

Tho’ nothing Palls dcfire fo much as too eafie Stn Afliirance of means to gratifie it, yet a little hope is ahfblutely neceffary to preferve it, The fiery Willies of D’elmont's Soul, beSore, Chiird by difpair, and half fiipprest with Clouding Griefs, Blaz’d now, as Fierce, and Vigorous as ever, and he found fo much prbbabb lity in what the Baron faid, that he was rea» dy to Adore him for the Contrivance.


Thus all Parties but Melhora remain’d in a fort of a pleas’d Expectation. The Count doubted not of being happy, nor Alovysa of having her Curiofity Satisfy’d by the Baroih Assistance, nor himSelf of the reward he de-fign'd to demand of her for that good Service, and each long’d Impatiently for the Day, or rather flight, which was to bring this great Affair to a Period. PoorMELtiORA was the only Per-ion, who had no Interval of Comfort. Restrain’d by Honour, and enfiam’d by Love, her very Soul was torn : And when she found that Count D’elmont made no attempt to get into her Chamber again, as she imagin’d he wou’d, she fell into a Difpair more terrible than all her former Inquietudes, she prefently fancy’d that the Disappointment he had met with, the Kight before, had driven the hopelefs Passion from his Heart, and the Thoughts of being no longer Beloved by him were unfupportable. She Saw him not all that Day, nor the next, the quarrel between him and Alovysa having caus'd Separate Tables, she was oblig’d in Decency, to eat at that where she was, and had

I N the mean time the Baron Diligent to make good the Promifes he had given the Count and Alovysa, for his own Ends, 'got every thing ready, and came himfelf to D’elmont’s Houfe, to entreat their Company at his. Now Madam (Said he) to Alovysa the time is come to prove your Servants Faith : This Night shall put an end to your uncertainty : They had no opportunity for further Speech, Melliora came that Moment into the Room, who being ask’d to go to the Ball, and Seeming a little unwilling to appear at any Publick Diverfion by Reafbn of the late Death of her Father, put the Baron in a Mortal Apprehenfion for the Siic-ceSs of his Undertaking : But Alovysa joyn** ing in his Entreaties she was at last prevail’d
upon
Baron
in his Chariot: And the Lady shon follow’d in an other.
There was a vast deal of Company there,’ and the Count danc’d with Several of the Ladies, and was Extreamly gay amonst them : Alovysa watch’d his Behaviour, and regarded every one of them, in their Turn, with Jealoufie, but was far from having the least Sufpicion of her whom only she had CauSe.
Tho’ Mell iora’s greatest Motive to go was, becauSe she might have the happineSs of feeing

This kind of Behaviour Ba* nish’d, part of her Sufferings, for tho’ Ihe cou’d Constder both his, and her own PalSion in ilo other view , than that of a very great Misfortune to them both, yet there are So many Pieashres even in the Pains of Love : Such tender Thrillings, fuch Soul-Ravishing AmuSe-

When it grew pretty late, the Barok made a stgn to the Count to follow him into a little Room joyning to that where- they were, and when he had ; now my Lord (Said he) I doubt not but this Night will make you entirely poS-feffbr of your Wishes : I have prolong’d the Entertainment on purpofe to detain thoSe who ’tis necefiary for our Destgn, and have or* der’d a Chamber for Melliora which has no Impediment to Bar your Entrance; O !

As he was fpeaking, Melan-Tha who had taken notice of his going out of the Room, and had follow’d him with a deligil of talking to him, came time enough to hear the latter part of what he laid, but feeing her Bro* ther with him withdrew with as much hast as she came, and Infinitely more uneastnefs of Mind, she was now but too well aflur’d that she had a greater Difficulty than the Count’s Matrimonial Engagement to get over, before She cou’d reach his Heart, and was ready to burst with Vexation to think she was Supplanted : Full of a Thoiifand Tormenting Refledions she return’d to the Ball Room, and was So out of Humour all the Night that she cou’d hardly be Comraoix^ ly Civil to any Body that fpoke to her.
At last the hour So much destr’d by the Count, the Baron., and Alovysa (tho’ for various Reafons) was arriv’d : The Company broke up,

THA and defir’d she vimu’d tahe care of the Ladies as he shou’d Diredt, but above all charg’d to place Alovysa and Melliora iii two Chambers which he show’d her.
Melantha was now let into the fecret Ihe So much defir’d to know, the Name of her Ri-val, which she had not come time enough to hear, when she did the Count’s Rapturous De-fcription of her.^ She had before found out, that her Brother was in Love with Alovysa, and did not doubt but that there was a double Intrigue to be carry’d on that Night, and was the more Confirm’d in that Opinion , when Ihe remembred that the Baron had order'd the Lode that day to be taken off the Door of that Chamber where Melliora was to be Lodg’d. It prefently came into her Head, to betray all she knew to Alovysa, but she Soon rejested that Resolution for another, which she thought wou’d give her a more pleafing Revenge : She Conduced all the Ladies to Such Chambers as she thought fit, and Alovysa to that her Brother had defir’d, having no defign of Disappointing him, but Melliora she led to one where she always lay her Self, roSolving to Supply her place in the other, where the Count was to come : Yes (Said she to her Self) I will receive his Vows in Melliora’s Room, and when I find him rais’d to the highest Pitch of Espestation, declare who I am, and Awe him

When the Baron found every thing was li-lent, and ready for his purpofe, he went fbfrly to Count D’elmont’s Chamber, where he was impatiently Expected, and talcing him by the Hand, led him to that, where he had ordered Mel licr a to be Lodg’d, when they were at the Door, you fee my Lord (faid he) I have kept my Promife : There lies the Idol of your Soul, go in, be bold, and all the Happinefs you wish attend you. The Count was in too great a hurry of diterder’d Thoughts to make him any other anfwer than a Passionate Embrace, and gently pushing open the Door, which had no fastning to it, left the Baron to Profecute the remaining part of his Treacherous Design.
Alovysa had all the time of her being at the Barons , Endur’d most grievous Racks of Mind, her Husband appear’d to her, that Night, more Gay, and more Lovely if poffible than ever, but that Contentment which fat upon his Face, and added to his Graces, stung her to the Soul, when she Reflected how little Simpathy their was between them,Scarce a Mruth

Tho’she Count had been but a very little time in the Arms of his fuppos’d Mel l loR a, yet he had made So good ufe of it, and had taken fb much Advantage of her complying Humour, that all his Fears were at an End, he now thought him-Self the most Fortunate of all Mankind and Me-LANTHA was far from repenting the Breach of the Resolution she had made of Distovering her-felf to him. His Behaviour to her was all Rapture, all killing Extacy, and she flatter’d her-felf with a Eeleif, that when he shou’d come to know to whom he ow’d that Blifs he had pofleSs’d, he would not be ungrateful for it.

Help! or the Barbarous Man will kill me 1 At thele Words the Baron came running in immediately, full of Surprize and Rage at Something he had met with in the mean time : How came this Woman here, cry’d the Count to him : Ask me not my Lord (faid he) for I can anfwer nothing, but every thing this Curled Night, I think, has happened by Enchantment •, he was going to fay fomething more, but Several of his Guests hearing a Noile, and cry of Murder, and diredled by the Lights they Saw in that Room, came in, and prefently after a great many of the Servants, that the Chamber was as full as it con’d hold: The Count let go his Wife on the Sight of the first Stranger that Enter’d; and indeed, there was no need of his Confining her in that Place (tho’ he knew not fo much) for the violence of So many contrary Paffions warring in her, Breast at once, had thrown her into a Swoon, and she fell back when he let go his Hold of her, Motionlest, and in all appearance Dead. The Count laid little, but began to put on his Cloaths, asham’d of the Posture he had been feen in; but the Baron endeavour’d to perSwade the Company, that it was only a Family Quarrel of no ConSequence, told them he was shrry for the Disturbance it had given them, and delir’d them to return to their Rest, and when the Room was pretty clear, order d two or three of the Maids to carry A L o-VY s A to her Chamber, and apply Things proper for her Recovery ; as they were bearing her out, Mel L10R A who had been frighted as well as the

The Count was going to the Bed-stde to comfort the conceal’d Fair, that lay still under the Cloaths, when he Saw Melliora at the Door: What Surprize was ever equal to his, at this View?
He stood like one transfix’d with Thunder^ he knew not what to think, or rather cou’d not think at all. Confounded with a Seeming ImpolSi-bility. He beheld the Pershn, whom he thought had lain in his Arms, whom he had enjoy’d, whole Bulk and Proportion he still faw in the Bed, whom he was just going to Addrefs to, and for whom he had been in all the Agonies of Soul imaginable, come from a distant Chamber^ and miconcern’d, askcoolyhow AloVysa came to be taken ill: He look’d confufedly about.

The Baron cou’d not prefently reSolve after what manner he shou’d anfwer, tho’ he perfectly knew the Truth of this Adventure, and who was in the Bed ; for, when hehad Condu(sted AloVYsa to that Room, in order to make the DiScovery he had promis’d, he went to his Sister's Chamber, defigning to abScond there, in cafe the Count shou’d fly out on his Wife’s Entrance, and feeing him there, imagine who it was that betray’d him; and finding the Door shut, knock’d and call’d to

As for his Wife he thought not of her, with any Compaffion for his Sufferings, but with Rage and Hate, for that jealous Curiofity, which he Suppos’d had led her to watch his Aftions thatNight, (for he had not the least fufpicion of the Barun) Mel A NT HA he always difpis’d, but new detested, for the Trick she had put upon him ; yet thought it wou’d be not only unmanly, but barbarous to let her know he did sh : It was in vaiii for him to endeavour to come to a determination after what manner he shou’d behave him-felf to any of them, and when the Night was past in forming a thoufand feveral Refolutions, the Morning found him as much to Seek as before : He took his Leave early of the Baron, not being willing to fee any of the Company after what had happen’d, still he w'^as more Compos’d.
H E was not deceiv’d in his Conjedures concerning Melliora, for Alovysa was no shon-er recover’d from her Swoon, than she with bit-? ter Exclamations told her what had been the Oc-cafion, and put that astonish’d fair one into shch a vissble Dishrder, as had she not been too full of MiSery to take Notice of it, had made her eafily perceive that she was deeply Interested in the Story: but whatever she laid against the

The Chevalier., was in the Height of Dist pair, when he found that Ansellina. continued her Humour, and still avoided letting him know the occafion of it : And Alovysa, tho’ she contented herfelf for Some Hours with relating to her Sister, all the Pastages of her Husband’s unkind Ulage oS Her, yet when that was over, her Curiostty return’d, and she grew fo madly Zealous to find out, who her Rival was, that she repented her Behaviour to the Baron, and Pent him the next Day privately, a Billet, wherein she astur’d him, that she had acquainted the Count with nothing that had pafs’d between them, and that she destr’d to Ipeak with him. ’tis eafy to believe he needed not a Second Invitation ; he came immediately, and Alovysa renew'd her Entreaties in the most pressing

To alleviate the troubles of his Mind, he had endeavour’d all he cou’d, to Mel l 10 r a to continue in his H.oufe ; but that afflicted Lady was not to be prevaird upon, she look’d on her Self, as, in a manner, acceS-fary to A l o v y s a’s Death, and thought the least she ow’d to her Reputation was to fee the Count no more, and tho’ in the forming this Resolution, she felt Torments unconceivable, yet the strength of her Virtue enabled her to keep it, ^nd she return’d to the Monastery, where she had been Educated, carrying with her nothing of that Peace of Miild with which she left it.
Not many Days past’d between her Depar--ture, and the Co u n t’s ; he, took his way towards by the perfwalions of his Brother, who, £nce he found him bent to Travel, hop’d that Garden of the World might produce fome-
thing to divert his Sorrows ; he took but two
Servants with him, and thofe rather for Con-veniency than State: Ambition^ once his darling Palfion, was now wdiolly extinguish’d in him by thefe Misfortunes, and he no longer-thought of making a Figure in the World ; but his Love nothing cou’d abate, and ’tis to be believ’d that the violence of that wou’d have driven him to the ufe of shme fatal Remedy, if the Chevalier Brillian, to whom he left theCareof Mell loRA k and her Brother’s Fortune as well

The Fatal Enquiry,
ks his own, had not, tho’ with much difficiiltj, obtain’d a PromiSe from her of Gonverfing with him by Letter^.
Th i s was all he had to keep Hope alive, and indeed it was no inconfiderable Confblation, for she that allows a Correspondence of that Kind with a Man that has any Interest in her Heart, can never perfuade herfelf, while she
does So, to make him become indifferent to her. When we give our Selves the liberty of even talking of the Perfon we have once lov’d, and find the least pleafure in that DiScourfe, ”tis ridiculous to imagine We are free from that Paffi-on, without which, the mention of it would be but inSipid to our Ears, and the remembrance to bur Minds, tho’ our Words are never fo Cold, they are the effedts of a Secret Fire, which burns not with leSs Strength for not being Dilated^ The C o v N T had too much Experience of all the Walks and Turns of Passion to be ignorant of this, if M E L L I o R A had endeavour’d to dilguiSe her Sentiments, but she Went not sh far, she thought it a Sufficient vindication of her Virtue to withhold the rewarding of his Love, without feigning a ColdneSs to which she was a stranger, and he had the Satisfadtioil to obferve a tendernefs in her Stile, which aS-fur’d him that her Heart was unalterably his, and very much strength’d his Hopes that one day her Perfon might be sh too, when time had a little effac’d the memory of thoSe Circumstances, which had obliged her to put this constraint on her Inclinations !

But, how strangely do they deceive them-Selves, who fancy that they are Lovers, yet on every little Turn of Fortune, or Change of Circumstance, are agitated, with any Vehemence, by Cares of a far different Nature ? Lovi is too jealous, too arbitrary a Monarch to Suffer any other Paffion to equalize himfelf in that Heart where he has fix’d his Throne. When once enter’d, he becoihes the whole BulineSs of our Lives, we Think--we Dream of nothing elfe,nor have a Wish not infpir'd by him: ThoSe who have the Power to apply themfelves So ferioussy to any other Confideration as to forget him, tho’ but for a Moment, are but Lovers in Conceit, and have entertain’d Defire but as an agreeable A* mufement, whicli when attended with any Li-convenience, they may without much difficulty shake off. Such a shrt of Passion may be properly enough call’d Liking^ but falls widely short of Love. Love., is what we can neither refist, expel, nor even alleviate, if we should never So vigoronssy attempt it; and tho’ Some have boasted, Thus jar mil I yield and m farther, they have been convinc’d of the vanity of forming fudi Reshlutions by the impoffibility of keeping them. Liking is a flashy Flame, which is to be kept alive only by eafe and de-

light. Love., needs not this fewel to maintain its Fire, it Survives in AbSence, and Difappoint-
ments, it endures, unchill’d, the wintry Blasts of cold Indifference 'and Neglect, and continues its Blaze, even in a storm of Hatred and Ingratitude, and Reashn, Pride, or a just Senfibility oS conicious Worth, in vain Oppofe it. Diking., plays gayly round, feeds on the Sweets in grofs, but is wholly infenfible of the Thorns which guard the nicer, and more refin’d Delicacies of Dessre, and can consequently give neither Pain, nor Pleafure in any Superlative degree. Love creates intollerable Torments ! unfpealcable Joys! railes us to the highest Heaven of Hap-pinefs, or links us to the lowest Hell of MiSery.
Count D’e l m o n t experienc’d the Truth of this Astertion ; for neither his just concern for the manner of A l o v y s a’s Death cou’d curb the Exuberance of his Joy, when he con-lider’d himfelf belov’d byMELL iora ; nor any Diverlion, of which Rome afforded great Variety, be able to make him Support being abSent from her with Moderation. There are I believe, but few modern Lovers, how Paffionate and Constant shever they pretend to be, who wou’d not in the C o u n t’s Circumstances have found Some matter of ConSolation; but he feem’d wholly dead to Gaiety. lai vain, all the Roman Nobility courted his Acquaintance •, in vain the Ladies made uSe of their utmost Artifice to engage him : He prefer’d a shlitary Walk, a lonely Shade, or the Bank of shme purling Stream, where he undisturb’d might contemplate on his BelovM Me L L I o R A, to all the noify Plea^-

The Count order’d one of his Servants to deliver this Letter to the Pershn who brought the other ; but he return’d immediately with it in his Hand, and told his Lordship that he cou’d not prevail on the Fellow to take it that he Said he had bufinefs with the Count, and must: needs fee him, and was sh Importunate, that he feem’d rather to Demand than Entreat a Grant of his Request. D’ e l m o n t was astonish’d, as well he might, but commanded he should be admitted.
Nothing cou’d be more Comical than the appearance of this Fellow, he feem’d to be about threescore Years of Age, but Time had not been the greatest Enemy to his Face, for the Number of Scars, was far exceeding that of Wrin-cles, he was Tall above the common Stature, but fo lean, that, till he fpoke, he might have been taken for one of thofe Wretches who have past’d the Hands of the Anatomists, nor wou’d his Walk have difipated that Opinion, for all his Motions, as he enter’d the Chamber, had more of the Air of Clockwork, than of Nature; his Drest was not lest particular, he had on a Suit of Cloaths, which might perhaps have been good in the Days of his Great Grand-father,but the Pershn who they fitted must have been five

I think my Self, Madam, Said he, highly indebted to Fortune, for making me the means of your recovering a Jewel, the LoSs of which wou’d certainly have given you Some clffquiet: Oh Heavens! cry’d she, receiving it with an affected Air of Surprize, could a Trifle like this which I knew not that I had let fall, nor perhaps

As she fj)oke thefe Words she contriv’d to let her Vail fall back as if by Accident, and di {cover’d a Face, Beautiful even to Perfe6Hon I Eyes black and fparkling, a Mouth form’d to Invite, a Skin dazlingly white, thro’ which a most delightful Bloom diffus’d a chear-ful Warmth, and glow’d in amorous Blushes on her Cheeks. The Count could not forbear gazing on her with Admiration, and perhaps, was, for a Moment, pretty near receeding from that Infenfibility she had reproach’d him with • but the Image oSMell iora, yet unenjoy’d, all ravishingly Kind and Tender, rofe prefent-ly in his Soul, fill’d all his Faculties, and left no Paffage free for rival Charms. Madam, laid he after a little Paufe, the Italian Ladies take care to skreen their too dazling Lustre behind 3 Cloud, and, if I durst take that Liberty, have certainly reashn to Tax your Accufation of Injustice ; he, on whom the Sun has never vouchsafed to shine, ought not to be condemn’d for not acknowledging its brightnefs; yours is the first Female Face I have beheld, fince my Arrival here, and it wou’d have been as ridiculous to have feign’d my Self fufceptible of Charms which I had never Seen, as it wou’d be Stupidity, not to confefs thofe I now do, worthy Adoration.

. WHi E H Love once becomes in our Power, it fceafes to be worthy of that Name; no Man re* ally poffest with it, can be Master of his A£i:i-ons; and whatever EfFedts it may Enforce, are lio more to be Condeirm’d, than Poverty, Sick-nefs, Deformity, or any other MisSortune incident to Humane Nature.

ought not; but Perfection is not to be expeCted on this fide the Grave : And Since ’tis impofli-ble for Humanity to avoid Frailties of Some kind or other, thofe are certainly least blame-able, which Spring only from a too great Affluence of the nobler Spirits. Covetoitfnefs, ILnv^^ Pride., Revenge., are the Effeds of an Earthy, Bafe, and Sordid Nature, Ambition and Love, of an Exalted one ; and if they are Failings, they are fuch as plead their own Excule, and can never want Forgivenefs from a generous Heart, provided no indired Courfes are taken to procure the Ends of the former, nor Inconstancy, or Ingratitude, stain the Beauty of the latter.

However, I wou’d not ab-folutely refuSehis Offer, but evaded it, which I had the better pretence for, becaufe Violetta, (fo was his Daughter call’d) was gone to Vitterbd to Vifit a fick Relation, and I coffd not have the opportunity of feeing her. Jn the mean time, he made me acquainted with his deepest Secrets; among many other Things he told me, that tho’ their Family was one of the greatest in Rome, yet by the too great Liberality of his Father, himfelf and one Sister was left with very little to Support the Grandeur of their Rirth ; but that his Sistec who was acknowledg’d a Woman of an uncommon Beauty, had the good Fortune to appear fo, to Signior Marcarius Fialafco *, he was the p of immenfe Riches, but very Old; but the young Lady found Charms enough in his Wealth to ballance all other Deficiencies ; She Married, and Buried him in a Month’s Time, and he Py’d fo full of fondnefs to his lovely

His Words left me no room to hope it was any other than Camilla I had Seen, and the Treachery I was guilty of to my Friend, in but wishing to invade his Right, gave me Rcmorfe. which I had never known before: But thefe Reflections lasted not long; Love generally exerts him-Self on thefe Occastons, and is never at a LoSs for means to remove all the Scruples that may be rais’d to oppofe him. Why, Said I to my Self, should I be thus Tormented ? She is not yet married , and ’tis almost impoffible she can with Satisfaftion, ever yield to be sh, to him. Could I but have opportunity to Talk to her,-to let her know my Paffion,— to endeavour to deliver her from the Captivity she is in, perhaps she would not condemn my Temerity: I found a great deal of PleaSure in this Thought, but I wa$ not Suffer’d to enjoy it long : Honour
to me, that CiTTOL IN I Lov’d me, had Oblig’d me, and that to Supplant him would be BaSe and Treacherous : But would it not be more So, cry’d the Dictates of my Love., to permit the Divine Camilla to fall a Sacrifice to one So every way undcServing of her ♦, one who Tis likely she abhors one who deSpiSes her Heart, So he may but poffeSs her Fortune to flip-]>ort his Pride, and her PerSon to gratify a SaiHon far uriwtorthy of the Name of Lave i one,

who ’tis prohahle, when Master of the one, and Satiated with the other, may treat her with the utmost Inhumanity. Thus, for a time, were my Thoughts at Strife •, but Love at length got the Vidor y, and I had fb wel l compos’d my Self before Cittolusti’s Return, that he faw nothing of the Difbrder I had been in but it was not So with him, his Countenance, at the best diSplealing enough, was now the perfedt Representative of 111 Nature, Malice, and Discontent. Camilla had astiiFd him, that nothing could be more her Averfion, and that she was reSolv’d, tbo’ a Monastick Life was what she Bad no Inclination to, yet she would fly to that Shelter, to avoid his Bed. You may imagine, my Lord, I was Tranfported with an Excels of Joy, when he told me this; but Love taught me to diffemble it, Till I had taken, leave of him, which I made an Excufe to do, as loon as poffible.
Now all that troubled me was to find an Opportunity to declare ray PalSion ; and, I con-fefs, I was So dull in Contrivance, that tho’ it took up all my Thoughts, none of them were to any pmrpofe : Three or four Days I Spent in fruitless Projedtions, the last of which I met with a new Embarrallinent ; Cittolini’s Daughter was return’d, he renew’d his Delires of making me his Son, and invited me the next Evening to his Houfe, where I was to be enter tain’d with the Sight of her; I could not well avoid giving him my Promife to be there, but reSolv’d in my Mind sh behave my Self in Such

The calm and refolute Refentment wiiich appear’d in the stile of this Letter, gave Frank-viLLE very just grounds to fear, it wou'd he no Small difficulty to obtain a Pardon for what he kd sh rashly written; but when he reflested on the Seeming ReaSons, which mov’d him to it,and that he shou’d have an opportunity to let her know them, he was not,altogether Inconfolable, he pafs’d the Night however in a world of Anxiety, and as shon as Morning came, hurried a-^ way, to communicate to the Count this fresh oc-calion of his Trouble.
IT was now D’Elmont’s turn to Railly, and
he laugh’d as much at thofe Fears, which he im-magin’d CaufeleSs, as the other had done, at the assignation he had perSwaded him to make with CiAMARA, but, tho’ as most of his Sex are, he was pretty much of the Cor/wFs Opinion, yet, the re-instating himfelf in Camilla’s esteem, was a Matter of too great Importance to him, to Suffer him to take one Moment’s east ’till he was perfedtly affur’d of it.
I
A T last, the wish’d for Hour arriv’d, and he, diSguis’d st as it was impossible for him to be known, attended the Count to that dear Wicket^ which had fo often given him entrance to Camilla ; they waited not long for Admittance, Brione was ready there to receive them ; the

himfelf, ’till she taking the Comt by the Hand
11
in order to lead him to her Lady, bad him wait her return, which she told him fiiou’d be imme-

I N the mean time she conducted the Count to

he had been receiv’d by the shppos’d Camilla,
and where he now beheld the real Ciamara,
drest, if'possible, richer than she was the Night
before, but loofe as wanton Fancy cou’d invent ;
she was lying oii the Couch when he enter’d, and
afteisting to Seem as if she was not prefently shnfible of his being there, role not to receive

The Count aiid VioLETTA were Silent all this Time, and perceiving they were in a fair way of Reconciliation, thought the best they cou’d do to forward it, was to leave ’em to themstlves, and walking a few Paces from them: You Suffer my Lord, laid she, for your Generolity in ac-^ companying your Friend, stnce it condemns.you to the Conversation of a PerSon who has neither Why nor Gaiety shfficient to make her Self Diverting. Thofe, reply’d he who. woii’d make the Excellent Violetta a Subjed of Diverli-f on, ought never to be blest with the Company of any, but Such Women who merit not a Seri7 bus Regard: But you indeed, were your Soul capable of DiScending. to the Follys pf your Sex, wou’d he extreamly at a Lofs in Conver-lation So little (^ualify’d as mine, ta pleafe the Vanities of the fair; and you stand in need of all thofe more than Manly Virtues you poffefs, to pardon a Chagreen, which even your Prefence cannot Dissipate: If it cou’d, interrupted she, I afTure your Lordship, I shou’d much more re-

Madam, faid he, tho'’ 1 dare not Question your Sincerity in any other Point, yet you must give me leave to Disbelieve you in this, not only, becaufe, in mV Opinion, there is nothing sh contemptibly redi-culoiis as that Self Sufficiency, and vain delire of pleafing, commonly known by the Name of Coquetry., butalSo becaufe she who efcapes the Contagion of this Error, will not without much difficulty be led into any other: Alas my Lord, cry’d Violetta, now vastly wide of Truth is this Astertion ? That very foible, which is most pernicious to our Sex, is chiefly by Coquetry prevented : I need not tell you that

Love wou’d be fo far froin being a weaknels, that it wmii’d Serve rather as an Embelishment to yoiir other Graces ; iCs only when we stoop to Objeds below ,oUr Confideration, or;vainly wing our wishes to thofe above: our Hopes that makes us appear rediculous or contemptible ; but either of thefe is a Folly which,-—-which the incomparable Violett a, interrupted D’Elmont^ never can be guilty of: You have -;a very good Opinion of iny Wit reshm’d she, in a melancholly Tone, but I shou’d be much happier than, 1 am, if I Were Sure I cou’d Secure my Self from doing any thing to forfeit it: I believe, feply’d the CpUNT there are not many things you have leSs Rea-Son to apprehend than Such a Change and l am confident were I to stay m Rome as many A^es., as I am determin’d to do but jF/owrr, I shou’d, at last leave it, with the Same Esteem and Admiration of ,ybur_ Singular Yertues, as 1 now shall do. yibLETTA coffd not prevent the Diforder theSe words put her into, from, discovering it Self in the Accent of her Voice, when, Howl My Lord, Said she, are we then to loSe you ? ——Lofe you in So short a Time: As the Count was about to anSwer, Frankville andCam 1 lla joyn’d themi, and looking on Frankville, if any

Extacy, my Soul is Sull of,---- but take the
mighty Meaning in one Word,-----Camilla’s
mine----for ever mine---the Storm is pashand
all the funny Heaven of Love returns to bleSs my future Days with ceafelefs Rax>tures : Now, my Lord, lam ready to attend you in your Journy, this Bright! this beautious Guardian Angel will partake our Flight! and we have nothing now to do, but to x)repare with Secrecy and Speed fit means for our Eshape. As shon as Frankvil-LE had left off Speaking, Cowwt D’Elmont addressing himSelf to Camilla, made her abundance of Retributions, for the haxilpineSs she gave his Friend, which she receiving with a becoming ChearfulneSs, and unaffected Gayety, I am afraid. Said she, your Lordshij) will think a Woman’s Resolution is, henceforth, little wmrth regarding ; but, continu’d she, taking Violetta by the Hand, I fee well, that this unfaithful Creature has betray’d me, and to ])unish her Infidelity, will, by leaving her, pjut it out of her; power to deceive my Confidence again : Violetta either did not hear, or was not in a condition to return her Railery, nor the Praifes which the Count and -MonJieur FrankYille concur’d in of her Generossty, but stood motion-lefs ^nd lost in Thought, ’till Camilla feeing it crow towards Night, told the Gentlemen, she

thought it best to part, not only to avoid any Sufpicion at Home of their being out fo long, but alsh that the others might order every thing proper for their Departure, which it was agreed on between Frankville and her, should be the next Night, to prevent the fuccefs of thoSe mifehievous Defigns she knew Ciamara and CiTToLiNi were forming against both the Count and Monjieur Frankville.
$
Matters being thus adjusted to the entire Satisfatstion of the Lovers, and not in a much lefs proportion to the Count, they all thought it best to avoid inaking any more Appointments tin they met to part no more, which was to be at the Wicket ^t dead of Night. When the Count took leave of Violetta, this being the last time he couM expedt to fee her, she was hardly able to return his Civilities, and much lefs toanfwer thofe which Frankville made her, after the Coujit had turn’d from her to give him way; both of them guefs’d the Caufe of her Confufion, and D.D l m o n t felt a concern in observing it, which nothing but that for Mel-LioRA cou’d Surpafs.
f
The next Day found full Employment for them all, but the Count as well as Franville was too impatient to be gone, to neglect any thing requifite' for their Departure, there was not the least particular wanting, long before the time they were to wait at the Wicket for Camilla’s coming forth : The Counfs Lodging being the nearest, they stay’d there, watchii for the long’d for Hour-, but a little before it

The Young Fidel lo, for So he was call’d, cou'd not wish to be receiv’d with greater Demonstrations of KindneSs than thoSe the Count gave him : And perceiving that Violetta had trusted him with the whole affair of their leaving Rome in private, doubted not of his Conduct, and confulted with him, who they found knew the Place perfectly w^ell, after what manner they should Watch, with the least danger of being discover’d, for Camilla’s opening the Wicket. Frankville was forgoing alone, lest if any of the Servants fliou’d happen to be about, one Pershn would be lefs liable to fufpicion than >if a Company were feen; the Count thought it most proper to go all together, renjembring Frankville of the danger he had lately shap’d, and might again be brought into ;but Fidel lo told them,he wbu’d advife that they two should remain conceal’d in the Portico, of the Convent of St. Francis, while himfelf wou’d watch alone at the Wicket for Camilla, and lead her to them, and then afterwards they might go altogether to that Place where the Hoifes and Servants shou’d attend them; the

The I r eager wishes, and the goodnefs of their Horfes brought them, before Day-break inany Miles' from Rome •, but tho’ they avoided all high-Roads, and travell’d crofs the Country to prevent being met, or overtook by any that inight know them, yet their defire of feeing themfelves in a Place of Security was fb great; that they refus’d' to' stop to take any Refreshment ’till the next Day was almost Spent; but when they were come into the HouSe were they were to lye that Night, not all the fatigue they had endur’d, kept the Lovers from giving and receiving all the Testimonies imaginable of mutual Astedion.	■
