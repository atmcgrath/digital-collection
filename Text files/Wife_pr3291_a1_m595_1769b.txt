A little elegant repast was Served, during which I was still more delighted with my young charmer, who enlivened us all with the Sprightly Sallies of her wit and innocent vivacity.

The old lady told me her history^ in
few words: Her hushand had been an ossicer of Some rank—his death left her in very moderate circumstances; but that, v/ith ceconomy, and the Supply she received from her Son, enabled them still to live genteely in retirement; tho’ it would not be Sussicient to maintain
them in the beau tnonde.

old lady; and she has the most grateSul
heart in the world. Her charming daughters regard me in the light of a brother. The eldest is, however, as I could wish, most unreferved in her obliging caresses—as I could wish, I Say; for the fweet embarraSment of the younger in my company (which all her vivacity cannot conceal) fills my breast with the most flattering hopes. I believe indeed my partiality for her is no longer a Secret to any of the family, tho’ I have not yet made any dire^l propoSals. I ventured yesterday to vent more freely the Soft effufions of my heart to the dear Jenny, as in a ramble we took after dinner I made shift to draw her afide, from the rest of our party, chatting to her on indifferent Subjeffs—at last, however, she stopped—she looked round with a SwQct confusson in her countenance—

Yesterday Saw the commencement of my union with the most lovely of her Sex. Oh!

I took an opportunity particularly to enquire of MrS. Westbury into the state of his affairs; and find he is well born, l»ut far from being in astluent circumstances. She Says, “ He has long diS-
covered, by his behaviour, a passion for her eldest daughter, though he is “ too generous to endeavour to gain her affeclions; as his Sortune is too Small to permit him to think oS marriage, and
Ills Sentiments too just to Suffer him to think oS involving the woman he loves ** in his distreSs.”— She added, “ She ** believed the Silence he impoSed on “ himSelS with regard to this Subjest cost
him no Small pain.”

quantity of hair upon its head, which

Sober-minded folks likewiSe think it frightful—that hair is loaded with powder and pomatum, all little enough too, let me tell you, to keep any degree .of life or heat in the few brains that are in Small particles Scattered about in the cavities of that Soft Scull it covers—the head, upon the whole, has more the appearance of a cockatoo than any thing 1 can at prefent recollefi: to liken it to —-the rest of it chiesty conSists of French Silk, gold fringe.

I SuSpect you have more enemies than you imagine, who watch your ruin. Fly " then to your hushand, your friend, joilf
protector—make an ingenuous confeshon of this last piece of imprudence — he has too much honour, to Suffer his wife’s one moment to remain in danger. — You may be affured,he will instantly discharge -your debt; and I know his generostty too well to think he will even utter the least reproach, when you acknowledge your fnult, and ferioufly promiSe amendment; 2tnd, that you may be the better able to .keep that promiSe, I think it would be

Oh! my dear Sister, if you knew how ardently I long to embrace, to See my dearest Jenny, I am Sure you wteuld for my fake take this propoSal into conSidera- . tion. Sir George is fond of the country ; you once had, and I trust you will again, acquire, a taste for its innocent pleaSures. Perhaps my brother may get leave to accompany you. I am transported with the thoughts of Seeing once more all my friends about me.
We were once a family of harmony ^ and love. Are we not still So ? do you not long to receive the blessing of a tender and affe£fionate mother, whoSe daily prayer is, that she may again be per-• mitted to fold in her maternal arms her darling daughter ?

word that his houSe was shut up, and that it was reported he was gone abroad', - she could not conceal her emotion from me.—I infisted on knowing the cauSe of this new alarm, to quiet my painful ap-prehenfion; for ray terrified imagination had represented it as Something, if possible, still more fatal.—Good Heavens! if my hushand—but she is at last gone to question the Servant who was prefent.—I am in agonies—O Sister, Sister, what will become of me ?

HO W lihcerely do I condole with
you, my dear Mrs. Man waring, on this last fatal accident!—I have now a double cauSe for vengeance—nor shall
the villain eScape my just revenge;—Ah I why did your too impetuous noble bro-
ther interfere ? He has encroached on
,	I
my prerogative.—.Would to Heaven, I had fallen in his stead! How little do I now value my wretched life!—No, with
my Jenny, I lost every joy this world could give.—.You, think her virtuous—O, had she been virtuous, she had been an angel.—May you never, like me, be fatally convinced of ,the contrary 1

Mr. Irwin does not fail, in his humourous way, to rally this impatience; and now and then, by Some rather free expressions, to excite the Sweet modest blushes of my LouiSa, which I hide in my enraptured bofom.
