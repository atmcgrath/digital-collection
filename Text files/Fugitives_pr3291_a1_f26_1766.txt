My Intimacy with the new married Pair still continued ; and I Srequently heard the Confort oS my Friend mention with great Refpect the Name

Soon after our Heroine’s Return to the Metropolis, I was

told me, that his Lady, whom he had oSteii importuned on that Head, had at last gained
the ConSent oS MiSs M-------to
publish the Letters which coh-tained the Memoirs oS her LiSe, Some oS which had been
beSore communicated to me in Confidence.

I undertookthis Office, with PleaSure, and -must confeSs, it was Matter oS SatisSaction to me, to find fo great a Trust repofed in me by theSe amiable Ladies.
In Effect, having expunged all real Names, and Articles oS private Concern, I digested the Work into the F orm which
*
now it bears.
As to the Stile oS thefe Memoirs, I Shall only fay, it is Such, in genera], as is uSiial in epistolary Correspondence, except only, that where Some particular Circumstances have
more
I
( xi )
more immediately affected the Writer, the Piece has often taken a Tincture from it : To this, that Vein of the Pathetic^ which runs through the Work feemsto be owing. The Descriptions, I believe, will be found accurate, and cor-* responding to the best Accounts. If the Scenery is fome-times extraordinary, it is no more So than the Nature of the Story must unavoidably oc-c^ston it to be. As to the mo-1 al Refle x ions interfperfed, they are fuch as appeared to me ap-postte to the Subject, and consequently underwent but few Alterations.
Thus

Thus we have ventured t© prefent the Public with the History of Mifs Lerefa Af—-—, •to whofe Candour its Share of Merit is left to be determined.

However they may decide in this Refpect, if they Should reap from it Instruction and Enter--tainment, it will anSiver the Design of the benevolent Author^ and the Editor will not think his Labour ill bestowed,

-I know not, my Dear, whether you have ever heard me So much as mention the Authors of my Being, fince I could never refieD on the LoSs of them without Anguish, as one of my greatest MiS-fortunes, and a Prelude to all thoSe others-1 was destined'toiexperience.
It was in the City of Brijlol that I first beheld the Light, .My Father was a Clergyman, deScended from an honourable and antient, though not a wealthy Family hr Walese, -my Mother was the Daughter of a rich West-India Mer-. chant, who was So difobliged with her Choice of a ConSort, sthat from the Day they were joined, he never would consent to See his Child. My Parents bore this with a becoming Patience; happy in «ach other, they lived chearful, free,

and innocent. My Grandfather by the Father's Side, was far from being diS^' /pleaSed at the Match; he often Said, he looked on my Mother (though riow en^ tirely void of all the Gifts, of Fortune) to be a TreaSure which exceeded all Wealth.
%
%
Such were his Sentiments; although 'at the fame Time his own Fortune was extremely ssender, and his Son, at his Death, which happened Soon after, found he had nothing to depend on but his Benefice : But this, to a Man of his Mode-^ ration, was Sufficient; he alked of Heaven but the Foffeffion of , his Love in a State above Want, Heaven granted him that, and he was happy, becaufe he eS^ teemed himSelf sh.
Two Years had elapSed, when my Mother proved pregnant, and, in the ufual Period of Time, brought him me as a •Pledge of their Loves. It is Scarce poshble to expreSs my Father’s Joy on this Occa-- fion; he was a PerSon of the tenderest Feelings of Humanity, and his ConSort was by this Event grown still more dear to him: often would he take me in his

Arms, and fervently addreSs himSelf m Prayer to High Heaven to shower down on me its choicest Bleshngs; to make me wiSe and virtuoys, and grant me be-Sides thoSe other Gilts of Fortune denied to him.
I
'As to my other cruel Grandfather, he could never be prevailed on even to See me, though my Parents had often endeavoured to introduce me to him, in order to Soften his heart. He totally re-fuSed all Kind of Connexion with them or me, and most unnaturally> reSolyed to leave his Wealth to Strangers, rather than to a Daughter who had once difbbliged
him. ,	'
My Education was the principal Care ef my Parents, and was, as much as poS-fible, under their ConduD and Inspection.-: But before this could be far advanced, my Mother died, and my Father retired to a Small HouSe, a few Miles distant from the City; no longer able to endure the Sight of a Manfion, where he had once tasted So much Joy, now
turned into a HouSe of Mourning,

Here, Serim^ began my Sorrows; and from this .Dra may I date all my Mrs'-fortunes.
IVfe, the Jitcle early Mourner of my Mother, he took along with him, and cherished a& his yet Surviving Hope. With my PreSence alone he shlaced him-Self in his Retirement, which Nothing but the Duties of his Fundlion interrupt-^ cd	all otheir^ Times were in a Manner
Sacred to his' Grief; which ended in a Melancholy, that preyed on his Spirits, and reduced him to the Shadow of hi^ ' former Self, >
I
Sequestered from Social Converfe and the Haunts of Men, he Spent the tedioi^ Hours in all the Duties of a religious Life. Worn as he was with Care, Sibk-neSs at last Seized him ; well he knew it the Harbinger of Death, and in Proportion as it approached, contrary to the Generality of Mortals, he grew calmer, more compofed, ai>d even mox® chear-stil.

In his, dying Moments, my Fafher^^ «onfigned me to the Care of his Sister, who was by this Time become the Re- -HD of a Gentleman of Fortune, and who promised to take the greatest Care of me, for whom she had indeed always appear- • #d to entertain a great Regard.
My Father embraced me tenderly, snd turning to my Aunt: ‘ My dear-Sister, laid he,, v/hen. my beloved So--. 'phia died, to me she commended this . Offspring of our mutual Love. Alas l -

Indeed I had Caush1 Saw him no-more ; for within a few Hours he e:§:-‘ pired, and my Aunt took Possession of the Houfe, which, as Soon as she had fettled all affairs relative to my deceafed Parent, she quitted, taking me with herr to a Seat of iiex kte Huiband’s in the Country,
»
To do Justice to her Memory, I will own I had no Reafon to complain of her Behaviour towards me, from the Time of my leaving my Father’s FlouSe till my Sixteenth Year; during which Inter- -val I was educated with her own Daugk- -ter Charlotte, who was nearly of my Age.
About this Time the Son and Heir of Sir yarned Lovell, a neighbouring Baro-Jiet. of a great estate, fecretly paid his
B 4.,.	Addresses-

Addresses to this my Coiifin, contrary t6 ; the Commands of his Father, who would . have matched him elSewhere..
My Aunt was well acquainted with'the-Affair, and encouraged the young Gentleman in his Disobedience, endeavour-** ing,, by every Means in her Power, to firomote a Match between her Daughter-and the Son oS the Baronet.,.,
But CharloUe not he Art oS Leep^ ing a Lover’s Affedfions.., Shewas indeed kmdSome; but she had at that Time So large a Share of Affe<5fation, that her haughty and ridiculous Airs proved diff gustSul to her Lover, and, in the End, lost her the Conquest which her Eyes had ■gained.
My Aunt, who had Seen with PleaSure this .growing Passion, you may well imagine, was chagrined TO perceive it decreasing, and would Sain have renewed its Force : But the Youth had good SenSe, and his awakened ReaSon conquered in Time thoSe Ardours, which the Power of Charms merely exterior had excited in his Breast.

Whilst Affairs were thus fitusted, I was removed to a Friend’s HouSe at Some Distance. On my Return, my Aunt advanced to receive me, accompanied by Mr. Lovell. I had never Seen him be-; fore. He Seemed greatly conSuSe.', and handed me out of the Coach with a trembling Emotion: Then, turning to my Aunt, ‘ Mrs. Alneyf LdSd. he,,, (that was her Name, ‘ Is this Lady a Relation ?' She replied ‘ Yes, Sir, it is the. Girl I ‘ mentioned to you.: My Brother, dying,, ‘ leSt her to my Care.' ‘ Your Niece f-‘ Then, Madam, with your Permiffion— (Saluting me, while my Cheeks were dyed with Scarlet) ‘ A fine young Lady !
^ I should be happy in her. Acquaintance.* ‘" The Girl is handSome—that is—I meaa ® she is well enough,' returned she, much .disconcerted.
I	will confeSs to you,	that I
was greatly struck with the agreeable Figure and engaging AddreSs of this a-miable young Gentleman.. He was just turned of Eighteen, tall, well-shaped, and graceful ;. The RoSe of Health bloomed •n Jjis Cheek, his Eyes were large, black,

and piercing, his Hair and Eyebrows of a dark Colour; his Manner was manly. Sensible, Sprightly, and engaging. In a Word, he Seemed to poffeSs all that my Imagination could Sorm agreeable in , his Sex.
His Vifits vrere, from this Time more frequent, at my Aunt’s ; yet his Beha- . viour grew, more cool than ever towards . MiSs Charlotte. The Mystery of this Mrs. Alney, eafily penetrated : That Lady perceived Mr. Lovell had conceived a Passion for me, in ConSequence of which,, in a little Time ..after , I began to be^mal-
treatedo.
On the least Pretence imaginable I was .. ordered to my Chamber. I'could not conduD mySelf by any Rule which would . not offend : If I Spoke in Company, I ; was too forward}, if I held my Peace, I was Jullen. My Pride was often excepted m against; and my Coufin, now my Enemy; liSed to tell me ‘ Ishat I ought not to encourage So proud a Spirit, Since my

The Pleading of a Man. we love is-Mufic to our Ears. I stood fixed to hear ' him, and forgot my FromiSe. 1 let him,, know, in my 1 urn, how much Mrs. A/-ney had dtceived us both : He then fell at my F'eet, and breathed the most ardent Vows ; I recollected,,and urged my PromiSe; he argued ‘ 1 hat to deceive, Deceivers was but just He pressed, me eagerly to admit of his Suit, pro- • mifing the most reSpeCtful Behaviour.^. What could I, do, Strina f — Perhaps I, was to blami^ ; — perhaps I ought not to have yielded : Yet had you beheld the,; kneeling Lover, had you Seen the melting Languishm.ent of his Eyes, the ardent .. SuSpirations of his imipafiioned BoSom; had you heard him pleading with all the tender Eloquence of Love, you could not have reSuSed his Suit. I Said I know net, whatbut it was Some Word of Encou- • ragement; for he role, and Seizing my . Hand, imprinted on it an ardent KiSs.

Have you beheld, Senna, the Welcome with which the rough Blasts of Aujter are received by the ripened Corn, when his rude tempestuous Breath low bends the waving Harvest, and threatens Ruin to the Farmer’s Hope:—With Such a Welcome, trembling and appal’d, did I receive the rough Salute of this my uncouth Lover, whoSe very Form leemed a ContradiDion to his Suit; while his Voice, far from, being atuned to the Sweet Notes of Love, broke forth in hoarSe Murmurs from the Hollow of his mis-shapen 'I'runk, like Winds pent up, and struggling for a PaS-iage.

My Compliance would (when ‘ the first Transports of a violent Love ‘ liad Subfided) render me contemptible ‘ in your Eyes, as one who had,, poorly ‘ endeavoured to raiSe her Fortune at the ‘ Expence of her Integrity. I must far-‘ ther add, I can no longer confent to ‘ Subfist on your Bounty: I own, indeed,
‘ your Behaviour has been Such as if you.
rather received a Favour, than conferred ‘ one; yet at the fame Time I cannot but ‘ confider, Lh.at the Delicacy of a Woman may he hurt in receiving Juch Favours as ‘ do Honour to the Generoftty of a Lover m bejlowing. In fine, if you will then ‘ oblige me, I intreat you no more to

*' ting me in an independent State, re-lying on my Heart for its Gratitude and Esteem.’

‘ Gratitude! what Gratitude, what teem ? (cried Mr. Lovell hastily) No--‘ thing but this cold Return ? Oh, TerefaJ what Claim have I to Gratitu^ or Ef-‘ teem^ if not to Love f Heavens 1 Can you

I was moved.; yet I reSumed the Ar*? gument against, a clandestine Marriage,
' Alas! Mr. Lovell, (Said I) what do you ‘ Seek ?—Can Happinefs be the ConSe-

Soon .after, Mx. Lovell was Summoned into the Country:. He Said he could not think of leaving me: I uSed every Argument I could think on, to perSuade him into a Compliance. At length I prevailed on .him, and he. left me in a Situation agreeable enough, the Pain excepted of parting, from one whom I really loved. At Parting,, he preSehted me with a Miniature of himfelf, which I hung to my Watch, and which afterwards-

If I thought mySelf happy where was fituated. Lady Sewel Seemed .no leSs, pleaSed with me.. She.was a PerSon who liept much Company, and I was, ia ConSequence, introduced by her to the fashionable World: But of all thoSe who frequented her HouSe, the most parti-, culaf Vilitors were Sir	Brooks
and the young Lord Clarey ; the former of theSe was a Gentleman of a manly Deportment, and many shiriingAccom-plishnaents; the latter, though, to do him^. justice, he had a quick Genius and great Talents, joined to a high Spirit, had yet So. much of Pride, arid fb great a Mix- -ture of the Libertine in his CharaDer,

as weighed in the equal Balance of Reashii. would preponderate,,and; turri the Scale* against them. With. theSe, however, he. pasted in general fOr a PerSon pf a noble
Spirit, and an accomplished .Gentleman, .
-
One Day, when both theSe Smtors (for. Such they really were) had just left lady ■SnveL she retired to her CloSet, and Sent me a Note, importing that she would be , glad to Speak with me there. I attended, and found her Ladyship fitting in a very

* Though I could not conceive what ■	^ should follow this sh Solemn Preparation,

I must own, Serina^, L, was much em- -barraffed at this Qijestion; for though the -Choice, w'^as eafy to an unprejudiced Per-Son between the two Gentlemen, yet, notwithstanding all that Lady Sewel had Said,
1 had Some Reafon to imagine, that her Inclinations biassed her in Favour of Lord. Clarey. It i& impossible for .any Woman, to regard two Lovers with an equal Af- -fe6tion, if she really likes either;—she must love, only one, or be indifferent to both.—=-This I hinted at as modestly as I could to her Ladyship; but she still per-. listed in. her Equality of.

I could plainly perceive that I had really diSpleaSed Lady SeweI by obeying her Commands, So dangerous a Thing is it to Speak one’s Mind in Such CaSes; but i this was a Lesson which I had not yet learned, though I was tolerably able to Support an Argument; and indeed the Vanity of displaying that Talent, .more than, once cost me dear.

But the Peer,, one Morning, enterings the Saloon, before Lady Sewel was up, found me there alone reading, and, glad of the Opportunity, began a DifcourSe-with me, which Iwould fain have avoided,, but that' good Manners obliged me to entertain his Lordship.—After Some Time,,-I was Surprized to hear the eaSy Astiirance with which this baSe Nobleman declared himfelf my Lover.,, At first, I wculd-i have passed it off with a Smile, but as he grew more Serious, I will own to you Serina, I treated it as the highest InfuU upon my SenSe, to SuppoSe I could listen, to one, who but the Day before, had in my Prefence,, been making the Same, Protestations to her Ladyship.

O W oSten, my Smna, are we 1®^ H ^ then Sarthest Srom the Poffeshon
of our Wishes, when we fondly imagine them just within our Reach! There is a certain Phantom, the empty Shade of Felicity, which assumes its Shape but to deceive us: With Eager-neSs we purSue the fleeting Vifiori, which fades at our Approach; and, eluding our Grafp, like the fabled Fruits of Tantalus, leaves us by So much the more unhappy, as before we were elated.
The Morning after my unexpeDed Meeting with Mr. LoveU, was that fixed for my Return from Lady BrooksA, and

he infisted on accompanying me home.
But when he Sound it was with MiSs Do-nor a Seymour that I lived, he Seemed diS-eoncerted; I was alarmed, and my Astonishment was increaSed, when preSenting me to her, my Lover exclaimed * To.
' this Lady my Vows are engaged ; re-‘ proach me then no more with inSenfi-‘ bility.’—‘ What Lerefa ! engaged to Terefa f (ecchoed Leonora) then am I.
* indeed unhappy.’ and Swooned away :.
All poffible Means were uSed for, her Le-eovery; but the unhappy Beauty fell from, one fainting Fit into another. The CauSe of all this was now but too plain : It was • at the Houfe of Mr. Seymour,, during my
Abfence, that Mr. Lavell. had been en-
^ *•
^ tertaineddeceived by the feigned Name, of Lracely, my PatroneSs indulged a Paffion for him, which, had she known him for my Lover, (being no Stranger to his Name, though she was. to his Perfon) she would have stlfied in its Birth. But the Son of Sir James, unwilling to diScover himSelf to Strangers, occalioned this Misfortune ; nor indeed would he have found me, had not Lady Brooks met him acci-< entally in the Street, and stopped her Carriage to fpeak'to him; after which her

But Mr. Seymour, enraged at this unlucky Event, which occafioned his beloved Sister a long and dangerous SickneSs; could not endure the Sight of my Lover, and Sormally forbade him the HouSe, and me he treated with a Sort oS Sormal Com-plaiSance. In Proportion as MiSs Sey~ mouPs Condition grew worSe,.my LSf« became a Burden to me ; I was, in my own Eyes, like one who fits lamenting, deSolate, and Sorlorn, amidst the Ruins of her Country, or the Graves of her Friends: I beheld my ProteDors estranged, my Lover forbidden to approach me; and I dreaded every Day Some rafii Adtion from the latter, in ConSequence of that Prohibition. Lady Brooks, informed of my unhappy Situation, offered herSeif as a Mediatrix with the angry Mr. mour, but in vain: By her Ladyship's Means, however, v/e had Some stolen Interviews ; returning from one of which,
I was informed that MiSs Leonora defired to fee me, her Brother being gone from Home...

Being arrived at a inean HouSe, on our enquiring Sor her, we were conduced into a Two-Pair oS Stairs Back-Room, where over a Mor-Sei of Fire, Sate a pretty young Girl with a Child in her Arms. Misfortune and 'MiSery, Care and Penury, Seemed to have been long the Inhabitants of this wretched Manfion.

Many Circumstances appeared to corroborate her Story, and I no longer had any Doubt concerning the Perstdy of my Lover.

Meanwhile Mr. Lovell, being refuSecf ’ Admittance, in ConSequence oS this AS* fair, grew So very importunate, that as I had firmly reSolved not to See him, it was judged proper that I should accept the. Invitation of Mr. Milner, now again repeated; and I accordingly Set out Sor.

We had on board a Female Paffenger
oS the Name oS L--, who being a Perr
Son of Small Fortune, was Sent for over , by a rich Uncle oS hers, to live with him in India. This Lady was often the Companion of my melancholy Hours, and her agreeable SprightlineSs uSed to divert me. I'hough young, she was a PerSon ©f found Judgement as well as good SenSe; had • not only a ready Wit, but alSo the Art of restraining thoSe more immoderate SaL lies of it, which are So often prejudicial. She was Sweet tempered and agreeable. As for her Perfon, she was tall, and rather' inclinable to be thin, but extremely well shaped. Her Hair was of a glossy brown, her Eyes hazel, her Eyebrows rather dark and high atehed, her Features Soft and delicate, her Complexion 'was fair to a Fault, her BoSom Snowy white, her Skin Smooth and clear, and though she could not be termed a perSedt Beauty, she was at the least a very agreeable Lady.
A
She communicated her Story to me in ^ Confidence. She Said she was the Daughter of a rich Merchant, who was envied by many for his large Dealings, and great
Succefik

F U G I T 1 V F S. 93
SucceSs in Trade, which however tempted him atdast tO' his Rum ; for being remarkable in his good Fortune in all his IJndertakings, he reSolved never again to inSure any Ship or Cargo. He had at one Time, a great Concern embarked on board Some Vessels which were returning, richly Sreighted from the Indies. Before they arrived a War broke out, yet he could not be perSuaded to inSure ; they were taken, and he lost all he had on board, together with his Share of the Ships, of which likewise, he was Part-Owner.
‘ Notwithstanding this LoSs, (continu-
*	ed the young Lady) and though my ‘ Father was So much injured in his Stock,
‘ that he was obliged for Some Time to
stop Payment, yet was he So infatuated, ‘ that he would not inSure two other Sh'ps, ‘ which he had in the Lijhon Trade. He ‘ exulted greatly when he heard one of
*	them had been Spoken with at Sea, ‘ within a few Days Sail of the Lizard; ‘ but his Joy was Soon turned into Mourn-‘ ing, when the next Nev/s he hdard was,
*	that she wws wrecked on the Rocks of Scilly. With her, andher unhappy Crew, perished the Hopes of my Father, who

‘ became a Bankrupt. As to the other ‘ Vestel, she was obServed in the Bay of ^ Bifcay, the Evening preceding a Severe ‘ Gale of Wind, when she disappeared ‘ on the Sudden, and was never heard of ^ more.
‘ Such complicated Misfortunes, fob ‘ lowing Such an uninterrupted Series of ‘ SucceSs, had So deep an EffeD on my ‘ Father, that hefickened and died, leav-‘ ing me to the Care of my Mother,
*	who Supported herSelf and me, on a ‘ little paternal Inheritance of Sixty Pounds ‘ a Year, having given up her Jointure ‘ from a Principle of Honesty to the ‘ Creditors.

‘ We Soon found ourSelves deferted by
*	many of thoSe Friends who had balked
*	in the Sunshine of ProSperity^ and my ‘ Mother, willing to withdraw frona

At last, propofing to ‘ take me with a Lady oS his Acquaint-‘ ance, on a Party oS PleaSure, he be-‘ trayed his wicked Defigns, being warm ‘ with Wine, by making, when he had ‘ got me alone, a vile Attempt upon my ‘ Honour, but Company coming up, I ‘ eScaped his devilish PurpoSe. However,
‘ his Credit was Such, that Sailing in his
S ‘ Defigns upon my Chastity, he has ‘ blasted my CharaDer in the Country,
‘ and it is from that, as miUch as any ^ CauSe, that I leave England.’
I was not amazed after what I had experienced, to hear of Lord CDr<^’s BaSe-nefs to this young Innocent. I. recited in Return, my Adventures, and gave her to understand what Share that Nobleman had in my Misfortunes. We were, in Some ReSpeDs, Sisters in Calamity, and this endeared us the more to each other.
As to the Officers, though they were good-natured and Social, the chief

He had all that TenderneSs which was requifite to recommend him to a Woman, joined to the -most intrepid Spirit, and dauntleSs Courage. The Sailors, feared, reSpedfed and loved him, and the Captain was always Safe in committing the Vessel to his Charge, as he was an experienced Seaman.

We ‘passed the Time as agreeably as could be expedted, and this Officer was perpe tually in our Company. For my own 'Part, I who had experienced what Love v/as, thought I traced Somewhat very like

Among the many Vifitors whofrequent-cd our HouSe, there was a! young Merchant of the Name of Fenton, who (as. the Major’s Lady often ufed to fay) appeared to be in Love. She was not wrong in her ConjeDure; for, in a short Time,, this Gentleman publicly avowed a Paffibn ' for me, which most People eitpedSed i should be glad to cherish j as he was rich,’ and ipossessed bessdes many perSonal Ac-' complishments, Such as might Seem worthy of the Regastd of any Woman,. wshoSe Affedfions were not engaged.

Mr. Fenton did not think my AnSwer by any Means fussicient, and continued his Addresses, which I now began to look upon as mere Matter of Form, and, in ConSequence, treated with, a Sort of Rate lery, which I afterwards repented. Not able to find the real CauSe of my Refu-lal, his Fancy conjured up an imaginary one; So industrious are Some People to torment themSelves.—He had noticed the frequent Vifits of Mr. Drew at our HouSe,. and being ignorant of his Paffion for MiSs L-—, attributed them to me, and fixed on him for a Rival.
Possessed with this falSe Notion, he one Day took upon him to wait on, that Officer, and demand, whether fie paid his Addresses to me ? Ishough muck Surprized, and in Some Degree offended at

When I recovered from my Fit, I perceived Mrs. S-----------standing by me.
I alked her what was become of the ^ Gentlemen, She told me they Were both, alive, and added every thing’file could think of to comfort me: As for Mr. Vre'iv,
. the Major’s Lady infisted as he got his Hurt near her HouSe, he should remain, there till- he-was cured.. He was accordingly conveyed to a Chamber, which it , was above fix Weeks beSore he could stir out oS.
A Fever attended the Suppuration of; the Wound,, which was likely to cost him his Life. MiSs L-— was almost distraD-ed; you may judge my Situation, when I confidered mySelf as the unhappy GauSe of all this MilchleS.
It Seems Mr. Fenton, rash as he was, SstSpeDing Mr. Drew had not told him Truth, had him watched to Mrs. —-—’s-Door, and followed him Soon after he was entered, demanding whether ld.h. Drew was within ? I'he Servant anSwered ‘ Yes..

That 'Gentleman, thus put upon his DeSence, engaged him, and in tire End, ran him quite ‘through; though not vWsth*-out having himSelS received a deep Wound in his Side from shis Antagonish

The Istand of Bombay is In itSelf almost a- mere Rock, and its chief USe to the Company is its. Serving as a Magazine for all India.Its natural Produce will nor ’■ Subfist its own proper inhabitants for Six Months in'the Year,, and it abounds in.. Nothing .but .venomous Animals. Yet this Istand, , not-. Thirty Miles in Circumference is well enough peopled, and is a great Mart for Goods, with which it is Supplied ftom Ferjia, China, and the oppostte Coast: And in this the Black Merchants, find their Account, as they, vend all their Commodities at very higte Rates.

For three.Days and.Dights the Storm increased, till all our Sails were obligejd to-^ be furled, which was a bad Confideration, especially as we-were beating off a dangerous Coast, towards • which . a strong . Currents was perpetually Setting us; and the Weather pr^ ^ ented any Observation.

though equally strong, proved more variable; and.it v/as well Sor us it did So. About Eight, the Captain. Saw the Rocks on-' the Coast, towards which we )vere driving in a high Sea,, and without a Pro-fpeD of eScaping. The Sails which the. Seamen had beSore endeavoured to Set, were shivered to Pieces, and the Gale not. abating, left no Room to hope any Thing from a Second Attempt.
The exceffive Noife had alarmed me,, and I hastened upon Deck,, from whence ' I law but too plainly what -1 deemed our Approaching Destrudfion. The most experienced Sailors deSpaired, and pale Horror Sate upon every Countenance : The Captain intreated me to retireI did So, waiting the Moment in which w^e. should be Swallowed by the raging Deep, whoSe Waves broke like Thunder over our Heads. I found Mrs. Drew in the Cabin, who, though Ihe knew not Half ' our Danger, was yet extremely affrighted.. I endeavoured to comfort her; Heaven, knows how much I stood mySelf in Need of the ConSolation I administered !

At last the Ship Seemed, to. fall..on-her Side, with a terrible Shock; which let .in... the Sea in Such a .Quantity as I doubted . not but we .were lost, and Sell motionleSs on the Deck.,' When I recovered, I found .. Mrs. Drew and the Captain both buSy in assisting me; ‘ What then (Said I with a - :; ‘ feeble Voice) are we still Inhabitants of.. ‘ this World?’ ‘ Yes, Madam, thank ‘ Heaven, (replied he) and So I hope-we ‘ are likely to she: A/Squall from the ‘ right Quarter, to which we Set our Sails ‘ in our DistreSs, has cleared us, as we ‘ w^ere on the .

I returned;.Dhanks-.to Heaven for this-our unexpeHed Deliverance, and by Degrees recovered my exhausted, Spirits. As for Mr, .Cn/r^’, during all this Time, he. was lick, and kept shis Cabin: He was however alv.'ays ready to hope for the

I am not ashamed, Serina, to own the rapturous Joy I felt at that Moment; it was the chaste PleaSure of virtuous Love. If it were possible, the Transports of my dear Lovell were yet stronger.

The Dutch Merchant stood awhile asto-. nished, but Soon Saw whence our Raptures proceeded, and being leSs phle-gmatiG, than most of his Countrymen, he shared in our Joy.

The Captain and his Lady testified the. fiiicerest Joy in our HappineSs, and, ihr-corided KAxS Lovdl in his Sollicitations, that I would give him my Hand before we embarked again fox England; but ever steady to my PurpoSe, and Scrupulous with regard to my first Declaration, this I would by no Means conSent to, and was reSolved not to be joined with him in Wedlock, till Sir James’s ConSent and Prefence should fandtify the Nuptials.

he gave us the Sollowing Relation.

^ whoSe Beauty and AddreSs he extolled to the Skies, and amongst many other Pieces oS her Art, related this Story,
‘ adding, that she had, powerSul Support-ers. But Soon as they arrived, the pretended MiSs Sedley, at Sight of La-dy Brooks’s Livery, cried out she was betrayed, and feU into Fits.

‘ The Butler, who was'no Stranger to ' all that had pasted with Regard to me,
‘ Secured her, and Sent for me and his ^ Lady .“We came, and now by Threats, got the whole Secret from her.
' * In EffedS, it appeared she was origl-‘ nally a reputable wholeSale .Dealef’s ‘ Daughter in the Country, who had ‘ been Seduced first, and then abandoned by Lord Clarey, and thatNobleman,
‘ who always hated me, and had befides ' ‘ many Reashns to wish to prevent otir '* Union, (fince if I die childlefs, a Part of the Estate of our Family reverts to his,

■	‘ not whether it were better to put an

‘ Enemy.—At last, my cooler ReaSon ‘ Suggested a Thought of following you ‘ to the East, and I entered mySelf at the
^ Jnciia-Houfe, as a Cadet to Bombay.
%
‘ There was an Officer on ;”board,
5 whoSe Company was very agreeable to
*	me, and whofe Name was Aubrey. He ^ had been crossed in his first . Love,
‘. for a young Lady, whofe Parents hav-^ ing matched her, against 'her .IncXina-‘ tions, to another. Grief So, preyed on
*	on her Spirits, that she Survived not a-
‘ bove
N
The FAITHFUL
bove three Months her unhappy Nup-
*	tials, and died a VidSim to the Cruelty of her unnatural Relations.
t
‘ Her Death sh much affedfed the
*	Lover, that ’he reSolved no. longer to stay in a Land, where every Scene re-
*	minded him of his LoSs. In his earlier '• Years he had Studied Navigation, be-
ing originally intended Lor a Sea-Osh-^ cer, but dissuaded from thence by his Friends. He now reSolved to take up ‘ that Way of Life, and entered as one '	- of the Mates, on board oS the India-
man that 1 was embarked in.
9
When We put in at the Cape, he ^ came on Shore with me. As we under-‘ stood-the Captain would not Sail for four ‘ Days, we diSpoSed of ourSelves accord-A ingly; rambling a great Way up the ^ Country, and ;pleafing ourSelves with the beautiful and romantic ProSpedfs.
‘ But while we were- thus diverting ‘ ourSelves, on the Night of the Second Day, the Captain weighed Anchor,
^ and Set Sail, after having hoisted a
Sig-
/
* * »
‘F U ' G 'I T I V E si 1-45
*'’* Signal, and fired a Gun, for us to come ^ on board, neither of-which we Saw or ‘ heard. The- third Dav in the Mornlne,
^ mo, returned to the Port, and weredur-‘ prized to hear that our Companions were Sailed without us. I took out my ‘ Pocket-GlaSs,' and plainly-perceived the ‘ Vessel, crowding all'-her-Sails, at the ‘ Distance of-about eight Leagues.
‘-d was much diSconccrted at- this Ac-
•	cident, but feeing no Remedy, I bore ‘ it as I might: I found we must wait ‘ till Some outward-bound Ship, Sliould
^	’ put in there. Mr. Aubrey Soon after
‘ departed -this Life, • and left (almost ‘ without a Sigh) -a World where -he had
*	lost all Hopes of PlappineSs.
t
‘ Mynheer 703?! Glycht, a Dutch’Mer-‘ chant receiv^ed and entertained me from ‘ That Time, till Heaven - was pleaSed to ‘ recompense all my Sufferings, byre-*-storing to me wliat-1 deemed lost for ‘ ever.

’. with a Smile, enjoying in Security all the Fruits oS Love, Innocence, and Peace.-’■
\
Thus concluded my Lover, with an agreeable Prefage of future HappineSs,-which now fully posseffed his Soul. But it was otherwise with, me : Though I was pleafed with Mr. Dovt’/Z’s Justification of himSelf, and though Ishad ail the ReaSon in the World to believe that my Misfortunes were verging towards a Conclufion j yet my Heart did not experience a real ' Happinefsbut as at the Eve of Some great Event, tumultuous Paffions reigned within my BoSom, and I was far from .poffeffing that tranquil State which is the Test of Felicity ; a State that is the ReSuIt of Transports calmed, of Rapture fiiblided and mellowed by Time, into a ferene end Settled Joy.--This Stage of Happinefs is indeed an Emblem of what the Blest above enjoy; and thofe who posseSs it, have a Sort of Foretaste of future BHSs.

The Seamen hailed with Shouts of Joy their native Shore; Eccho returned the Sound, and the pleaSed Ocean Smoothed his Waves, attentive to the Notes.

Life oS Torment. His End was now approaching, and he who had ever affecsted to be a DeSpiSer oS the Precepts oS Heaven, now felt it terrible in its Judgments.
Nor were his Torments confined to his Body alone —miserable as he was, his Mind Suffered likewife. That good Senfe and Learning, thoSe-shining Talents

At Some Times, he Sunk in a deep Melancholy. At others, his Eyes rollect wildly, and a Kind of Frenzy Seized hi in, which Seemed wholly to poffeSs his tortured and deSpairirig Soul.
When I approached his Lordship,' fixing his Eyes upon me, and railing hirnSelf, in a Speech, interrupted with frequent Groans, he thus addressed me,
‘ I Sent for ymu, MiSs iVf----to be-

The next Morteiilg stve were informed that his Lordship had expired, in the ex-tremest Agonies of Body and Mind. His Fortune deScended to a near Relation of Mr. LovelPs.	^
As for his Mother, the pious Lady Greville, she lived not to See this her Son’s unhappy End ; the stIentTomb had long fiiice received, and Spared her the Heartbreaking of Such a Sight.
The Peer had long- gone on in a CourSe of Wickednefs and Debauchery: Our helpleSs Sex had been his constant Prey, and he had made a PraDice of ruining thofe wshofe too eaSy Faith led them to hearken to his inlidious Addresses, and then abandoning them to Shame and

* His PerSon, his AddreSs, and his Station in LiSe, were all made by him Sub-Servient to his vile Schemes, in the ProSe-cutiori oS which he stopped at Nothing. He was belides oS a bold and deSperate Spirit, fierce, haughty, and overbearing, and ever ready to Support one bad Aftion by another; yet, wdth all theSe ill Qualities, he knew but too well how to inlinuate himSelS into the Affebdions oS

What a narrow EScape had I, Serimy
Srom his Lordship’s HouSe !-1 owed it,
as I afterwards learned, to the Fright of his Country Footboy, whoSe Concern for his Master’s Life, which he fuppoSed to be in Danger, was So great, that he Scarcely knew wFat -he did, and, in die Midst of his Confufion, left a Candle burning under a Shelf, that caught Fire, and Set the Houfe in a Flame, v/hich was much damaged, and with Difficulty Saved from being entirely conSumed.

The Wound which Lord Clarey had given himfelf was but a Scratch : As for

the pretended Surgeon, he was a Creature of the Peer, who indeed was never without Such People to forward his Schemes ; Such were many of thoSe whom he cauSed to be admitted as Domestics in. Lady GreviilKs- Family, and who were privy to. his Plot upon me, when first he got me into his Power.
After teat Lady’s Death, this her Sons who became poffeffed. of her Jointure? grew more abandoned than before, and w^as absolutely engaged in a Defign upon a young Lady of Small Fortune, when his Adventure with the Son of Sir James put a Stop to his CourSe, and the fatal Mistake already mentioned, put an End to
fiis Life.

It is a melancholy Reflexion, Serinay. that many young Heirs of illustrious Fa-, milies Seem to copy the Character of Lord Clarey; yet it is no leSs melancholy than, true. Many whoSe high Station in Life ought to Set them as Ihining Patterns of Virtue to their Inferiors, Spend their Youth in,a Round of Riot and De-

bauchery, making their Boast oS ruining Innocence, and where they cannot, Seduce, are Sure to defame.
Can Such .a ConduD become Nobility ? ■ Does it not degrade the very Dignity of-: Rank and Quality,. and even of Huma- -nity itSeif ?: For my Part,. 1 have indeed ever regarded theSe People with the utmost Contempt, and So, I believe do alh the virtuous and thinking Part-of theirr ’ own Sex. ,
Lord Clarey, who icLihis gayer - Hours had'been Surrounded by, Crowds oS giit--tering Fops and dissolute, Youths oS Fortune, was in his last Moments without a .

Epistle, my dear Serim, ^ rp ^ will conclude the Story oS my
unhappy Adventures; Sor un-happy they were, ^ till the Period in which you became acquainted with, me : Since that Time I have indeed had. no ReaSon to repine. Heaven, which ordained that I should experience the rudest Shocks of AstliDion, was pleaSed at lash to condush me to as happy a State as I cm hope to enjoy on this Side of the: Grave.
ft
Believe me, my Friend, perfefi FeK-city , is but an imaginary Being, which, thoSe w:hoSeekxOn Earth, must, ever re-
turm
\
2c6 The FAITHFUL
turn from the PurSuit oS, empty and disappointed.
But the State nearest allied to pure HappineSs, is that oS him who is blessed ' with Content. I mean not here to moralize with thoSe PhiloSophers, who being gS Opinion that be who had the fewest Wants was happiest, threw away, for that ReaSon, the real Necessaries of Life. All I would be understood to inculcate, is, That he who is bleffed with Health, and enjoys the Society of his Friends in a State above Want, and yet complains he is unhappy, will still remain So, though he should exchange his Competency for all the Riches and Honours the World could bestow.
Here I would obServe, . That if Opinion be not the Sole constituent Principle and true Standard of HappineSs, it is yet one of the most necessary Ingredients in it : And if one who in a miserable Situation tinnks himfelf happy, cannot (striD-ly Speaking) be accounted So ; He has at least greatly the Advantage of him, who-
though

though poffeffed of every other Bleffing, Wants that Opinion.
But to leave this Digreffion.—I had now given over all Thoughts oS ever Seeing my Lover again, and had refigned mySelS as well as I was able to my Fate, counting the tedious Honrs as- So many Obstacles in my Way to the Harbour of' Peace.
All PleaSures • became tastelefs, and every Bleffing uS LiSe with me had lost its Charms: All SeaSons w’ere to me alike ; In vain Sor me were Scattered the blooming Flowers of Spring; the purple Stores of Autumn were lavilhed in vain upon me. Summer and Winter, Day and Night, were equally tedious; So true it is that every Scene and Situation in Life, each external ObjeD, takes its Tindture from the Frame of our Minds, and pleaSes or diSpleaSes but as they are af-ledSed.
Whilst I was thus wasting my Time in Sorrow, Word was one Day brought me, that a Gentleman, defired to See me who-
had

They were greatly astonished to.fee Mr.Xovr//, and heartily congratulated him, while they were in Pain .for my Situation, and uSed all them Endeavours for my Recovery.

contrary Paffions.--This was indeed a
tender Scene : and our good Friends rejoiced in our Happinest.
In a short Space of I'ime, my Wonder was increased by Seeing Captain Stanley andshis Lady alSbenter : They Seemed to have an Idea of all that had passed, and expressed no Surprize at the Sight of Mr. LQvell Safe and in EnglanL
When the Raptures ocoafioned by this unexpeDed Meeting were Subfid'ed a little, I began to be dessrous of learning from the Mouth of my Lover the Particulars of his Preservation, and what had befallen him fince our last Separation, which, in Compliance with my Request, he thus related.

^ Being arrived, I was entertained at

Among ‘ the many Vifitors who frequented his ® HouSe, was a young Lady of high ^ Birth and great perfonal AccompliSh-‘ ments, and who would indeed have ‘ been the Admiration of all who knew ‘ her, but for her haughty Spirit, which ‘ more than counterbalanced all her ‘ Charms.
‘ Unhappily for, me, it fell out that ‘ this Lady regarded me with the Eyes
*	of Love, and was not a little piqued,
‘ wshen she obServed that I did not notice ‘ Several Advances which Slie made me.
“ At last, happening one Day to be left ‘ alone with me, she entered into a Con-‘ verSation on the SubjeD of Love^ and ‘ Marriage, in the CourSe of which file ‘ was indeed So explicit, that I could no ^ longer even affedi to mifunderstand ^ her.

‘ I chofe not to treat with apparent DiS-‘ dain one of So violent a Spirit; nor ‘ could I wiili to give Pain to one whoSe ' Misfortune., and not her Crime, it was to have entertained So fruitleSs a Paffion

‘ I took a middle Courfe; I acknow~
‘ lodged my Self, in gerieralAerms, high-' ‘ ly honoured by her Regard, and thofe ^ Marks of her Esteem, which my Cir-‘ cumstances would however by no Means ‘ capacitate me to return.
‘ This ReSpeD, as I have fince found,
‘ she misconstrued into Love, .and .after Some very oblip-ine; Speeches, withdrew ‘ for that Time.
‘ I afterwards wished I had enlarged ® more in my AnSwer: For meeting one ‘ Day with this Lady’s Uncle, Don Al~
‘ varez, on the public Walks, he enter-
*	ed into a long DiScourfe with me, in which he talked much concerning a
‘ Match

‘ Match between me and his Niece,

‘ relies, and become a good Catholic.
%
‘ It is eaSy to judge how much this ^ DiScourSe Surprized me : I hastened to ‘ undeceive the Don, who could Scarcely ‘ believe me fincere in my Declaration,
‘ and told me he took it ill that I should
‘ endeavour to hide from him what was

known to all Lijhon befide. But when ‘ I perfisted in my Denials, he grew Se-‘ rious, and at last downright angry:
“ Could you pitch (laid he) on none in Portugal befides the Niece of Don “ Aharez, to make your Sport of?

I communicated this Affair to Cap-® tain Stanley ;—he gave me to under-® stand that I had every Thing to fear ‘ from the ReSentment of Don Alvarez^
‘ who was a very powerful Man, and ^ one that was remarkably jealous of the ‘ Honour of his Family, as well as re--vengeful to the last, where he only ‘ Suppofed it injured,

Have you heard, Senna, the Story cS the Marriage of my^ uncouth Lover, and intended Ravisher, Cleyton f As there is Something odd in she Circumstances of the Affair, I will repeat it Lor your Entertainment.
He paid his Addresses for Some Time to a Widow who was reported to be very rich, whoSe ConSent at last he gained to a Match, of which he appeared very de-ssrous. Yet had not either of them the least Regard for the PerSon of the other, nor could the Figure of Cleyton be fup-poSed to command any : His Wife, although far from diSagreeable in her Per-fen, was extremeh'^ So in her Temper,.
