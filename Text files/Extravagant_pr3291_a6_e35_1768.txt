O D Y.
Mofl refpedlable Sir,
T a time, like this, when lite-

and protection.

iv DEDICATION.
t
No doubt, fotne will think my condudl extraordinary, and cenfure me for prefixing this Dedication :
Methinks
This
‘ is the flrangefi: whim ! The mofi: * ridiculous conceit! It were better ‘ he had dedicated to Every
Bony,
and then Somebody
‘ might have accepted it.’ But do thefe gentlemen forget the old
Every Body No-

adage^ _
bod y ; and that he who feeks to pleafe all, will feldom be liked by any ? Befides, nothing can be more proper than this addrefs from one whom Nobody knows, and, probably, Nobody cares for.
It
DEDICATION.
V
It is to You alone, then, reSped:-able Sir, that I muft commend my work, relying on your wonted goodnefs 5	You have always
been a friend to me and mine, and never failed me, at a pinch. Were I difpofed, like other dedicators, to give the public a detail of my patron’s virtues, I could fill a whole volume with Yours; but knowing that you have a very great averfion to flattery, I forbear, in compliment to your modefty; elfe might I enumerate a long train of ancient ^perfedions, and difinterefled virtues, which You inherit from
s
your anceftors, and which of late,
indeed, I believe Nobody has laid a jufl: claim to.
A 3
For
vi DEDICATION.
For my own poor part, I am proud to fay, that from You only,
of late, have I received any affift-
ance : when all my friends dropped from my fide, you generoufly flood by me ; and it is to You, alone, that
I owe, at prefent (under Heaven), my rank, as an Authorand my very exiftence, as a Man.
\

Accept then. Sir, this token of that refped: which (in gratitude) I am ever bound to fhew You and believe me to be, with great deference and refpeil,
SIR,
\
Your very obliged, and entirely devoted fervant.

One of this fort was Charles Clairville,

Efq-, whofe life is to be the Subjecl of the follov/ing fheets. So early as at the
age of five years, he loft his mother,
%
which was, indeed, to him the beginning of misfortunes. For his father-in-law, her fecond hufband, was a man of
a rugged temper, and moft invincible obftinacy, who looked on his fon rather as a piece of domeftic property, than as a rational being entrufted to his charge: his education, in confequence, he took no care of, farther than that, merely for
his ov/n credits fake, he fuffered him to go through fome of the ordinary forms at a public fchool j and on his return, as he never entertained any great affedUon

for him, and cared not Sor his company, he ever removed him, as much as poS*
fible, from- his fight, employing hiiil generally, as a Sort of affillant to his bai-
V
lifF; and whenever he, unavoidably, camie into his preSence, treated him with So
little tendernefs, that the youth was glad to Ihun him. By a ftrange and abfurd maxim, he w^as conilantly denied not only
^every little relaxation he was inclined to, but even curtailed of many of the necef-
faries of life.
Such a behaviour, unnatural and un-merited, often cauSed,Charles, whoSe temper, was very warm, to fly out into bitter
invedives againfl: his ftep-father, from whence Mr. Morley took as frequent occasions to repeat his ill ufage, and name thefe very circumftances, with many aggravations, as the caufes of his want of
tendernefs.
Hence

Hence aroSe hatred, diftruft, and a total eftrangement of every degree of love ' in his fon-in-law, together with the rife of that" extravagant .and careleSs temper which v/rought him perpetual unealinefs in the Subsequent Scenes of his life. Too true it is that, on the firft imprefiions le-ceived in early youth, the colour of our future temper generally depends. For being perpetually thwarted alike in all his delires, whether reaSonable or unrea-fonable, whether laudable or blameable, a fort of habitual carelelTnefs and indifference to every thing, but pleafure, fuc-
ceeded ; and he was reSolved to purSue liwhenever he found opportunity) with an equal eagerneSs, all his deSires, without

oS youth, and a levity of imagination, augmented the growing evil, and kindled in his bread; thofe embers which, in tirne, burd; out inta a flame So much the more fierce, and outrageous, by how much they had before been fmothered.
The fmall fortune of his deceaSed parent was left in trufl: to an uncle on his mother’s fide, who, on account of the ill LiSage his nephew received at home, of which he had, more than once, been a witneSs, had feveral times offered to take him under his proteflion; but Mr. Mor-ley as often oppoSed his deSign; till, at
lafl, the former, affuming the authority of a guardian, demanded what before he had intreated ; and the latter, not caring to make it a law-affair, conSented, though with great reluctance, to part with his charge.
'Whatever

Whatever, might be Mr. Motley’s reafbn for being thus unwilling to give up, to the guardianIhip of another, a hated relation, we fhall not, in this place, enquire into; Suffice it to fay, that Mr. Selby, his uncle, received him with
a real affedtion, and Seemed, in earneff, reSoIved to make up to him the lofs of

H U S releaSed from his bondage, our adventurer once more beean to

tade the Sweets of liberty, and experience the tender care of a relation. Mr. Selby was a widower about fifty, of a free,chear-ful diSpofition, a Social friend, and an
a
agreeable companion. Pie had one only daughter, who was called Emilia, and
at the age of fifteen, many charms of mind and perSon. She was of
the msiddling ftature, well fiiapec^ and of a graceful deportment. Her haif and eye-brows were of a dark brown j her eyes black and piercing *, her complexion fair as alabafter j her manner brific,

and lively, and her whole behaviour very engaging: yet was fhe of a turn ,ex-
ceedingly romantic, wild, and fond' of novelty.
Charles, whofe age was little Superior
to her own, was Struck with the figure of this agreeable female, and for the firfl: time entertained for her, in his boSom,
a paffion to which he Scarcely yet knew how to give a name ; nor was the young damSel inSenfible to the manly graces which already began to display them-felves in the youth, but felt, whenever fhe Saw him, an agreeable fenfation of
pleafure, yet So mixed with a conScious fear, as often cauSed a crimfon blufh to overfpread her face, which rendered her ftill more,lovely.

by her father, to pay his addrefles to her,
chiefly, indeed, on account of his wealth *, fince Mr. Selby, whoSe fortune
had Suffered greatly by embarking in the South Sea Scheme, together with our hero’s late father, was well aware that he had not a great deal to bellow with his
daughter in marriage ; but this her lover
was So eager in the purSuit of her for a millreSs, and was So much the darling of his father, that he could deny hiro' nothing ; So that Mr. Selby was given to underdand, that no terms would be infilled on, provided the match between the young couple could be concluded.
Such an offer was too advantageous to be rejedled; and her father, who never once dreamed of a courtfhip carrying on between his ward and daughter, did all in his power to perfnade her to accept it;

and, really, was not a little Surprized to find her averSe to the addrefles of the per-fon he had choSen for her. True it was, that he had not, indeed, all the accom-plilhments that appeared in Charles; but theSe, her father thought, might well be
diSpenfed with, considering the vail addition of wealth, and grand alliance
t
which the match would produce to their family. Meanwhile, his ward had absolutely made a declaration of his paffion to Emilia, and the young pair were far gone in love. But of this hereafter.
It may not be amifs, perhaps, in this place, to give the reader Some idea of the perfon and family of Charles’s rival, whom we flaall have occafion to make frequent and honourable mention of, in

Mr. Leonard Colville, or, as he was called, by way of eminence, young
’Squire Colville, was the Son of Sir Giles Colville, baronet, poirdTed of an
eftate of upwards of four thouSand pounds a year', in the moSt fruitful part of Kent. He was a tall, well-made youth, but of an afpedt and deportment rather fierce and forbidding, than winning and engaging. In his temper, he
was eager and obflinate, haughty and reServed ; lewd withal, yet had fo great a fhare of felf-love, that he generally took care not to bring himfelf into any disagreeable Situations by the'gratification of his pafiicns. Even Emily, whom he courted with eagernefs, he could not help fometimes.

and was perftiaded that he had baSe de-figns upon his daughter.
Prepoflelled with this notion, every a£lion of the youth necelSarily appeared to him in falSe colours-, and Charles Soon experienced an altered behaviour from his uncle, which was highly dif-pleafing to him eSpecially when he considered, that gratitude for his daughter’s
life preserved, ought rather to have influenced him in his favour.
At laft the ftorm, which had been So
long in gathering, burft over him; for Mr. Selby, having obServed him particularly familiar, one day, with his daughter, Sent for him into his clofet, and thus addrelTed him.
‘ Charles, you know I took you out

Charles drove, in vain, to clear him-Self from the charge alledged againd him j and his uncle proceeded to judgement. In fhort, he was told that, within three days, he mud quit the hoiiSe. This, to him, was a cruel Sentence; and,, to make it fall dill more heavy upon him, he found, that Emily was locked up in
her chamber, to prevent her converSing with him in the interim.
He found means, however, by corrupting one of the domedics, to get a letter delivered to the young lady, in
which he informed her of his uncle’s intention ; and, withal, offered to go off with her the very night before he was to

The reafon llie alledged was,, that Ibe Should then be more at liberty j and that She would take care, by means of the fame fervant who was in her intereft, to have the garden-gate left open.
Before Charles left Mr. Selby’s, that
gentleman caufed bills to be put into his hands, to the amount of all that had
been left him, which was about fifteen hundred pounds ; having taken proper

With theSe, and many other fuch arguments, the noble-minded maid dif-fuaded him from his purpofe ; and they parted in a manner as affeftionate as the
time and place would permit, vowing perpetual love.

But this was no time for dallying; and he was, at laft, perfuaded to make the bell of his . way homeward, having bound up his

This accident, however, occafioned

him to flay longer in the neighbourhood,
of his uncle’s feat, than he would otherwise have done, as he purpoSed to go, immediately, for London, his heart being
captivated with the description he had heard of that metropolis. As to, his
father-in-law, he had firmly reSolved never to fee him more j a refolution which it coft him but little pains to make.
Mean while, the people at the inn, where he lodged, were not a little inqui-fitive how he came to be wounded, and at Such a time of night (for he had been obliged to call them up for affiftance). Now as that part of the country was not
known

known to be inSefted with thieves, the affair appeared the more extraordinary *, and, it is probable, the good people would have carried their enquiries, on this head, much farther than they aftually did, had it not been for their fears of offending one whom (as they knew nothing of what had paffed at his uncle’s) they looked on as the adopted heir of Mr. Selby.
But that gentleman found means to
make enquiries, alfo, on his part, into
the affair; for the inftant he heard that

his nephew had been in a night-Ikirmifh, he began to fufpedt fomething of the

Emily was taxed with the affair, and though die was absolutely ignorant of the fight, yet expreffed So much concern, on hearing that her lover was wounded, and bluOied So much at the fight of the rope ladder, that her father entertained little doubt of her being acquainted with the whole buSineSs. He loaded her, therefore, with reproaches, which fhe little de-ferved; and reSolved to keep, her clofe priloner in her own aparrment, (the windows of which he cauSed to be fecured) till Mr. Colville, who was juft going to London, on Some buSineSs, Ihould return, and marry her. All her father’s arts, however, proved ineffeclual, to find out who it was that had engaged his nephew, though, as he fufpedled Colville to be the man, he had tried, by all means, to wind the Secret from him. Sometimes he complimented

In the interim, there was a young gentleman, among the many who vifited at this houSe, that frequently call his eyes on MiSs Aubrey, whom he admired much, and begged to be introduced to her company.

Firll, then, MiSs Mariana, the elder daughter of Mrs. Barclay, was a tall, well-made woman, but of an aSpedt rather forbidding; generally haughty, but more remarkably vain.

Accordingly, he Sent for him to the Temple Exchange coffee- houSe, where being arrived, with a heavy heart he diS-cloled his affairs to his fuppoSed friend.

He was defired, by his conduflor, to walk into a genteel apartment, and wait till his lady came down; who, in a few minutes, made her appearance.

But the time was now come, when this myftery was to be unravelled, which the lady prepared him for, by dropping hints of it, from time to time. At length, he perceived, one day, his pa-tronefs to put on a more fmilin^ countenance than he had ever obferved her to

In the evening, the marchioneSs deSired him to attend her in her cloSet; and,
when he came thither. She begged his ex-cuSe for quitting him a few moments. ‘ There are books,* Said Ihe, ‘ proper to

which Seemed to have been lately placed there.--"‘ In this place,’ Said fhe, ‘ flran-‘ ger, amidfl theSe horrors, I demand, ‘ that you Swear to keep Secret, whatever

and', for the time of this ftudy, he generally choSe the night; which, together with the number of books and papers that he kept, and a habit which he had

Mr. Clairville fitted olit for the Eaft Indies—Meets a good Friend, who prevents him from going,
H E next plan that our hero adopt-ed, and which was alfo propofed by this Mr. Millain, was that of enter-ing himfelf as a cadet in the Eaft India company’s Service. Nothing could be more agreeable to his romantic turn; he eagerly embraced the propofal: Mr. Mil-lain undertook to provide him with ne-
celTaries for the voyage, and the India
\
company themfelves always pay the paf-fage of the cadets they fend out.
This Millain was, indeed,, a true friend to him, and was; bent on doing him Service ; but either a ftrange fatality, or his
own imprudence, generally interpofed,

%
fiances, his imprudence became at once his crime and his punilhment.
_ Will, now vifitedJMLXdaLryille more frequently than before. He Scarcely ever miffed calling upon him morning and evening, and ‘ his circumflances grew ‘ worSe and worSe; nay, he had not fb ‘ much as a genteel fuit of cloaths to ‘ appear in j and he mufl wait on Lord ‘ Racket on Wednefday.—What fhould * he do?—‘ Why, go to Mr. Millain’s ‘ taylor with me,* laid Charles, and he ‘ fhaU credk-yotn’-is^-But would not that

Mofl: unfortunately, jufl: at the time
that Mr. Millain, who was going a little way into the country, put into Charles’s hand a bank note for thirty pounds, after having configned his chelts of things,
&c. to his 6wn proper care, left the Ship ftiould Sail without him, at that very time Will, wanted about twenty pounds upon

proteftations, it never came to the hands of the ownQr again. Nor was this all. Having given him an order upon Lord Racket (which the other took as full Security, though it was not really worth twenty pence) Charles fancying all Safe, began to indulge himfelf a little, and fuf-fered Will, to lead him, once more, amongft a feledt company of his old companions, where he met Mr. Sharpley, who very cordially fhook him by the hand, and declared that ‘ he was prodi-‘ gioufly glad to lee him;* which he proved, by winning about fix guineas

of his money from him, at cards: fo that, after all the expences of the night were anfwered, Charles did not find above three guineas remaining out of his thirty pounds. But what then ? Lord Racket was honourable, and his friend WiU. to be Sure, would not deceive him.
The next night he fuffered himfelf to be lured again to the gaming-table, where he loft his own money, and fix guineas
more, which he borrowed, and gave his
note for, on demand, to Sir William

When the feven days were expired, he
went to Lord Racket’s houfe, but his
lordihip was ftill in the country; and, what was more furprizing, his friend did
not call upon him, as uSual. There was a talk of the fhip’s failing foon, and
Charles
2i6 the happy extravagant.
Charles began to be uneaSy.—As one misfortune Seldom comes alone, though his friend had forgot to call on him, Sir William did not forget to call for his money, producing his own note, payable on demand. In order to take this up, and to Save his credit in other little affairs, he was obliged to borrow m.oney upon Some of his things, to the amount of ten pounds ten {hillings, when he loll the
remaining four pounds four {hillings, to-
%
gether with his watch, the very night cn-
Suing, in Covent Garden. The next morning, when he went to Seek for Will, he was informed, that he was juji ftepped over to Ireland, to tranSad Some
bufineSs for Mr. Sharpley; but would return in about a couple of months. At the fame time he received notice, that day being Friday, that the Eaft Indiaman, in which he was to embark (already at
Gravefend),

if the wind continued fair. This mef.
fage was accompanied by a card from Mr. Millain, then at the D---r’s, de-

Such a complication of mifchiefs allo-
nilhed and confounded him. He had.

loft his .money, pledged part of his cloaths, the reft were not Sufficient; and he could not bear to look Mr. Millain in the face. Moft imprudently, therefore, he raiSed what money he could upon his yet remaining things, and made a journey to B-----,

H A R L E S was in no hurry to

Mr. Millain had again left London, and was gone to reSide, for fome months,
with his friends at Wincheller, and was alSo afilired that the bond he had
given to the company had been taken
up, and could not appear againft him.
In a few weeks time he found his finances again reduced to the lowefl; ebb; and, beSides being totally out of employment, he had no one to adviSe with, and was absolutely on the brink of deSpairj
when, peruSing the papers one day, according to his uSual cuflom, he read the
following advertisement.

N
Charles, though he knew not where to get money to fit himfelf out with ne-ceflaries, had yet a ftrong propenfity to go, according to the direftions, and enquire for the agent. Accordingly, he did So. The agent Surveyed him, and
\
Seemed mightily pleaSed with his manner and behaviour. He ordered him to call again at a certain period, and, in the mean time, the advertisement was withheld.
When Mr. Clairville called to receive
his final anSwer, he laid before him the State
of
THE HAPPY EXTRAVAGANT. 221
of his affairs, who made no. Scruple of advancing him money to be laid out
in neceifaries; in which adion, indeed, it is probable, he did not go beyond his commiflion.
The place, of his deftination was Jamaica, and our adventurer, like all un-happy people, promifed himfelf much
felicity the moment he fhould turn his back upon his native land; the unfortunate, like the fick, being always fond of fhifting place. But how often do they deceive themfelves in their exped-ations ! while thoSe cares^ which hovered round their couch at home, climb, abroad, the veffel’s prow, nor leave them in the boundlefs ocean.

So.

doomed to wafte the prime of his youth, a prey to miSery, in a ftrange land.
He was Soon introduced to Mr. Bar-ton, who gave him to underftand that he was to be.his employer. This gentleman was about the age of fifty, of a very grave aSpe6t and lerious deportment. He was one whole Sole ftudy had been to a-mafs a vaft fortune by commerce, the

by a kind of irreSiflible impulSe. The

fibly could judge of his qualifications or the diSpoIition of his mind. She took
«	f
frequent opportunities of coming into the

of Seeing and converling with him, and #
whenever -his name was mentioned, her heart felt a palpitation which lovers only can account for. Though Charles had indeed often, during his voyage, lighed in remembrance of his Emily, yet now he Seemed again to have forgotten her j and MiSs Barton began to appear doubly amiable in his eyes; firfl, for the regard which fhe fhewed to him, and.

Already did he fancy himSelf poS-felfed of an immenSe fortune, and reclining on the lap of luxury ; but, to do him juftice, though wealth was what he principally aimed at, yet the perfon of Alicia would have been a very acceptable prefent to him, as flie really loved him, and poffelfed accomplilhments that might

One
of this claSs was Mr. Clairville, whole temper was So amorous, and withal So ardent and lively, that he was often mif-taken for a native of the warmer climes. Alicia, nurSed beneath the burning zone,.
was no leSs a favourite of the Paphian queen j. but Europe claimed her birth, as might be Seen by her complexion, which was clear as alabafter, though her cheek
v^as highly fluHied with the crimSun dye of beauty.
Mr. Barton would not have enjoyed a moment’s peace, could he have entertained the lead fuSpicion of an inclination in his daughter for the young European j but he reded in a Supine negligence as to this miatter, while the young couple, who had by this time been very explicit with

It was on one of the fine ftarlight evenings So common in the warm climates, that young Har-top was condudled through the garden-gate, where he was witnefs to an amorous conversation that pafifed between Charles and his Alicia, in a green arbour, where vows of love and conftancy were mutually given and received. While they were tenderly embracing each other, Mr. Hartop coming forwards, with eager cu-riofity to Survey what was hateful to his eyes. Humbled over a Hone, and by that accident discovered himfelf to his rival, who, perceiving that his adversary’s Sword was in his hand, drew a hanger from his boSom. Thus armed, he ruflied upon

1
Sharply upbraided Charles, who, inftead of endeavouring to eScape, had been all the time bulled in endeavouring to recover his miflrefs, and now Suffered him-felf to be Secured without making any

manner of refillance, while She was delivered to the care of her women.
Mr. Hartop, in the mean time, was fent home, and all proper care taken' of
him, and his antagonift detained till the iffue of the affair Ihould be known, and the death or recovery of his rival ascertained by the Surgeons who attended him.

Thus were all the fond hopes of our hero blalled by one miSadventure, while, inllead of the enjoyment of wealth and beauty, which he had imagined to be juft within his graSp, he found himfelf
obnoxious to the charge of murder, de-ferted by the few acquaintance he had made in the ifland, and liable to be tried for his life.

‘SIR,
‘ I am under fome concern that it has ‘ not yet been in my power to bring the ‘ affair between us to fome fort of eciair-« ciffement. I have been cautious, how-‘ ever, while yet the event was dubious, ‘ to do every thing that might contri-‘ bute to prevent any miSchief that might

In anSwer to this letter, which had all the appearance of a challenge, Charles fent a note importing that he would meet him at the time and place appointed, yet rather with a view of Settling the affair amicably, than of concluding it with another Scene of blood. Meanwhile, Mr. Barton Sent him back his articles, incloSed in a reproachful letter, adviSing him, in a Sarcaltic manner, tp return from whence

He was, however, obliged by con-trafl to pay the expences of Mr. Clair-villc’s paflage to England, in cafe of his diSmiffion within a certain limited time; but as there was a Ship ready to fail for the French Hand of Martinico, our adventurer was willing to Save that charge to his employer, and refolved to uSe all his endeavours to get recommended thither : for though he had not any delirc

Both the rivals met, and after much conversation palling concerning the occa-fion of their difference, the Weft-Indian Suffered himSelf to be appeaSed by the remonilrances of Charles, and his reSolu^

It was in the month of May that he Set forward on his voyage to Martinico, at which place he arrived in the uSual time, without meeting with any adventure worth noting in this hiftory •, and having fought
out the gentleman to whom his letters
were addrefled, Soon procured a recommendation to one M. de Martelle, a French merchant (as he underftood that language; to ferve him in the capacity of

Mr. Clairviile’s Sairiily, frequently vilited him there. As Madame Marteile was very fond of the Englifh nation, and curious in her enquiries concerning their cufloms

A treacherous domeftic, Seeking to ingratiate himSelf with his mailer, took this opportunity of infpiring him with a jealouSy of Mr. Sidney, intimating that that gentleman held a criminal correspondence with his wife, and that Charles was the pandar to their meetings.
Falfe and groundlefs as this alperfion was, yet it had but too much weight with M. de Marteile, who began to call about for means to difcover what, if it had been really true, muft have proved to him a perpetual Source of uneaSinefs.

them, and Such was the caSe before us* It was not long before the jealous hufband Surprized his lady in an innocent tete ct iete conversation with Mr. Sidney, Charles having juft ftepped out about Some bufi-nefs. This was enough for the Frenchman, blinded as he was by prejudice. He
defied Mr. Sidney, and rulhed upon him
*
in the moft outrageous manner;—they

fought, and the Servants came in between and parted them. He then attempted to ftab his wife •, but in this he was pre-vented by Mr, Clairville, who was returned by this time, and was aftonilhed
beyond meafure at the Scene he beheld.

Mr. Sidney pitied the blind frenzy of the erring man, and finding all attempts to undeceive him vain, recommended the unhappy lady to the care of her attendants,
\
and withdrew to his own houSe, where he

penned a letter, every way calculated to convince Martelle of his error, and Sent it to him.—The anSwer it produced was a challenge, and the affair might have

As for his vvife, he kept her cloSely confined to her chamber, till he could take methods for a formal Separation from her, which he was reSolved upon effe6l-ing'; So blind had prejudice made him to his real happineSs: and, this was the more extraordinary, as a jealous diSpoSition is far from being the charafleriftic of the French, who, on the contrary, are ge-

This was a place of great trull, as much of the current cafh palled daily

The truth was, that Seyton and another of the clerks, who hated him, had

laid this plot to ruin him.

About twelve, I could hear Nancy go-

Having done this, he went round, by way of the houfe into the garden, attended by a Servant, and taking with him a Sword and a dark lanthorn,
he Hopped behind the arbour, unnoticed

by the amorous pair. Thus Situated, he

overheard a great deal of their conversation j in the courSe of which it appeared that Colville had bound himSelf to make a handSome provifion for his paramour. ‘ But,’ Said he, ‘ I muft marry Emily,
‘ though her ill uSage has converted my

‘ love for her into .hatred For upon this ‘ very match my fortune muft, in a great ‘ meafure, depend, as my father is now ‘ become as eager for it as ever I mySelf ‘ was.’ After this, and much more dif-Courfe of the fame fort, they fell into a more amorous parley. In fhort, they were cloSe locked in each other’s embraces, when Mr. Selby discovered him-felf, and ftarted out from behind the jeS-famines ; at the fame time the Servant opening his lanthorn, the Sudden flood of light, which played upon their faces, and the unexpefted appearance alSo of one

carried the light, climbed the garden-wall, and made his eScape, But Nancy,
endeavouring to follow him, fell down, and was preSently Surrounded by the do-

the noiSe of the fire-arms, and who came

running towards the arbour. It is eafy to

You will naturally imagine, Mr. Clair-ville, ths^ his lordihip met with no favourable reception from me *, nay, I often treated him with a raillery which my fa-

Though I could

But his lordlhip, impatient of what he termed my colclneSs, had formed a Scheme to bring matters to a Speedy concluSion. He invited both my father and myfelf to a little pleaSure houSe of his, a few miles off, which vras newly built, in order, as

From that time I kept a very watchful

from hindering him in the purSuit of his

not care to refuSe him.
By his advice and afiiflance, I took the proper methods to make the knight give up the charge which he had abufcd. Then,finding mySelf at liberty to chuSe an-other guardian, I fixed on Mr. Bradley to
