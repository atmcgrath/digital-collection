In die purlieus of Covent-Garden, thou went in Search of modesty and virtue, and as thou didst not find them there, thou reaSon’dst thy Self into the belief of their non-existence. Tell me not, that thy opinion is formed from this or that woman being daily pointed 6iit to the cenSure of the public; thofe reports, calumny propogates ; for one really guilty, thousands are innocent. Thou hast no faith in the patriotism of Wilkes, and the abilities of lord North.—Are not that patriotism, and thoSe abilities as publicly Sworn to as the indiScreet

against them, had they not forcibly made me conScious of my folly and their worthiness.

LETTER IV.
' I H O U hadst not leSt OxSord three ^ months, when a letter I received from my father, plunged me into real miSery, and from the happiest of the thoughtleSs Oxonians, made me the most anxious of all the rational beings. The loSs of two strips richly loaded, which had been taken by a French
I
privateer off Cape Finisterre, reduced him to the utmost indigence.—He had but time to write the fatal news, as the fear of his creditors compelled him to
9
sty immediately to Holland.—“ I have no money to Send you, added he, nor
can
f. >3 ]
can I provide Sor your future Support— you have knowledge and wit—there
are opulent fools in England—your Sate is in your own hand ; it will be your
Sauk if it is unhappy.—Pleafe or be ufeful'i if you poffeSs either ot thoSe advantages you need no other—without them, be ever So virtuous or learned, you shall languish your fife avray, the Scorn of mankind.’'
\
Had my father’s advice been accompanied by a purSe of gold, I might have
ventured to London in Search of the
• >
fools he Spoke of.—But poor and friend-leSs—be not angry Francis; I know
I
thou wouldst have taken me to thy bo-Som, and made me share in thy wealth, had I acquainted thee with my distreSs. In the first stutter of my Spirits, I did -	'	not
t 14 ]
i
not think oS thee, and when friendship revived thee in my memory, love struck me Silenti
Pride Suffering me not to stay* at Oxford till my disaster should mark me out an objedt of pity, I Set off the next day on foot for London. The natural careleffneSs of my temper diS-
fipated gradually the gloomy thoughts which had crowded into my mind;
I laughed at an evil which
It was
not in my power to avoid. Hope and philosophy Supported my courage, and Spread flowers upon the road I walked. The third day of my journey, as I was crossing Hyde-park, I Saw at Some distance a throng of men -and horSes. Alking for the caule, I was told it was a Sale of Some of the most beautiful
ui
hunters
\
t >5 I
hunters in England.
Thou knewest
Francis, that I have studied horSes more than Greek and Latin, and that I w^as renowned Sor my knowledge oS their beauties and deSedts. CurioSity brought me to the place, where, at the first Sight, I could not help admiring the hunters. They had Such a Sorm, Such a life, as made me envy a noble lord who intended to purchaSe them. The affedlation of the jockey, in keeping unneceffarily the horSes in a perpetual
movement, made me fuSpicious. I ob-ierved with the eye of Self interest, and Soon discovered a weak nest in the left hinder leg of one of the hunters, which the art of his rider had Secreted from the fpedlators. Angry at the deceit, the villain defigned to put upon the nobleman, I drew nearer his lordship,
and

i6 i
and when he offered three hundred gui* neas for the lame hunter, 1 cried aloud, that the horSe was not worth forty-. Not worth'' forty ! exclaimed almost every perSon preSent; and they looked upon me with the fupercilious Smile of con-tempt. No, not worth forty, anSwered I boldly. The horSe courSer, damning me and my judgment, deSired Some of his friends to duck me in the Serpen^ tine river. His defire they chearfully undertook to gratify. I was nigh being the viftim of . my honesty, when
----, who in the mean time had
lord C
peruSed me from head to foot, humanely interpoSed in my favour, and Saved me from the rage of the disappointed sharpers. His lordship took

had made, and begged his lordship’s

4
assurance, must I tell it you ?—My bu-SineSs is to Sell; yours is to know what you buy. Were it not for lucky casualties, who would undergo the fatigues of any trade whatever, and be the stave of the public ? Though his lordship Seem--

I had not been a week in mjy place, before I perceived that the counteSs looked upon me rather as a Spy over her behaviour, than as a man devoted

Hence it happens that a really virtuous woman is often, from the coquet-try of her manner, mistaken for a voluptuary, whilst the drapery of decency ranks the voluptuary among the devotees to virtue. A hushand is Seldom beforehand with the public in the Secret of his wife’s intrigues. If the public is impoSed upon, there is ten to one-that the hushand lhall not know his disgrace ; or that if he knows it, he will not dare to complain through the fear of not being believed.

Some qualm of conscience, and of the fear of being understood, I gave a gayer turn to the conversation, and told his lordship the judgment most of nay friends had formed of the women.

of the fair, is only an air, which they assume, either to comply with fashions, or keep alive, the affedlions of the men they esteem. That levity has no influence over their morals, totally independent of the external form they think proper to affume. None but fools will judge of the virtue of the women from their dreSs, gesture and conversation: ThoSe fancy or opinion dilates, and have no other tendency than to Set off the charms they poffeSs, and make them more conSpicuoussy graceful and lovely. Believe me. Rambler, I have, in the Spring of my life frequented the-comrpany of the women, and foupd, af-

A few minutes after, being told that th^ carriage was at the door, she foUewed my valet de chambre. Surprised at my not following her, and at thp order given to the postilions to Set our, and take the road to London, she called to them to stop.

S Emily had rode above three ] hours in the dark the night be-Sore, I was in hopes that she would not ] perceive the deceit put upon her ; but ; an unlucky post erefted in a croSs way betrayed me.

John Rambler, ESq; to Sir Francis
Croslev.

H E N lord W
finilhed the moving hido
m
ry of the diSgraceful part, v:hich pashon had forced him to adl, I involuntarily exclaimed------
My lord, you have been more lucky than wiSe.’'
VoL. II

His
C 2 ]
His lordship Smiled.
CC
I own. Rambler, that I have been
very inconfiderate : but, of my adions
which do you blame the most ?
CC
Your attempt against MiSs Clin-
ton’s honour.
“ You are right; for had I been Suc-
eeSsful, I might not have had the ge-
neroSity to be just to Emily. ' Grati-
tude, Rambler, Seldom follows enjoy-
ment—the woman who has made us
happy, is too often, like a troubleSome
creditor, the objed of our averfion.
The vaineneSs of my attempt has en-
deared Emily to me—now, I know her
worth; before, I was uncertain of it
her
(
\
[ 3 ]
her behaviour has proved her virtue beyond the power of words.—

\ '
“ The odds were So much against her, my lord! A woman—a tender woman in the circumstance you have So feelingly related—she triumphed! I congratulate you upon her vidory.

I have, as you Said, Rambler,
been more lucky than wiSe.
“ After Such a trial, my lord, you may boast a virtuous wife.-----
“ The woman who has not been tempted, is hardly praiSe worthy
Her virtue has no more reality than the honesty of a man, whom avarice, hat-
B 2
red.
[	4 ]
red, or ambition, never incited to b
baSe.
‘‘ Except thoSe, whom age, stupi-dity, or extreme uglineSs Secure against
the ssattery of men, what woman has not every day her own deSires to Subdue, or a powerful tempter to relist ?
“ Temptation, Rambler, has more or leSs power according to the degree of our SenSibility. DeSire does not So forcibly actuate one woman, as it does another—that difference is the thermometer of my esteem of female honour. I reSpedt the woman, whoSe behaviour declares her modesty; but I com-mend that only, who, under the de-Ibotic Svray of love, or of the want of
^	'	i
pleaSure, continues a faithful devotee
y
to

[ 5 1
to virtue—the Sormer is indebted to
k
indifference for the regularity of her condud—the latter to the SenSe of her duty.

I .
“ I am afraid, my lord, many are not the women of that charader.—-—•
“ Judge of their number from the few, who are openly charged with li-bertinifm.
/

Discretion, my lord, may Save thousands from fiaader.—-—
“ An English woman has no art.
Rambler ; in her motions or upon her
features, are marked the passions of her heart." ■ i	i.''»
“ I would

With eourtiers, not with lovers^
Rambler.
“Was you not deceived by the ca^
reffes of Emily r
?
(C
Self-love, I own, betrayed me int^
a foolish credulity.
“ Who is free of Self-love how often does it not bid reafon away, and form our judgments ?—Oh ! my lord, it is not So eaSy to read woman ! would I shad the key of her heart! ‘ who has it ? nobody.

A Servant coming to let us know that
lord C
waited for us, we hast-
ened to the inn.
On our entering the
room where his lordship was with Emily, he took her by. the hand, and casting a glance oS indignation at his ne-phew———
“ There, Emily, is the man, whoSe
I
tongue, fince he leSt London, has not
uttered one word of truth—who at his
$
looks would not take him for a man of honour ^—Come here, fir, fall on your
knees before this injured beauty-------
at what School did you learn to be
falSe ?-----
“ At the School of necessity, my
lord.

That necessity was your own work you are doubly criminal—Emily, for-
give him not
let him first prove him-Self worthy of your pardon—make him buy it by fix months of Sorrow—it is in your power to punish.-
For that very reaSon I must forgive—your kindneSs to me forces me to forget his wrongs.
Ci
You may repent your generofity
Emily.
“ She never shall, my lord; I am Sincerely Sorry for the past——the behaviour of the hushand will compensate for that of the lover.—Your virtues
V
and thoSe of Emily, stxall become my:
'	own

r 9 1
own—It v*?ill be my Sole study to de Serve her love, and your esteem.
You believe him, Emily :
?
“ I do, my lord.
V
“ So guilty, and yet So readily ac-quitted!—I shall not have her indulgence—you have too wantonly trissed with Emily’s happineSs, not to Suffer for it—
\
—^she shall not be your wife till
I am convinced-that passion only lead
/
you astray—My reSpeft for her bids me to be Severe—your condud, and not vour words will I credit—if in a month
J
I have no doubts of your probity, Emi-
V
ly shall be yours,—-----

[ lo ]
“ My lord, repeal your Sentence, or I shall be the most miserable ©f men a month! Such a punishment Sor a fault, which it Seems, a propitious God
9
made me commit, that Emily and I
r
might be happy !—You rather should reward me for a fault, which gives you
an opportunity of obliging
against
me only will you be the reverSe of your-
«
Self —I know that the delay of iriy happinefs will be a torment to you for your own Sake repeal your Sentence you Smile-----------1 am forgiven.
iC
No more of that chattering non-
SenSe—let us have Some refreshment
The month, dear Emily, will dwindle into a week—that week will
be an age to my impatient Soul-----
your
c II j
your good nature has added to your beaiSty and my love--------let me thank
you

And he thanked her upon her lips.

The presence of the waiters put an end to his gratitude, and the blushes oS Emily. After a light repast, a post
coach was ordered, and we Set out for

Sorrow clouded immediately the
brow of lord C
he took me in

I experienced that it is not Safe to feign a passion for a fine woman, and tell her of it. Her Smiles and caresses Set
Soon our SenSes on fire : whilst their fe-

I T H me, Mrs., Query discarded her borrowed charadter,
and aiTumed her own : I Saw neither the prude, nor the coquette. Convinced of the Sincerity of my affeclion, she: frankly laid her heart open before me, that I might exult at the diScovery o£ its feelings. Her noble behaviour made a deeper impreffion upon me than her beauty had done. I beheld her with reSpecl and admiration, and at last with'
put diSguife, perfonated the lover.
‘‘ This

This woman! laid I to niySelf, is too real an enemy to dissimulation, not to be stridly virtuous. HypocriSy is^ the Spring of every vice in the female

LETTER XXL
AR Srom being diSpleaSed, I rejoiced, Francis, at my disappointments—my heart exulted in my diS-grace—I welcomed truth, and SorSook my errors. The wretch, who unexpectedly finds a treaSure at the Soot of a tree, to a branch oS which he had already Sastened the fatal instrument of his death, is not half So happy as I was at my being forcibly reclaimed from
my
t 202 ]
my prejudices. Convinced, from the tnals I had made, that the dissipated life of a woman of fashion, though contrary to good manners, is not incompatible with virtue, I reSpedted them the more, that the cenSure of the public was added to the innumerable temptations they were Surrounded with. When the virtuous are openly classed among the vicious, they are robbed
of their best weapon of defence
I
know the human heart

11 is leSs
to religion than to the esteem of the
-------Is
world we Sacrifice our paffions—--------
that esteem deferved and not obtained, it is to be feared that nature will comrnand and be obeyed.

winter feaSon, I had the following bil-

Mr. Rambler has frequented JVhitd.s,y and not only lost his fortune at hazard, but contra(5ted' confiderable debts, which he has not in his power to pay: in a few*
