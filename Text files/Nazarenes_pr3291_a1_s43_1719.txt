Jfferters of ths Na^arene Law : Among the rest, none Seems to have a more stridt Megard to the Mfe and DoBrine of the Tiiighty Twj&^Ti?r, hiS’ Ma than this prefent Prince, who now ffourishes and reigns in the Hearts of all his Subjeds.
As he has had alT the Advantage of Birth and Education, To Providence tn-dow’d him with a Soul capable of attaining to all that’s Good mdi Great,
And whereas the Dregs of the World, whofe Eyes are too weak to bear the Lu»i fire of his Vertues, have been vilely and' malitioufly excited to fling their Pari^ Scuin- at his Royal R erf on and Family^ yet the more penetrating and judicious Part of Mankindj take delight in contemplating the many noble Excellencies, and Bleflings they share in that Part of the
Adm'mtftration ho has over them.
PAnd tho’ Some Princes before him, have:
been So weak, as to Suffer their Creatures to push ’em upon fatal Meafures, yet we fee in him, Such an	against Ar^
J hitrary and Defpotick Power., that it is as-
an Article of Faith with him. That Prin^ ces ought to have the tendered Regard io the Coftfcie'MAs of their SubjeBs, And that it is a Mifchief, attended with, the meji fatal CmfeqiienceSy < to‘ ahife their'

lower^ and break'in ufon the Rights of their People*—'
Maxims^ tsot only founded upon Rea^ fon, the equitable Law of lIature, but even revealed Religion it Self which can lead no Prince astray ty but rathef fwell his Monarchy to the utmost Limits : When, on the other-hand, we have Seen, that an excessive Rigour, ufed without Caufe, has been very unfuccefs-^ ful to fovtit Princes ^ for, by its alienating the Hearts of the People, they have grown Weary under their Government,*and once wifely) by a general Gonfent, reSoL ved to cnoofe themfelves better Masters. Nay, it has had fuch an tsW Tendency^
( ifit may be fb call’d) that they have Seen apt to affert, Eot only a Right of Chustng thednfelves a Sovereign, but^ like--wife, a Right to Divest him of that Pow^ #>, in cafe he makes an ill life of it.—
But as the Validity of this Contfoverjy, is none of our Province to decide, we shall wave it, and only Say, That when Princes expoSe themfelves to tMs y uSe their Subjeds as if they were brute Beasts ^ and, without Scruple, violate the mbst invio-Mble and Sacred Rights, they run a very nice Hazard of lofing Jll •, which cart
only be regain’d, but by Blood and Slaugh^
ter <
ter; and that too, very Seldom, thro’ th Averfion their Subjeds have to Defpotk Power * especially it> thoSe who have
Right to exped; that, their Sovereign should Submit to the Laws^. which mu tually engage them one to another.
But, left the Reader should obServe bi this Digreffion, that
f’
Subjed:, we will return to the Charade of the Nazarene Prince : And as, we on ly defign to give a short Account of hi molt important Adions, we will flip o-yer thofe of his youthful Years, and com immediately to Speak of him at his en tring upon the Administration of a Sove reign Prince.
As Soon as he held the Reins of Go
»• . /
verntnent., he betook himSelf to a ftrk Application, in order to the inriching hi Subjeds y and show’d himSelf very libe ral, and of a tender and gentle Nature He has a great and generous Soul, witi as much Solid Wit as any Prince in thi
Age ^ both Friends and Enemies ackriow ledge it, by doing him Justice herein.
P V" As to his Htmour/n is generally Grave K; ‘ and attrading, ( as his 4/^6'^ J but free
and eafy of Accefs y which finishes th. Number of thofe Talents peculiar to ;
Monarch.	. ■.
. S.5 )
Tbcfe Qualifications, of themfelves, aye fufficient to render him Compleat^ but there are yet still greater to come. He is iadmir’d by all the World, for his Firm-nefs of Courage, which cannot be Sufficiently esteem’d *, the GreatneSs of his Heart, andstie Dependance he has upon the Astistance of the Emperor his Mafier^ wlioSe Faith he defends, buoys him up, and protests him against all the Rage of the heathen World. His Majler had a treacherous Minister, that bore an eminent .post under him ^ his Vice-roy^has had many of the fame Spirit, whole fatal En -terprizes might even make ’em Wish,Ti?/?^ a Miljlone were tfd about their IIecks^ and that they were thrown into the Sea, So that it may be Said of him, as of the Palm-Tree^ the more it is burthen’d, the liiorc it raiSes its Head, and fiourishes.
As to martial Affairs^ he has approv’d himSelf an experienc’d General, when in the Field j not followingbn the one hand, the Example of thofe who steep at their Eafe on Beds of Down, whilst their braver Soldiers expoSe their Lives for their Interests, and are over-whelm’d with Fatigue and Hardship : nor given in to the stovenly Meanneffes of others, whole def-jjerate, ( or rather mad ) Exploits, in the

To proceed* There is Such a Senfe of
-Gratitude in him, that he never fuffers a-fine Adipn to go unrewarded. So that it’s no Flattery to affirm, that he has distinguish’d himSclf Sublimely among the princes of this Age. ,
He is not only Master of most; languages, but has read much, and retain’d it all ^ and understands the Excellency and UfefulneSs of Authors extremely* There is no Secret in PhilofopJt^, el-ther Antient or Modern, but what he has penetrated ^ and more particularly

,, And as for this Prince’s Lineage, in general, we find, by the Several Gened--iogies in History, that he claims a lineal DeScent as a Sovereign Prince, for above Seven Hundred Years 5 the Family ha-, viog produced Several Emperors and Em-preffes, bestdes a long Train of Kings and Princes : So that even most of the Potentates of Europe.^ are deScended froni this Family •, bestdes an eiiiinent Tribe oiEcclefiali icks., as Arch-Bishops, Bishops,;
Spiritual Princes.
In short, this Prince of the Natdarenesi is the more Illustrious, in that there runs thro’Jiis Veins, not only the Britifi Blood, but that of France^ the antient PiBs^
Danes, Swedes, Saxons,and Eormans.
So that he exceeds all the Sovereigns on Earth, for the Antiquity of his Royal Defcent, being now the most Potent, and Opulent Affertor of the Na^anne Doarine.
And that the Sed of the Nazarenes. iaight be Secur’d from JpoJtatiz,ing into their former State of Pfeudo-Worfiip, fy-nonombtis with the Pradice of Pagans,; providence has given this Prince, a nuine-: fous Iffue, well Educated, and Instruded in the new Laws and Ordinances of their

Jian "Patriarchsy whoSe Expedationsare beyond Alps, can never have it in thcii Power, to Saddle their Princes, and ride ’em to Destudion as they have done formerly.
. I have Seen amongst the most nicest Pictures in this Prince’s Court, ah Origina Piece representing one of the Branches oi his Family, a most accomplish’dj-and brave Prince, yet the implicitness of his Faith, and the freeneSsof his Nature, once funl him into So much Submiffion to the Muft at Rome, as to hold the Cup to him on< Pay at .Dinner, So long on his Knee befon he took it, that the crimSon Retinue abou him, were asham’d of his treating So grea a Prinre in that manner *, telling hiti that it was time he should take the Cu] and'drink. —
, But instead of conipenSating for this AS front, his Spiritual Arrogance, continuet a greater Piece of Ingratitude towards hin in the following History of it.
This Prince SuSpeding he should hav ” ISfue by his Queen, perSuaded her t« ” adopt a certain Coufin of his/ and mar ry his Neice. Which was no Soone done, but the Mufti perSuaded him t ** a Disobedience, and the highest Ingra utude, and excited him to rebel aghinl
hi
( 8 )
■** his adopted Parents * upon which, they ” justly took up Arms against him, and befieg’d him in a strong ForrreSs notSar from Rome. But the SucceSs was very unfortunate •, for by a barbarous Srrata-gem, the adopted Son^ brib’d an aid ” Soldier, in whom the King and Queen ” had confided, to counterfiet her ** Seal, whom his Party had invested ” in another FortreSs ^ and in her Name, ” to write to the King, that with Six of his Confidents, he should come to her ^ by a private Avenue nam’d in her Let-’’ ter *, otherwise she must Surrender and fall into the Hands of her Enemies but that she had Something to propoSe to ’’ him, that would baffle their Defigns. ” The King believing the Letter real, follow’d the Instrudions in it, and Set ” out accordingly^ but was intercepted ” by a Party in Ambufeade, and carry*d ’’ before his adopted Son, who put him ” in Prifon for three Years. During ’f which time, his unhappy ^Queen was ” taken and pu^t to Death. --—
The preserving of this Piece in the Nar t^arene Family, must certainly excite ’em to a very profound Regard to the preSent Mufti^ who has labour’d h^rd to gi

(5)
st Specimen ofthegood Will be bears them : And stis the rather inferred here, that the Reader may recoiled what fatal ConSe-quences have attended the Counterfeiting the Seals of Princes, at the Instigation of the Mttfti oi Romey informer Days.
No doubt, but the preSent Prince of the Nax>annes had an Eve upon this
Pidure, when the E—--------of C—
was stir’d up by the Muftiy to perSecutd the peaceable Eazarenes in his Territories 1 and induced him to fend his vete-^ •
ran Troops into the E---------*s Capital
City, to malcc the Muftih Dragoon, keep to the Solemn Treaties he had agreed to, in relation to the Spiritual Affairs of his ^ubjeds.
And notwithstanding, this Bully stomach’d the Condud of the Nazarene Prince,’tis certain he could find no Expedient to prevent it. All that he could do, after repeated Advices from the Mufti, was to draw up a tedious and abSur’d Remonstrance of his Grievances, which he laid before the Grand Cahjtl of Princes.
But this Remonjirance was Soon filenc’d by a Mamfejfo from the Prince. Fof when it was brought into Debate, in a full Congrefs, the E------’s own Crea-
tures could not justify thofe wholfome Se^

The persecuting Conqueror having thus
gain’d his Point ^ he took Such cruel Methods with the distreffed Nazaunes^ that perhaps the like was never known*
First then, he Seiz’d the chiefest of the Nobility in the Kingdom, and put them into. PriSon. Then on a fatal Day, af-stgn’d to ad this Tragedy, a Piece of Ordnance was discharg’d, which was to be the Signal of it. As Soon as it was heard, all the Gates of the City were shut, and the Persecutor’s Forces took Poffeffion of them, and of most parts of the City.
, When they found theraSelves in a Condition to undertake any thing without Fear, a Scaffold was ereded in an open place, upon which mounted a tall Man all in Black, whth a MaSque upon his Face, and a Crucifix in his Hand. Thev gave him the fatal Name of Herald of

Among the rest of his Admirers, were thefe two Turks, who engaging in the very nejst Line, had obferv’d his Bravery, and kept a very watchful Eye upon him. They fav/ that what Some of their Officers could ncrt do honourably, they were baSely contriving with Some falSe fenesy to do by Treachery. They faw . him mounted on Heaps of flaughter’d SpahPs, making his Way thro* Blood y and with Horror perceiv’d the runagade Astastins at the very Minute they were going to execute their hellish IfcaSon

own to you, that in the beginning of oiiif Union, her Ladyship pay’d me all the Devoirs, to which it engagessthofe who know the Obligations of it y and that I thought tny Self belov’d by her with all the faith-fuineSs imaginable. I anSwer’d her Esteem,

So that we liv’d happy at that time*, and Heaven, who Saw our Intelligence, shew’d that he approv’d of it, by bleshng our Marriage. We had in the first Years Several Children*,- and, I did not doubt, but that my SpouSe, feeing that I made her Mother of a Youth, that promis’d all that could be expeded from Us,, would yet strcighten thoSe Bonds clofer which engag’d him to me. But,;alas! I wa&strangely mistaken, for in a few Years, I began tb perceive, that my Spoufe was tyr’d when we were by our Selves *, and that she had no longer that Air, and indearing ASped which I ufually beheld in her.

I imagin’d, that this GoldneSs would Soon be over, and that by a due Care, and strict Penetration, I Ihould be able to triumph over any Injustice that should invade me. But, I found, to my misfortune, that I was mistaken •, and I was but too well convinc’d of it, by an Adventure, •- which pierc’d ray Hearty whereof I am constrain’d to give you, Sir, a particular Relation.
You know. Sir, that It is a custom ar inong PerSons of Quality, to give one a-nother a l^ew-years .Gift, on Sew-years-day. I thought I should oblige my Lady, by making her a PreSent at that time. I chofe to that end, one of the finest and confidcrablc Jewels I had, which, with a Complement Suitable to the Occafion, I caus’d to be prefented to her. But the Lady, your Daughter, receiv’d it with a diSeoatented Air, and told me in a haughty manner,. That / mi^ht have fpaPJ that

hy Per already. And to add an xAffront to ber PiSdain, that very Day flie giveaway that fine PreSent, to a Young Nobleman, who had Merit enough in him to deServe it, had he not made ill USe of thofe generous Entertainments I gave him in my Family;
But, as iny Lord, it was Some Time before I knew of this Affront, which touched me fo nearly*, yet, I must confefsto you, that to eafe my Self, I was willing to impart my Uneafinefs to Some Perfon I could confide in; To that end, 1 unhappily took for my Confident, that perfidious Nobleman just before-mention’d, who (as I have fince reafon to believe) was the Gaufe of my Misfortunes, as I will tell you in a moment. For, when he perceiT ved that I had made fiira Master of all my Secrets, he at first feem’d to Sympathize with me, as a Friend*, and when I faw him thus Concern’d, 1 afk'd his Advice what to do on that Occafion, He anSwer’di
Sir,yoii are prudent: But^ had I a Wife that us'd me thus^ I could hardly forgive her ^ and I jhould hegin^ by refufing her all the Endearments fie might expeH from me.

You must, my Lord, acknowledge, ai Man to be of an uncommon Temper, to Support himSclf under all this — And, therefore, I prefume, you will not Blame me, if I kept a very watchful Eye upon the Conduct of Madam —, Your Daughter : Not but that I had the Command 0f my Temper So far, as to Conceal my Refentments, from my falfe Confident.
• At first I was refolv’d to take no Notice of this Indifcrction^ but my Pashon became too violent to hinder me from going to her Apartments, where, with Looks that beSpoke Something of Justice in my Demand, I afk’d her for the Jewel I had jiung away upon her as a New-Years Gift* The Shock she was under, to hear me afk it in Such Terms, rais’d in her Face Such Arguments of Guilt, that she had not Power to make any other Reply, Thatt
that it might be loft for what Jbe knew»

Thus, Sir, you may perceive that I deal Tairly with your Lordfhip *, but you will , more confpicuoufiy See, that theSe are all Forgeries of your Daughter, proceeding from her own Guilt, when, after having • repeated So many Fallities *, for, ’tis pi lin, that the Young Lady Slie there pretends to Say was my Mistrefs, had not been in the Family, for fix Months before the Tirrie of her forging the Letter your unhappy Daughter infinuates I writ to her.
Nay, Madam, the M----------s of------- cm
WitneSs for her, who is her Aunt, that she was all that Time, during this fictitious Plan was forming, at one of your Coun-itry Seats, 15 Leagues from the Capital of thefe Territories, and where I never was but once, and that Some Years (ince.
But there will need no farther Apology •for ray own Conduct in this Affair *, when, after having had Several Children, by Ma« ^ ^ dam, your Daughter, whom I LovM in;-tirely, the World, with your Lordfliip, will be perfwaded to my fide, when t come to tell you, what ray own Eyes were WitneSs to; and which, if well weigh’d, will strike with Amazement the inquifi-tive World.—— And thus it comes on.
There was an Appointment made in
my Family, to go and Spend the Suoime-r,
H 2	at

( 58 )
at the pleafant Town of /L-—to which-I agreed, and went thither, with tny Spoufe^ and a Splendid Retinue: where I met with ^ great Concourfe of Perfons of Diftinc^ tion ; the most eminent of which, 1 invL ted one Day,to a costly Entertainment; but I had very much reafon 10 Repent of this Treat, not So much for the Profufenefs of it, but for the Affront my Spoufc put up^ on me, in the prefence of them all. As
ike was very richly DreSs’d, (perhaps,
with more Gaiety, than ufually becomes a Mother of Children^ I chanced to lay my Hand on her naked Bofome, for which, file gave me Such a disdainful Look, accompanied with Such haughty Exprestions, shat the Company could not but obferve, by my Looks, but that my Refenrments
were proportional to the Affront.
But this is a trivial Matter: I stiall not conceal the most Important from you :—^ i had not fhar’d above half the Summer’s Diversion at this fine Place, but my Bust-call’d me home. ’Twas my Inclina-sion the whole Family fhould do the like s But, Madam, your Daughter, was pleas’d so take the Freedom to stay there Ibme Time after me. She knew that it would not pleafe me. And, iiideed, Slie behav’d berfeif in fo high a manner, that I was i . .	pity’d
\
( 59 )

pityM by all thoSe who knew the Sequel 'of our Differences.
However, having altnoft Spent the Summer, after Several Orders for her to comfe Home. —- She Sent me Anfwers in fudi a Strain, that they were the naoft provo^ king that could come from a Wife,— One
was, Thdt fie was not jo indifcreety hut [be. tould tell when her Ajfairs reauiPd her. Another, That [he knew well enough what Felkity waSy lime [he had no Controller at her Count*
trj-Setttri A Third, That [he knew Titm was flitting^ and that fie was not fo had a F-egifler^ but ah at fie could tell how long the
Seafon would permit her to Jlay :------ With
other like undutiful Expreilions, not fiu ting for a Husband to bear.--------
Upon this,I Sent my pofitive Commands
for her to return in a fix’d Time; and, that 1 might not flight Some private Intelligence I had gain’d from one, who was always near her, I went Incognito, to observe her Behaviour: -—— And here, with Grief, Horror, and Shame, my Lord, I come to draw the fatal Scene! Be it known to you, therefore, that having Intelligence, that fhe had admitted into her Chamber, a Stranger, I had no longer Patience, but, fir’d With Refentment, I took two of my Domefticksj and, bursting open the Door,
rush’d

I

( go )
in upon her, when I found them 0ttirig together, with a familiarity no way agreeable to any but .Husband and
p/ik. \	^	■
Here Patience, immediately took its flight, and abandon’d me to the most aggravated Paflian a Man coiild bear; and to act as Rage and Fury prompted me: ^ So that having a Pistol in my Hand, I
flr’d it at the Author of my Misfortunes, fast as he was leaping into a Mote which furrounded the HouSe.
Whether or no, the Pistol did any Execution, I cannot as yet tell; but true it is, the Ravifher has never been heard of fincei And, now my Lord, does not this fata! Intrigue merit the highest Refentment? Certainly, you will not Blame me, that, after this Action, I gave Orders that your Daughter Should be confin’d to her Chamber, W'irh a Maid or two, and that all my Servants, (hould stridly watch her Apart-
inents, ’till I knew your Lordfbip’s Plea-
fure.
’ But, my Lord, my Spoufe having now dme to recriminate her falSe Conduct, and flnding her Self So narrowly obferv’d, that tier Spies were uneaSy to her^ She wrote the following Letter.
