stered with novels.
At a time when there is So great
a dearth of good writers, it is almost needlefs to Say any thing in favour of the following work. The town lias long been pe The vitiated taste of youth, owing to the peruSal of fuch produdlions, is an undeniable proof of the great neceflity of exploding the publication of all fimi-
lar works, which 'most deierveeuy Hif— rits to be configned to eternal obli-
vion.
The adventurers of an imaginary being is generally the
theme of
thefe writings : An abandoned female, a profligate rake, or a reformed de-
£
bauchee, the principal events of whoS life are treated of in books of this
fort
(
iv
\
)
ort are the general topic; thefe arc
daily offered to the peruSal of the idle
and diffipated, and the minds of young
people are corrupted by that which \
ought to
be the Source of inffrudtioii
X
and entertainment. They either be-
come acquainted with Scenes of intrigue
and wickednefs to which they were be-
fore utter strangers, or, which is e-
'’S
ct
bad, their minds are filled
quaily
with ideas of incidents as impropable
abfurd. Thus the origi-
o c
they
'^re

nal defign of novels is entirely perver-
ted.- They were at first intended to
instrucst, at the fame time that they
amufe the reader; but alas! the state
of virtue is become So degenerate, that
nothino: is favourably received but what
o
tec
ms with obScenity of language and
profligacy of fentiment. To this caufe-
alfo may be justly attributed the never
to be fusticiently lamented depravity of
manners. Young people of both Sex-
es,
who vrere once renowned for being
O
the brightest examples of the most ex-
alted virtue, are now become the Scorn
of
i
/

t

/
h’
k
(
)
of their acquaintance; and that good-nefs of heart which once feeined to be the Sole Spring of all their actions, is Seen / no more, and vice now rears her standard, where virtue lately displayed her banners. To stem this torrent of evil, -and to restore virtue to its pristine luf-
tre is the most ardent wiSh of the
\
thor
au-
of the following
streets. From
:ne fubfec|uent stiort llcetch, the reader will be enabled to form a proper judgment of the v/hole work. The story is very interesting, the incidents are related in the most corredl, clear and concife method imaginable; the language is pure and chaste; all ex-preffions v/hich might afford the lightest shadow of corruption are studiouf-ly avoided, and the utmost care has been taken to infert nothing but what will tend to instrudt and reform, as well as amufe the mind of the reader As this is the Scope which the au-
has prescribed to himfelf, he doubts not in the least of with the approbation of all thofe who
shall

Shall take the pains of perufing this work, which if he is So happy as to meet with, he will ever entertain a grateful rememberance of the favour conferred on him, and will endeavour to testify his most fincere acknowledgement by dedicating his labours to the Service of thofe who honour them with their countenance. As he has neither the views of honours or interest to influence him, he flatters himfelf that he has gained the Summit of his defires, by having produced a work which, at the fame time that it delights, conveys the most in-strudlive lessons of virtue. He therefore takes the liberty of recommend-
attention of the
ing his work to the
polite youth of both Sexes, and flatters himfelf that their approbation of his endeavours to pleafe them will crown his attempts. It may perhaps be objedted that he has introduced none but perfons in the most exalted stations of life; but it must be remembered that VIRTUE alone Should
be
\

be the distinguishing charadleristic of every claSs, and that without this or-
all our adlions loSe their

merit. If he is So happy as to afford any pleaSure to his readers, he will esteem his labours overpaid, and will rejoice at having been the happy means of contributing Somewhat towards the reformation of the Britilh youth. This is his first attempt; he therefore flatters himSelf that he Shall meet with the approbation of thofe who do not blufh at being thought good. It is needlefs to fay any further of a work, which the author would wiSh Should recommend itfelf by its merit alone,

contrary to modern
general run

productions, which ufually make their way into the world by dint of the most flagrant impudence of thofe who endeavour, by a well written title-page to alure the wretched effects of their mistaken genius or the too credulous public.

Without carrying our readers into the nurSery, and informing them with what tenderneSs and assiduity parental fondneSs watched over his infantile years, we shall only obServe that at a very early age, when others are amuf-ed with toys, Thalmeno, (for So was the young prince nam.ed) had acquired an uncommon degree of sskill in martial exer-ciSes, which were his delight; and So great was his proficiency in this kind of study, that ere he attained the years of maturity, he gave the most flattering hopes of one day becoming an experienced and Successful general; and in every
reSpefl worthy of his royal extradlion.

For his genius and learn-
cvery opportunity of improving prepo!-Seshons in his favour—from nature too he derived parts strong and lively, which education had polished and improved. From his tongue dropped the eloquent and enchanting phraSes of his admired Demosthenes, ing, he Soon acquired the reputation of the wife learned prince; for his manners, the charader of the most amiable.
, Thus distinguished by nature and by art, who had each So largely contributed to form our young prince, no wonder if he was beloved.^—Had Pallas heard of his' merit, she could not have withheld her approbation and praifes of his perfe<5lions.
Juno, if she had Seen his perSon, would have forSaken her Jupiter; and the Syrens themSelves, had they fixed their eyes upon his features, would have withdrawn their melody from timorous Ulysses, and tuned

The royal parents viewed their riling, hopes in the bloomy Spring of life with extacy of joy; nor did their piety want any incitement to their gratitude towards heaven for So Sweet a Son.—They daily rendered millions of thanks to the propitious deity who had thus blest their de-, dining years with the precious boon, while, the happy citizens thronged to the temple of the goddeSs Fortune, to offer up their daily thanks for So inestimable a blessing as the young and gallant heir of their fiou-. rishing empire.

therefore went in Search of Thalmeno,
and familiarly discovered to him the news he haci heard of his intentions, which the
young prince no Sooner understood, but he was overjoyed that he had found So princely a partner of his future fortunes : in conSequence of this meeting, they re-folved to depart immediately; and furnishing themSelves with Such necessaries as were befitting for their voyage, they Secretly departed, diredling their courSe to Trapani; one of the principal ports of Cecilia; where

discovered a lady. Sweet and amiable, fitting under the shady leaves of a fig-tree, recreating her SenSes with the Sweet Sound of a well-timed lute, to which she joined her ravishing voice.

The lady pondering upon this deplorable Speech, Soon conceived in her breast a motion of relaxation, which Secretly inSplred
her to entertain them with all agreeable curiofity ; and taking them kindly by the
hand, condudfed them to an
dining- room, commanding her virgins to furnish the table with Such as her Solitary habitation could afford ; the young adventurers very orderly, without any prolix ceremonies, fell hungrily to their meat. For this repast they returned their
thanks, which was no Sooner ended, than Thalmeno (burning with deSire to know the effedlual cauSe of this lady’s deSolate retirement) with a princely grace, continued his precedent diScourSe.
“ Madam, if the repetition of your
misfortunes renew not your grief, or the display of your Sorrows increaSe not your

you make this deSart your domestical manSion; and the occaSion why, with numberleSs Sighs, you repeat the name of Medor. Indeed, Madam, So much beauty and divine perfedions should rather befit a monarch’s court than a rural habitation ; and a prince’s bed than a pil-

exempted from adverSity; for as Soon the prince as the peaSant, the lady of honour as the poorest virgin, are, or may be crofff

ed with Cupid’s darts, the sting of Sorrow,

or the tyranny of misfortune.”
The prince having ended his Speech,
the lady made him this anSwer:
“ Sir, at your request, 1 will inform jiou
that I have long Since loved a young and
noble youth, his name I shall forbear

mentioning, by reaSon the motive will renew the birth of my accustomed diScon--SpiateneSs; however that you may not condemn me of perverSe ingratitude, I will, if you pleaSe to attend my arrival, go to my cloSet, and their constrain my trembling pen to Set forth the Secrets of my Sorrows, and in effedl, to diScover the •Sole history of my misfortunes.”
Thalmeno and Palmos rejoicing at this unexpedled favour, accepted of her kind offer, and having familiarly Saluted each other, she immediately departed to her cloSet, and in a short time returned to
the young princes, and delivered herSelf in this short Speecli.
“ Genlle strangers, to Satisfy your earnest demands, here, take this paper, wherein, though rudely, yet Sincerely, I have demonstrated the cauSe of my retire-rnent, and petmed down the griefs that I

Having received the paper, with tears
in their eyes, they kissed her mournful .

Some for their private wealth. So others I hated for their public enormities. But, Cupid storming at my liberty, and Ve-nus at my Single estate, acknowledging that there was no life but love, nor no paradiSe but the pleaSures of marriage, they So bent their invedive ambition a-gainst my innocency, that at last, by the means of Fortune, who had likewiSe intruded herSelf in the union of their Sympathy, they unexpededly Sent to my father’s court, a lovely young prince, named Medor, the Son and heir of Orlando,

conveyed thither by the instintSI: of nature,

and others ereCted by the ingenuity of art.

Upon the borders of theSe fountains were growing many fruitful trees, whereon were artificially ranged divers harmonious birds. In short, there wanted no ornament to make this fumptuous palace a terrestrial paradiSe: it was impaled with lofty cedars, fenced draw-bridges, and impregnable bulwarks; likewiSe circumferenced with many curious rivers. Our two princes, with their nymphs, being arrived to this
dignified palace, were forthwith met by

an, ancient matron, who. Seeming to be the lady thereof, very kindly gave them a welcome. Her habit was of a Sable hue,
I
having her Snowy hair hanging down her

face ; her beauty Seemed to be nipped by age; yet, in the lineaments of her complexion, lay furrovred the anatomy of an indifferent countenance; the arches of her
ft
Sorrowful eyes' were over-veiled with a crimSon dye, from out of whoSc conduits it appeared many brinish tears had had th eir issue. After Some conversation with her unexpected guests, perceiving the zeal of their youthful resolutions were devoted to travel, she, with a faint
voice, effedt:
delivered herSeif to the following
“ Courteous friends, for Such I hope you are, fear not to enter this palace, but

H AviNG Spoken theSe few words, she abruptly broke off, and, as fast as she could, fled to the forests. The princes, feeing the Sudden departure of this ancient lady, were much astoniSned ; but, at last, assuming courage, and the Sable night beginning to over-cast the element with ob-Jcurity, after taking leave of their nymphs, boldly entered •, passing the outward gate, they were met by two beautiful virgins, who. Saluting them with a Smiling countenance, arm in arm, most lovingly conducted them to a stately theatre, where they beheld manv amorous ladies with their gallants. After a short stay, they were conducted to a very rich bed-chamber, where Several frolickSorne Sparks were nnchastly courting their beauteous mistresses; and, in Such an indecent man-

oussy craved their abSence, which was immediately complied with ; when, thinking to repoSe themSelves, they were again Sollicited by two blooming virgins, vsho, bringing their lutes in their hands, with melodious muSic thought to lull th^ir premeditations asteep. Immodest Smiles they had at command; their garments were both gay and looSe, and in all things, fitly corresponding with their inward qualities.

But Morpheus had nor long detained their Spirits in delicious fiu'mber, but having contracted his influence with the in-stindt of celestial deity, they were in the depth of their nodturnal steep alarmed by a hideous clamour, which rattled in the palace with Such a thundering noiSe, as if ths

At the Sight of this pretty pigmy, with
adviSed deliberation they pondered upon the etymology of his Speech, and could not, at first, refrain from being astonished. After ruminating more Serioussy on their Situation, they reSolved to follow their tender guide; and, arming their courage with magnanimity, stew thro’ the courts, directing their steps to a lofty mountain, from when*^e they Saw this glorious palace

them, and to comfort their passions, the
old forlorn lady which they first met, a-gain preSented herSelf to their view ; and
after having lowly Saluted them, mourn* fully uttered the following words,
“ My Sons, Says she, m^y name is Virtue, who, of my own authority, invented this tragedy for your advantage ; the glorious
manSion which you have Seen destroyed, is the temple of folly, wherein only remained the imps of luxurious iniquity ; who, pampering up lustful Cytherea, were always persecutors of chaste Diana, my Society they ever diSdairied, and contu-melioufiy Smothered my temples with the contagious incest of debauchery ; a-

The young princes were greatly astonished at what they had Seen, and on opening the paper found the following rules contained in it:

“ Your, arrival hath neither disturbed my study, nor your preSence prejudiced my patience—for as my nature is not attradlive to Severity on the one Side, So, on the contrary, I make

ARLY in the morn before the pearled dew was exhaled by the shining rays of golden Phcebus,when the fragrant flowers were displaying the pride of their beauty, and the melodious birds on the Swelling bushes, warbling forth their melody, it chanced that Th almo, captivated with the beauty of Athelia, betook him-felf to the fields, not only to refresh his tormented mind, but to make the flowery meadows acquainted with his amorous

and made the forests echo with his malady, he reSolved to return.—At his departure, fortune So ordained it, that the

“ Madam,
“ When, by the aid of Fortune, I Saw So much beauty, I immediately felt my tender breast inSpired with a lover’s pashon ; and to Such a degree, that ever Since, I have firmly Sworn my fidelity to the Service of your Superior excellence
at the appearance of So many charms, my fenSes' are So much captivated, that all I
am now capable of, is to admire you.—My birth is Such, that, if known to you, might plead much in my behalf—therefore, dear
madam, if my fighs might diScloSe, my tears explain, or my passions diScover what a zealous flame my heart poffeffes in your favour, I think you would not only recompence my deSert, but alSo repay my fidelity with your affedlion ; and here I determine, till the period of my pilgri-

mage, to remain as constant to the prin-ceSs Atheli A, as I wish she should be affable to the perplexed Thalmo.”
The princeSs, (being unacquainted with Such amorous encounters) sharply returned him this anSwer.

“Why Thalmo, Said she, hath my kindneSs made thee So arrogant, or my
undeserving favour fo preSumptuous, that thou shouldst difcourSe to me of love hath my affability emboldened thee to aSpire fo high, as to declare thy affedli-on to one So much thy Superior ? Hath idleneSs in my Service, taught thee to a-[ dorn thy tongue with flattery ?—And is

To be brief, refrain from proSecuting thy folly, or I will uSe fiich means that the king, my father, shall be made acquainted with your preSumption,”
This decissve anSwer might doubtlest have made a Soldier retire for fear—-but Thalmo, disdaining to quit the Siege for the first repulSe, earnestly continued his
diScourSe.
“ I F you conjedlure. Madam, that in discovering my affedlions, I flatter your merits with a fliew of derifion, you great?* ly wrong my honour—^^therefore, dear Ma«*

“ Th A L M O, replied the princeSs, if thy affedtion were equal to the tenor of

Since my mind cannot be fubjedt to Servile love, let my commands be a mediatrix to cauSe the.e to bid a final adieu to thy

that he should not conceive any Spark of hope, where there was no performance

“ Is it possible, madam, that So much beauty and cruelty can dwell together ? and is it possible, that each being the o-ther’s enemy, they should both Seek my ruin:—ConSider, princeSs, the purity of my pretence, and the defire of my expectation! and think, that if Thalmo

A FTER theSe amorous contemplations, he remained So restleSs that no obje<st could pleaSe him but the idea of the fair Mer-siLVA ; no thought could content him unlefs- fprung from her virtue; nor no

Mersilva received the letter, and gueshng from whence it came, opened it with a blushing countenance ;which having read, she fetched a deep figh, and found her SenSes Surrounded with many agree* able notions of Plivio’s perfedions; every line Seemed to make a Smooth path for Cupid’s entrance; however, after a little refiedion, (considering the favours

Walking upon the borders of theSea, they came to a little creek, where they Saw an aged fisherman repairing his nets.
Having given him the time of the day, they ashed him, if for recreation, he would take them a league on the ocean :—the fisherman demanded a recompence, to which they willingly complied, and with a pleaSant breeze they put to Sea.
I N this manner they passed away the

of her deplorable Situation ; and likewiSe begged of him, with tears in her eyes, to

on the Sea.—The fisherman moved to compassion by her outward Sorrow, and instigated by her liberality, condeScended to her reasonable request.
This courSe they continued many days, with as much Satisfadlion to Florina as iS she had been triumphing in her Sormer dignity.—At last, Sortune reSolved to add more miSery to her afflidtion, and cauSed her unexpedledly to fall within the labyrinth of a greater misfortune.
Sailing witha pleaSant gale about two leagues from the shore, they were brought to by a Turkish Xebeque, who fired a gun as a Signal for that purpoSe, and hoisting their Sails, immediately bore down upon them. As Soon a^ they came along fide

near at hand to reScue her from their cruelty.—Florin A being the last that entered, the Turkish staves no Sooner beheld her angelic beauty, than they clapped their hands, and threw their caps in the air, being overjoyed that they had got So glorious a prize to preSent to their Sultan.

Notwithstanding this unexpedfed indulgence, she could not forget her loft Medor she wept, as if his abSent idea had a regal prerogative to create her tears, and lamented the unfortunate accident that had lately befallen her.—In her contemplations she ruminated upon his ab^ fence, and her own preSent miSery,frequent

panions to enter another apartment, where he presented them with Such reSreSnment, as his homely dwelling afforded ;—the re past being over, he ashed the ladies to recreate themSelves in the garden, to which they readily conSented, and were attended by their lovers.—Passing thro’ a Sragrant walk, planted with beaiuiSul trees and fiowering shrubs, they attained the entrance of a garden, beautiful be-
yond description,; after viewing the flowers and fragrant herbs, and tasting of the choicest fruits to avoid the excessive heats of the Sun, they betook themSelves to the
bowers, where their beloved princes congratulated them with their happy welcome.—The stranger viewing their innocent familiarity, brought to his remembrance his past pleasures v:ith the princeSs

Athelia perceiving him at a distance, ruminating on his unhappy lot, began to
SurmiSe that he was in love with Some lady, whoSe cruelty was the cauSe of his Suffering ; and pondering on'his.grief by her own Sorrow, bewailed his misfortune, and compassionated his affliction.—They plainly perceived that their arrival had renewed his grief, and lamented to bring that a-fresh to his memory which proved his torment.—Ac length the ladies returned to the cottage, and in the way found a paper that contained the following words :

The prince pondered upon her affectionate words, and not able to contain Such ardent expressions, requested she would banish from her breast the memory of Sorrow, and let contentment flourish in her mind:—‘‘and, dear Florina,” Said he, “ Since Fortune hath So ordained it, that now, contrary to my expeflation, you are made my happy priSoner, know, empreSs of my thoughts, and angel of my imaginations, that, with most reSpedlable company, I ’am bound for Cicilia, where, as

So violent was the storm, that it struck
