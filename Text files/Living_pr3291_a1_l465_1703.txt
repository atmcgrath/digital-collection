But as for their Sins both of 0^ mijfion and CommiIJimy to {peak in theLanguage of Some people who will be Angry with them, they are Manifoldy yesL Multifarious; The Authors have theirs, the bookfeller ought to be call d in question for hisy and they question not but from theperufal of his own, the Printer will not be angry if he comes in for a Share of the buh-lick Cenfure.

What Remains, is to beg Ex-cufe for the Letters between the King of Spain and the Duke of ^urgundy^ and if the Author has been too hasty in Surrendring
before the GariSon could be brought to beat the Chamade^ or Fort Matagorda was Taken, it must be imputed to his Good If which were too quick, and outmn 3, Cood E<vent.
V
To Instance in one articular; if theSe Letters in General have not that Poignancy of Wit, as Some that have been in the ^refs thefe Twelve Months last past, they are lefs Obvious on account of their Title to the ^uhlick 3^-marks^ stnce it s Something more eaSy to make the Lining Episto-lize one another, than to have a

That excellent Virtue was Coin*d on pUrpoSe for the ufe of the Clergy, and was a Noflrum peculiar to the Gentlemen of your Cloth, till the Lay Citizens thought you were overstock'd with a Commodity of that Nature, and broke in upon you, and star’d in common With you.

Some of t>ur Brethren, I must: Confefs, after the Inhabitants had de-X ny’d us Neceffaries for our Money,
made bold to drink the Queen of £»-gUn^s Health in Some of their Wine-
fellars pretty plentifully; and when they were merry, perhaps, like true Con-querours, they might Seek out for a few Female Captives, to ExerciSe their Fury upon; but what ever they administer’d to the Sptmi[b Ladies I affure you was perform’d with that Modesty and Ten-dernefs, that I never yet heard one of them Complain of her ufage.

the

the Contrary, the Nuns lik’d us better than their Priests, and the Towns-wo-wen better than their Husbands.
I have nothing farther to entertain you from St. Maries^ of my own ; but a Brother Volunteer being troubled with a Rhiniing Scrubbade, has ventur’d to exercife his starving Facultie amongst us upon the foregoing Occa-ston; and to Show his Wit in an Army, has run the Hazard of being thought a Coward. Whether it will Relifh with your nice Pallate when it Comes to your tast, I know not; but I affure you the Bullet headed Critticks among us, notwithstanding the Scarcity of Paper, have hitherto preferv’d it
from being made Bumfodder. Therefore
I hope, as it is well intended by the Author, it will be So accepted from your aSTured Friend and humble Servant.

Nothing goes amiSs to me, and as I rim at all, So I burthen my Memory . wlih every thing I hear, whether Mat* ters of fbme Moment or none. Having told you my Trade, ir is but Na-tural for you to expect a Cast of my Office. To the Bufinest in Hand then, there's not a Dust of Tobacco in Town, but what bears the Name of Right
Snuff; and one fingle Galleon is Reported to have brought home more Pigs of Silver, than the whok Spamjh Plate Fleet had in it. I was afraid at first, there would have been no occa-fion for Ways and Means to Raife more Money, and that Men of my Bufinefs would be wholly fet Afide, but it teems things go quite otherwite, and the Four
Shillings in the P---T«-^ is likely to

Whether his Lordfhip will do like the Fox and Refund, I can’t tell, but every one knows there are thole in the World, that are theNations Godfathers, can force him to it. I am not for the Rigour of the Law, but with the Gentleman, that was for taking his Wife and Daughter into Custody: There’s Flelh, marry is there, and were they but half ; fo W icked as they are Hand-fom, they would make an Attonement , with me for thrice the Sum, and go a great way towards the dilcharge of an old dry wither'd CarkaSs, that has been a Stranger to the Comfortsuf Matrimony for many years.
