From the Same to the Same.
HAVE hardly opened my eyes, Sophy; and yet I cannot help fitting down to tell you what a delightful evening I had. Such a partner!—I talked of Beverly; but who could cast a fingle glance at him, when Sir Edward Stanly appearedWhat a figure, take him altogether I what a height! what a shape! v/hat grace in his motions! what an animated complexion ! what fine dark languishing eyes! what hair what teeth !

O
S
lire and fast hold of your heart dangerous enough in all conScience!—But to this Sir Edward.
There is no deScribing Sir Edward. I cannot do justice to his eaSy mien, nor the becoming negligence of his manner. But there is an intolerable non-chdance in his behaviour, apparently arifing from his believing himSelf of Sufficient conSe-quence to win all hearts by his negledt.. There will be Some glory in a conquest over Such a man. But as he happens to know that he is So enchanting a creature, he will not very eafily Surrender, I fancy. However, I will try my power. From this moment, ye Beverlys^, tec. tec.—rye Soft, Supple, fimple,. inconstant fighers, adieu! give place to
the elegant,^ the amiable Stanly. Nothing
M
21
thing will I leave undone to fix him in my train: nothing will I negledl to make him absolutely, Serioussy in love with me. I do not tell you, Sophy, that I will ever be in love with him: remember that, my dear ; and yet, when I look in his face—what a divine pair of eyes the wretch -has i—But I must cure him of his lelf-conceit.—I detest a fellow who behaves like a Narcissus. Thole kandSome devils are fo apt, like fine women, to be vain.—Beverly is reckoned handfome, you know: he is nobody compared to Stanly, who is as much the man of fenSe, as he is the man of fashion, and the man of taste. I could not think of dancing with Beverly, you know, when Such a fellow. So much Superior to him, appeared. The very instant I beheld him, I began to conSider kow I should shake off Beverly,—Now
you.
£2 FEMALE FRAILTY.
I SuppoSe, would have made a fuSs about your promiSe, and Such nonSenSe.
Where is the woman in her wits who ever kept her word with a man ^ I know better, Sophy: and So, as I was Saying, I immediately Seemed not to See Beverly, though he was fiddling about me all the time : he was reSolved, however, not to be negledted, and, therefore, claimied my hand.—I drew it back in a hurry.—“ Hold, Sir,” cried I, with a look Sufficient to turn him into stone.
“ I have changed my mind. I have not determined wffiether I shall dance or no.” “ True woman,” replied she, with a half-Smiling, halS-angry Sace; “ fickle as the wind.”
Or we should not reSemble your Sex, Sir,” anSwered I, in the most good humoured accents. “ But as I am So changeable an animal, Mr. Beverly, it
would

would be downright cruelty to keep you in SuIpenSe, and to deprive any other Lady oS So excellent a partner.’* There I Sweetened him, Sophy, till he hardly knew how to anSv/er me. So -bewitching is flattery !—In short, I never knew flattery Sail.—The man could have beat me but just before: on a Sudden his note was changed.
“ Dear MiSs Wroughton, as I looked upon mySelf as engaged to you, I will wait your time.”
“ Oh, no

Said,

are returned. Madam, will you give me leave to lead you into the Sett ? ”
I Smiled conSent. My hand was in his in a moment, Sophy ; and it was the Softest hand I ever felt: No man ever had a Softer. He dances, as he does every thing elSe, I believe, with infinite eaSe, with a grace peculiar to himSelf. His behaviour was that of an accomplished gentleman, there was not the fiightest appearance of the coxcomb in it. His addreSs was perfedtly polite; but there was not the Smallest Spark of gallantry in it: Not a fingle flattering Ipeech dropped from his lips the whole evening; and

yet his carriage was So particular to me.
VOL. I.

\
that envy was excited in the boSom of every worhan, and jealouSy in the breast of every man who had distinguished me before.
Beverly, though Seemingly very much attached to his partner, watched -us pretty cloSely; and from his looks I con-jeiflured (more than from any Singularity in Sir Edward’s behaviour to me) that he thought Sir Edward had no averSion to me. Yet there is a careleffneSs in his manner which, while it pleafes—every thing he does must pleaSe—makes me imagine that the woman who wishes to keep him as a lover will have a troublesome talk. A man So completely formed to charm must be conScious of his power, and, undoubtedly, deSirous of exerting
t
it.—But I have almost tired my hand in writing about him, and yet I cannot compofe niy mind to think upon any

other Subje6l:.—A bad Symptom this!
I would give the world now to know what this enchanting fellow's reste<5l:ions are j ust at this time. I am only prompted by curiofity; nothing elle, Sophy, believe me. My heart is still my own, thank heaven, and I am.

“ Ay, I SuppoSe you are an unbeliever, but we have certainly hearts : I feel mine at this very instant, in a terrible bustle.”

Sir Edward either did not, or would not, through poHteneSs, appear to See how much I was diSconcerted: (What a difference is there in men, Sophy?) But that wretch Beverly^—who owed me a grudge in my preferring Sir Edward to him'—turning to him. Said, “ I would give a good deal, Stanly, to stave Seen you stere a few minutes fooner..

The wretch!—I coloured again.
Sir Edward bowed. To prevent his actually imagining, from what Beverly had blundered out, that I really was in love with him, I replied—“ Sir Edv/ard must make allowance for the vivacity of his friend, who (as his volatile Ipirits will not give him time to lee , things as they are) is very apt to put a wrongcon-strudlion on themd’
“ It would have been very happy^ for mcy madam,” Said Sir Edward, with a Smile, “ if he had not been mistaken here.”
He

He then turned the conversation, though I Saw plainly that he was extremely pleaSed: I SuppoSe I shewed no Small Satisfaction with my eyes, for Beverly looked quite out of humour all the evening. Sir Edward, however, made a little apology to my aunt, when she came down, for his appearance in her dining room; telling her, that as he had haci the honour of dancing with me at Soho, •he took the liberty of calling to know

Mrs. Morden who is, I will allow though she frequently lectures me—-naturally civil, received his compliment very gracioully, and when he was gone. Said he was a genteel well-bred man.
During his stay, which was by no means tedious, I rallied Beverly for not
having made any enquiry after MiSs Garlics.

O U .are a strange girl, Clara, and will never See your danger till it is not in your power to avoid it .—However, to convince you that I have taken pains to open your eyes, I have made a very particular enquiry about Mifs Miles> the unSortunate young perSon I mentioned who had been Seduced by Sir Edward. She is the daughter of a clergyman who received his living from the father of Sir Edward, and being a man remarkable for the finenefs of his under-

ments, was uncommonly distinguished
/*
by Sir Henry. Mr. Miles, in return, behaved with much deference, and grateful relpedt to his patron, and was frequently invited by him to Ipend whole days at Stanly-Hall.—During the vifits made by the good clergyman and his family. Sir Edward, then Mr. Stanly, became intiniate with Sally Miles; who, with a very pretty perfon, had a very delicate mind greatly improved by a virtuous education. This Sir Edward, however, shared no pains to corrupt the
principles strongly
by her
amiable father ; and, at last, carried her off to a little hunting-feat about an hour’s ride from the hall.—There he kept her above two years, and then left her to lament her fate alone: there she still remains a prey to melancholy, and despondence.
M
55
Spondence.—Now, my dear, in my opL nion, the Sedudtion of this virtuous girl, the only child of So worthy a father, venerable, from his age and infirmities, and highly refpedlable from his understanding, and his morals; was a flagrant crime, and that Sir Edward is doubly culpable, as he knew that his father always profeffed a particular regard for Mr. Miles, who died about fix months after he discovered his daughter’s ruin ; unable, it is thought, to Survive it. This is the story as I have heard it au-» thentically related :, and if you can now Suppofe fuch a man as Sir Edward, fit to be even trifled with, you pay him a compliment to which I can never fubScribe ; for I look upon him as the most abandoned of his fex, and confequently to be avoided with the greatest circumfpedtion by every virtuous woman. I am, indeed.

extremely Surprised to See shch men defi-rous of associating with Such women; as they, by always endeavouring to make them as vicious as themSelves, Sufficiently prove that vicious women are more agreeable to their taste than any others. However, not contented with the number already made to their hands, they chiefly employ themfelves to lay Snares for the innocent and unwary; and they not only Seduce them from the paths of virtue, but render them fo excessively looSe, that Well—I am amazed that men who have had a genteel education can bear to associate with women, who having lost all fenSe of shame, as well as their cha-rafters, behave with the most difgustiilg impudence, and strive, with a cruel activity to bring the modest among their Sex upon a footing with them.—Surely no woman who has the least regard for

IierSelf will eondeScend to make herSelf agreeable to any man at the expence of her honour: She who is careleSs about her reputation is in a fair way, how strong however her prefumption may be, to join the wretched herd whom I have marked out as deterring examples.
If women of chara<ster would, with a proper Spirit, diScourage all men who make any attempts to draw them into dishonourable fituations, fewer of our Sex would be plunged into mifery by yielding improperly to thofe who profeSs the fincerest attachment to them: how few indeed are absolutely ruined by their flattering lovers but by their own in-« discretion !

Told you I-must humour this girl, and I have humoured her; I have
almost Spoilt her. She is- become as capricious, and as fantastical as any of her Sex can poshbly be; and that is Saying a great deal: Yet, I let her alone, that I may See how far she will go; and that I may inSist, in my turn, upon a reaSonabie allowance of coxcombry, if I shall think it necessary. At preSent, however, I shall accommodate mySelf to her plan, which is, I plainly perceive, to enroll me among
the

the number of her lovers : but she does not know, she shall not know that I have my caprices.—ASter all, I never yet met with Such a woman as Clara Wroughton. With her perSon, her SenSe, her taste, she is So much Superior to the majority of her Sex, that I can See no charms in any other woman when she is preSent; and yet Beverly has given her up very quietly for a little blushing country innocent; whoSe merit is entirely confined to her naivete. Perhaps he deSpaired of Succeeding with Clara; So much the better for me, who am determined to try her. I must, however, condudt my manceuvres with: great addreSs, to prevent their being fufpedled. I am, at prefent, in the See-Saw way: this moment I a6t the infenjtble., the next I appear a little like a lover.

Thought to have been with you ere now, but am detained here by an accidental rencontre with one oS the most amiable women I ever beheld.
r
y
I landed at Dover aSter a rough, stormy passage, Which made me wish to rest my-Self a little ere I proceeded to London. While I waited for my chaiSe I took a turn round the Cliff, as it was a very fine clear day, having a strong fancy to re-ww a place fo strongly defcribed by our
inimitable.
FEMALE FRAILTY. 83
inimitable, immortal ShakeSpeare. When I came within fight of it, I had, most luckily, an opportunity to reScue two ladies from the rude attacks of a fellow who, by his drefs, appeared to be an officer, but who discovered nothing of the gentleman in his behaviour.—He had just quitted one of the young ladies, and had Seized the other, the Sweetest
creature imaginable, who made violent efforts to diSengage herSelf, assisted by an
elderly lady—her mother—as I was afterwards informed.—In a short time I made the infolent wretch, who had prefumed to injure a woman So uncommonly beautiful, decamp, and received the thanks both of the mother and the daughter for my generous, and effedtual interposition.—The acknowledgments of the latter were conveyed to me in the Softest accents I ever heard.—iCharmed
E6
with
84 FEMALE FRAILTY.
with having been oS any Service to her^ I entreated her and the other ladies to let me attend them to the place to which they were going. They returned me thanks; and the elderly lady added
We have a carriage waiting for us at the inn where Mr. and Mrs. SympSon the father and mother of this young lady—(looking at my lovely creature’s companion) wait for tis. Mr. SympSon was taken i-11 with a diSorder in his stomach, but infisted upon our going without him to take a view of this celebrated Ipot, as he had brought us on purpole in his coach from Canterbury, where he lives,, and I am with my daughter upon a viSit to his family.”
I afked them if they had Seen the castle; they replied in the negative, as they had no gentleman to accompany
them> and as they did not xhuSe, indeed,

deed, to be So long abSent from their friends.
I then attended them to the inn, where, in conSequence of the very favourable mention made of me, I was received with the greatest politeneSs by Mr. and Mrs. SympSon, who invited me to their houSe at Canterbury—“ that we may thank you in a better manner’* Said the old gentleman.
You may. be Sure, Stanly, that I did not want any preffing; you may be Sure that I was ready enough to comply with an invitation So agreeable to my taste.
I took care, alSo, that they might not have any reaSon to repent of their civilities, to let them know to whom they thought themSelves obliged, and had the Supreme Satisfadlion to find, that the reSpedt was paid to me alone, as it was not in the least increaSed after the discovery

covery of my rank.—^I accordingly accepted of their invitation: pleaSed with the, honest frankneSs of their behaviour,
. s	/
and still more pleaSed with the lovely MiSs Evelyn-—the yoimg lady whom I So fortunately refcued—whom I found, on a nearer acquaintance, fenSible, and entertaining, eaSy in her carriage, and quite diScreet. In short, Stanly, she appears to me to-have every qualification necessary to render the marriage state happy.—However, the idle notion of yours which you have been continually beating into my head, with regard to the chastity of the woman who has never been tried, makes me fearful of putting the important question: and yet, I Swear it will be cruel to try this angelic creature ; she looks sh innocently lovely: she is not Such a high-Spirited girl as your Clara, who will, I hope, lead you

During our stay at Canterbury, Mr. SympSon would carry us to See Dover-Castle, Pier, &c. &c. &c. but, within a quarter of a mile of Dover, Mr. Symp-fon was Seized with the gout in his stomach.

ASter having taken Something which Soon relieved him a little, he infisted upon my mother’s going with me and MiSs SympSon to See the pier.—We complied, yet with reluctance, and were followed by a very impertinent fellow, dressed like an officer. He first attacked me; I bad the good fortune to difengage mySelf from him: he then caught hold of my friend : after having rudely kissed her, he a Second time Seized me. While I was struggling with him, a gentleman stew to my assistance. On his Swift approach the other made off, and my deliverer defired leave to wait on us all to the place we were going to.—Mr. SympSon not only received him at our return with great civility, but invited him to Canterbury; and was not leSs pleaSed to find that 4

I hope there are ; I am certain there are ; becauSe his Lordship is not at all vain or astuming; and he, undoubtedly, would have been So, had he been the only charming man in the world. Every gentleman will interpoSe when a woman is improperly attacked. There was nothing, therefore.

“ Will they be pleafing do you think,”' Said she, “ when you have Seen Sophy Evelyn,'* Sophy has a clear, brown complexion, fine dark eyes, and dark, but glossy hair: and her features are ranged with the utmost regularity.

“ And do you think, now” added she.

“ Perfectly So, if you will treat me with leSs feverity,” replied I, throwing my arm round her waist, and fighing for akiSs which I, adfually, dared not sto take. So fearful was I of offending her.
Could she be- offended ? you will fay, perhaps.
Why she might not really have been offended, but she might have thought it "prudent to appear offended; and indeed she will always appear So when I proceed to Such liberties if she is the woman I take her to be: and yet, tho* I wish to find her chaste, I shudder at the idea of

When, therefore, we rested!: upon the confe-quences with which the irregularities of an inconstant wife may be attended, can we too carefully guard against an event for which no atonement can be made ? But to return to Clara she Seemed pleaSed with my freedoms, but difcreet-ly thought it incumbent on her to reprove me for them, by withdrawing herfelf from my arms, and faying—“ I fancy a little Severity, as you call it.

“ So you Say,’* anSwered she, with the most delicious, half-inviting, half-forbidding Smile, gently striving to diSen-gage her hands from mine; “ but were you to be indulged in all your fooleries, you would quickly change your tone.’*
“ Only try me, Clara,” Said I, pulling her into my lap.
“ Nay now. Sir Edward,” cried she, rifing in a hurry, it is high time to leave you.”—Her looks and her voice were immediately altered: she was no longer the playful and the tender, but the lofty, and the awful beauty. I was

more liberties than I approved oS; I checked him, and he leSt me abruptly: I could have borne his abrupt departure, tho’ I Scarcely cloSed my eyes all night after it; but when he abSented himSelf a whole week, I felt how necessary his prefence was to my peace. I cannot tell you how peevish, how fretful I was with every creature about me. Mrs. Morden, and my Sukey, both wondered v/hat ailed me ; yet I kept my unea-fineffes to myfelf, and pleaded illneSs: by fo doing I alarmed my dear good aunt, and I hated myfelf for giving her pain—I continued extremely restleSs, and finding that he still kept away, hurried from one place to another in hopes of meeting him. At last I Saw him at Ranelagh flirting with a very pretty girl. I could hardly bear it, Sophy. I strove
to hide my feelings, but my efforts were
in

in vain. My companions perceived an instantaneous alteration in me; and all my acquaintance Surrounded me to enquire into the cauSe of it.
Stanly, at length, came up, and with a coolneSs Sufficient to freeze me to death, tho’ the room was as hot as a furnace, bowing carelefsly at the fame time. Said, “ Your most obedient, ma-flam. Are you not well ?”
I made him no anSwer: I was too much chagrined to make any reply; but tho’ I did not utter a Syllable, it was neither pride nor reSentment which tied my tongue: for I am Sure my looks discovered, in a great meaSure, what passed

I was filent, I was afraid of faying too much—I only Suffered him to lead me as he pleaSed,

With the greatest difficulty, Sophy, I got rid of him : he did not, I must own, behave improperly, but he will not, I See, bear much encouragement; and if he has no encouragement he will, certainly, fly off. I told you, from the firSt, that it would be a very nice point to keep Such a man to mySelf: I had endured So much, indeed, from his indifference, that I dreaded another quarrel before we were hardly reconciled.

And evenjy^ji^, my Sophy, with all your affedled indifference about you, would be Sorry to have no man think you worthy'of a trial. Let us not, then, carry our discretion to an extravagant pitch: there is no occafion to be out-rageoussy virtuous, as I once heard a lady Say to her companion who was inveighing, with great energy, against a poor girl who had been too condescending to her lover; and we do not knovr how we might have behaved in her fitu-ation.~I am very willing to own, that I

LARA is changed; and So am I. She is no longer the kind, consenting, yielding fair. She keeps up a distant, cool politeneSs with me, which is, by no means, to my humour.

alone. If I leave her for a week or ten days, as I did before, she will come to I SuppoSe: but I cannot bring myfelf to stay So long again from the woman of rny heart. Let her behave how she pleafes she will ever be mistreSs of my affedlions. This strange alteration in her behaviour to me ariSes, it Seems, from the irregn-larity of my proceedings : I should have talked of matrimony, and Settlements, and equipages, and jewels, &c. &c. &c. of which, I confefs, I never once thought and fo, perhaps I have lost her; had I been received as a lover in form, all reasonable liberties would have been undoubtedly allowed me: and I should have had numberleSs opportunities to Seize others. I might, in short, have been completely happy by this time had I played my cards in a masterly manner. And now I shall enter upon my aftergame
FEMALE FRAILTY. 141
game So aukwardly—I must not, however, loSe her.—There is madneSs in the idea.—I have not staid away, tho* she has been So diScouraging.—To bring her back into the old style, I have behaved with a coolneSs which I never felt.—It is imposhble to be indifferent about her. She has beauty to create deSire, and a thouSand nameleSs graces in her carriage to increaSe it.—With all her allurements, indeed, she is, at the Same time. So be-witchingly modest, that I deSpair of prevailing on her to yield to my earnest intreaties : and I should hate mySelf, were I capable of making uSe of any of thofe detestable arts which have been So often, and So Successfully tried: Such arts are beneath contempt. No, the woman whom I love must be mine from inclination—she must be free as air: she must
ad without the least restraint. Her love

her : I wish to See her as impassioned as mySelf, if she could diScover her passion with a proper degree of delicacy.—Such a woman is, I firmly believe, Clara Wroughton.'—But I cannot, how flattering Soever my diScoveries may be, marry her. She will, however, have this advantage over my other women—I shall ever feel for her a fuperior tenderneSs. I really think the girl is naturally chaste: but will the woman, who feels a strong propensity to pleaSe the man whom she loves, always feel the fame propenfity to pleafe hirn and no body elSe.?—The woman who loves with that kind of ardor v/hich can, alone, Satisfy me, is but ill provided against strong Solicitations. I hate your lukewarm mistresses, who either Seem to be half afleep in your arms, or are studying how to decorate their perfons, or to

draw fresh Sums out of your pocket. Such mercenary devils I heartily defpile. I would Sooner perish than touch a woman who did not love me for myfelf.

1 own, Sophy, I was So conSuSed, to think of the dilemma into which I had brought mySelf, by this conversation, that I Scarce knew vrhat reply to make.
To have declared my opinion, would have been to afk him to marry me : and yet, what could I Say; as he would not understand me without a declaration of itI coloured, and turned away my face, to hide it; being conScious of looking like a Simpleton : yeti remembered what you had Said; and thought, at the Same time, that it was better to look like a fool, than to be dupecl. I told him, therefore, that I was Sorry to See a man So much in the world at a lofs to know hov/ to condudf himSelf; adding, that a man of real honour always knew how to behave to a woman of cha-radler; as he' could not but be SenSible
H 5
that

that his own reputation would be injured by his indiscretion, as well as hers.
He appeared rather diSconcerted, Sophy, at this anSwer, though he has a monstrous affurance. For my part, tho’
I wished to have him understand me, I
\
was So fearSul of goihg too far, that I felt mySelf exceshvely embarrassed. The Sweet fellow, then, feeing my di-streSs, came up to me, took me by the hand, and, with a reSpedtful tenderneSs, Said, “ Forgive me, Clara, if I have not Spoken as fully as I ought, not fully enough, at least, for you to understand me.—But how could you miS-understand me ? Could you fuppoSe I should follow you with any other deSign than to unite myfelf to you for ever by the most binding of all ties ? Could you possibly imagine, that I meant to trifle with you I
thought

thought you had a more favourable opinion of me.”
While he- uttered the few last words, he looked a thouSand inexpressible things, and his voice was So Softened, So bewitching,- that.

Now, my dear, I think I may venture to Say I have hopes of him. I am, by no means, certain of Securing him, indeed; but, by what I have heard, he has never dangled (as he calls it) after any woman So much as he has after me, without being more intimately connedled with her: I have alSo been told, that not one of his temporary favourites could keep him long Iblely attached to her.

Have been almost on the brink of another quarrel with Stanly.—Would
you believe it? neither Lady Jane Selby, nor Mrs. Mears, could, among their numerous acquaintance, get a ticket for the malked-ball; and they were, both. So much ashamed to diScover the Small-nefs of their interest with the men, that when they informed me they could not go with me, it was So late I could not tell how to procure a companion. Stan-

ly, availing himSelf of my disappointment, told me that he could not, possibly, furnish me v/ith another ticket.
4C
I cannot go then,” faid I.
He looked out of humour, and ashed me, if I was afraid to trust mySelf with him.
“ Not at all,” replied I; “ but you cannot expedl me to go v/ith you alone.”
I
“ And why notCan you be guilty of' any impropriety by going with the man to whom you are to be married ?”
“ When I am married to you,” faid I, “ there will not, indeed, be the least impropriety in my going with you to a maSquerade without company ; but even then the world would condemn Such a step, and perhaps laugh at us alSo.”
muttered “ And do

‘‘ I cannot absolutely Say So in every reSpedl; but I would not chooSe to make mySelf ridiculoiis, when I may, by staying Srom a mashed ball, eScape a great deal of raillery.”
“ Your staying away for So foolish a reaSon, will be ridiculous indeed, in my opinion; but you must do as you pleaSe, Madam : only, if you do not make uSe of your ticket, I shall be glad to give it to another Lady as beautiful as your-felf. Though jau do not chooSe to accompany me, who will.”
This Speech piqued me, Sophy, I confeSs: I was extremely mortified by it: I would have giveji up all the mash-

man’s going with him. I turned away; tears were ready to start from my eyes as foolishly weak as my heart: however, I strove to conceal them, pretending to have So violent a cold, that it would be much more prudent for me to stay at home—though I longed, you may imagine, to make my a,ppearance at the maSquerade.
“ You can determine, I fuppofe. Madam, in a couple of hours, whether you will favour me with your company, or not ?”
With thofe words, followed by a cool bow, he left me.
To my shame be it mentioned, I Sat down and cried for an hour, without being able to come to any refolution about my behaviour to Sir Edward.^—While I
was in a state of the utmost uncertainty, Nancy Garlics came; but, luckily, finding
FEMALE FEAILTY. 167
ing my aunt in the parlour, fiie did not run up to me, as uSual. She staid v/ith her till I was informed she was below. 1 had, therefore, time enough to recover myfelf.
She came up to me Soon afterwards.
“ I want to conSult you, my dear,’* Said she, “ about a dreSs for the fub-fcription-ball, as Lady Coleman is to take me with her and MiSs Coleman.”
I jumped at this intelligence; and alked her if their party was quite full;
“ I have only a fingle ticket, and none of my friends happen to be going but thoSe with whom I do not chooSe

“ I am Sure,” Said Nancy,

that
Lady Coleman will be glad of your
company

Accordingly, I appointed them to
call on me.
While

While we were Settling theSe important points, a mighty cool and conciSe note came from Stanly, to know my determination.
I anSwered it with equal coolneSs, and equal conciSeneSs; only mentioning my party.—^I then began to question my little blushing Nancy about Beverly; and she discovered a Scene that passed between them, which occafioned his departure from London, lest his diS-
grace
as he has the assurance to call
it—should become the talk of the town.
The cafe is this: He had made love to Nancy for fome time, in his faucy manner, and attempted to take liber-
^	X
ties after liberties. One evening, when he knew that Mrs. Serle was engaged to go out by herfeLf, he appeared, .and fat three whole hours with her.—During that time he behaved with an inSolence
which
EMA

which shocked her prodigioufiy : she rang, she called, she knocked.—Not a
creature came to her assistance; as he had fastened the door. At last, however, she Sound an opportunity to open-the windovr, and to cry out for help. A gentleman paffing by, at that instant, flew to her relief, and made Beverly look So ridiculous, that he could not
stand it: and So he is gone down to his
uncle’s in Kent, till
thing new
draws off the attention of the town from him.
Nancy told her tale very prettily.
and.
according
to her own account.
conduifted herfelf very difcreetly; yet I could not help finiling at her Simplicity.
“ Beverly,” Said I to her, “ must certainly think you have no dissike to his proceedings, my dear, as you Suffered him fo quietly to fasten the, door.

“ Indeed, MiSs Wroughton,” replied she, “ I knew nothing of the matter. I never once imagined that any gentleman could have behaved So : but I shall be more upon my guard Sor the future, and will never she alone with a man
again.

I choSe a dreSs from a drawing I had Seen of a beautiful Greek stave, and was taken up by Lady Coleman in the character of a Roman matron. MiSs Cole-

then he was tinmafked, and feetned to
f
take great pains to examine the faces of
all the elegant figures in the room.
At
length, he came up to our groupe, bargained for a noSegay with MiSs Coleman, and thee and thotfd a little with Nancy, (telling her, however, Ihe was not moved by a proper Spirit.) He Seemed rather shy of my lady; and then, accosted me with a freedom which Somewhat diSconcerted me in So publick a place. After having Surveyed me, apparently, with great Satisfaction, he threw his arm round my waist, and cried, in a gay tone, “ What is your purchaSe, my lovely girl .? name your price, and it shall be paid you instantly.”
“ Thankee, Sir,” replied I, curtSying, “ but I am above all price; and tho’ I
.4
have not had time to accommodate my-Self to the English fashions, I breathe

the Spirit of English liberty as freely as I breathe the British air.”
‘‘ Excellent!” replied he, clafping me still cloSer: “You are quite after my own heart. I admire liberty in every shape, but in a female form like thine, I adore it.
“ I am afraid we mistake each other’s

endeavouring to dif-
principles,” Said I, engage myfelf, “ for you appear very fond of confining me against my v/ili:
and I am determined to maintain my
freedom against all encroachers.”
“ But if you should happen to like me as well as I like you, I hope you will ^then deliver yourSelf up to me at once.
without any ties or restraints whatever.” “ You hope to no purpoSe, Sir: for your conditions are not in the least agree-able to me; I defire you, therefore, to

He looked piqued at my reply, tlio* I am pretty Sure he did not know me at that time; but as he was himSelS unmashed, his vanity, I SuppoSe was hurt by the Small attention I paid to his per-Son: he would have had me, no doubt, ‘prodigioussy struck with it.—“ It is not customary for the women in your country,” Said he, “ to refuSe any men, whether they like them or not, unleSs they have any particular views.

“ Perhaps you may be right, but I have. Since I left my native land, accommodated myfelf entirely to the manners of the Englishwomen, who are free in the mostextenSive Senfe of the word: they chuSe and rejedf, agreeably to their inclinations, and are even as little ceremonious

“ Why yes,” replied he, “ our English women are indeed, as well as our English mobs. So devoted to liberty in eveiy shape, that we shall be obliged, for the Safety of the constitution, to make Some considerable
regulations
among the former and the latter, and to lay them both under Salutary restrictions.—You could not, therefore, have arrived here at a worfe time.”
“ As no restrictions of any confequence
are yet in force,” Said I, laughing, “ I shall not trouble mySelf about future proceedings of that tyrannical kind: I shall make So good ufe of my time, as to be wholly indifferent about them.”

Sir ED WARD STANLY
Called at your houSe to-day, but you was—where, I am told you Spend the greatest part of your time—at Mrs. Morden’s. I wanted to talk with you about our women.—MiSs Wroughton is a fine, lively girl: had she not been your choice first, she, certainly, would have been mine.—Yet I am not violently struck with her beauty, or her wit; it is her SenSibility, So strongly expressed in her countenance, in her every feature, in every look, in every gesture which
charms
FEMALE FRAILTY. 185
charms me. Take care, Stanly; if you loSe her you will never get Suck another woman. She loves you, exceedingly: do not be a rogue now, and tempt her too far. As for myfelf, when 1 first Saw MiSs Evelyn I admired her perSon, anti
r
the propriety of her behaviour; but the notion you had put into my head about the neceshty of making a previous trial, made me apprehend that I should not eafily find an opportunity favourable to my defign.—While I was waiting for that opportunity, chance threw me in the way of MiSs Garlies, who has, I think. Sufficiently proved her virtue by the terror she discovered at Beverly’s impertinence.—He meant no harm, I believe: he was only in a romping humour; however, a fine young creature So alarmed
at the freedoms of So handSome, and in-
#
Sinuating a fellow, gives very strong
proofs
i86 FEMALE FRAILTf;
#
proofs of her modesty and discretion: and I am indeed very ready to believe that MiSs Garlies would riot Suffer any man to take improper liberties with her.
1 heartily SubScribe to the following lines.
“ May I ne’er hope where I ne’er deny’d, “ Nor gain a woman willing to be try’d.”
Such a woman MiSs Garlies appears to be, and I intend to cultivate an acquaintance with her. Time will shew the event. She is the friend of your Clara.—They are, both, charming women, but their dilpoSitions are widely different.—I will allow, indeed, that the difference between them may have been occasioned by their different Spheres in life, and • their different educations. MiSs Wroughton was, early, introduced into the gay world, with which she Seems intimately acquainted, and thoroughly

Satisfied. MiSs Garlics, tho’ brought up in a retired way, and thrown at once into pleaSurable Scenes, is neither astonished nor intoxicated: she Seems rather to be fearful of trusting herSelf among a number of giddy people who, really, I believe, more from want of refiedtion, than from a thirst for pleafure, throw themSelves into imprudent Situations. We do not, Stanly, in my opinion, entertain right ideas about pleafure; if we did, we should not So frequently, I imagine amifs where we expedted to find it. By hurrying precipitately to every place wliich promises joy, we are perpetually disappointed: nay, we too often involve ourSelves in dishculties which we cannot Surmount, without combating with ad-

I wish you could derive the Same advantages from philoSophy as I do, Stanly: a little Self-examination now and then, and cloSe thinking would be oS infinite Service to you.—By properly	you would take the best

Mr. Beverly—don’t start, Clara, is here. His uncle. Sir Thomas Hayter, is our neighbour, and has introduced his nephew to our acquaintance.—Had you been with me, you would have Said that I primmed it; but as the rest of the company knew nothing of Mr. Beverly, they were wonderfully delighted with him. He behaved himfelf, indeed, all

I declare I never Saw Beverly condudt himSelf half So much like a man of fenSe, and as a gentleman, in my life: for, as nobody attempted to flirt with him, he was, through mere necessity, obliged to Say Something Solid or entertaining, to make himSelf of any fort of conSequence; and his conversation had the wished-for effecst. Every body listened to him; nobody could be offended with him; all, therefore^ were Satisfied : and I believe I may venture to Say, that all were pleaSed.

We are affured by people who have known Mr. Beverly from his-earliest youth, that he never was guilty of an aXion which ought to lessen him in the eyes of the most valuable part of mankind: we are alfo affured that he has done a number of friendly, and humane things* being, naturally, of a benevolent and generous turn; ready to relieve every creature in distrefs, and to ^shst the industrious with his purSe, his interest, or
his advice.
“ He may be, nevertheless, very blame-
0
able in his behaviour to women.’*
True, my dear: but indeed I have heard it confidently asserted, that he never
took
M
2jt
took half the liberties with women by which his companions impertinently distinguished themSelves: and that his impertinences have only been with women who threw themSelves in his way. As to MiSs Garlies; he owns he was rather too free with but declares he was mistaken in her, and believes she was in him, or she would never have made Such a bustle about a trifle, as he really intended nothing more than a little raillery. This is the account he gives of the matter.: how far it is a just one I cannot determine,
%
but I am willing to think, that they were both under a mistake with regard to each
other—I can, at least, affirm, that he has
*
not yet been guilty of the Slightest deviation from decency—If he had, yon may be Sure he never would have been admitted again.—Xo fay truth, he condudts himSelf with uncommon delicacy.
You

232 FEMALE FRAILTY.
You See, Clara, I have not anSwered your letter in the Same rallying strain r: I have Serioussy taken up my pen in order to convince you, iS poshble, that we are not Such strange out-oS-the-way people here as you imagine us to be, but that we a6l agreeably to the shggestions of reaSon, which ought to be the guide of every body’s behaviour: without Such a guide none will ever be happy themSelvcs, or contribute to the felicity of others. ‘
As to your shewing my letter to Stanly, I think you had better have kept it from his perufal, as it only furnished him with an opportunity to turn it into ridicule: however, his ridicule is thrown away upon me, for I look upon his Severe in his own opinion, no doubt, witty farcaSms, as the highest compliment he could have paid me.—I am pleaSed, to be thought leSs SuSceptible than you, my
friend.
FEMALE FRAILTY, is;
friend, as long as I am not inSenSible to merit: as long as I have a heart feelingly alive to filial tendernefs and virtuous love. I cannot Say more v/ithout expressing my-= Self with a romantic warmth; which I should deem very unbecoming, as I am ambitious of appearing in a domestic quite an un-romantic charaister. However^ tho’ we happen to think differently, Clara, do not imagine that I shfpedt you of be» ing lefs virtuous, lefs delicate than my-Self—But while I am ready to do justice to your Sincerity and uprightnefs, let me caution you again—I cannot caution you too often—against an unguarded behaviour with the man who diScovers a licentious diSpofition.—^With Such a man no woman can be Safe—permit me to add, few women can, with Such a man, be happy. I dare Say, Clara, that when you refiecst, coolly, upon what I have
now

234 FEMALE FRAILTY.
now written to you, you will not find our Sentiments So widely different as you, at first, SuppoSed them to be ; and I am strongly of opinion, that I may still Sub-Scribe mySelf,
With the greatest propriety,
Your real friend, SOPHIA EVELYN.

TO
MiSs E V E L Y N.
O U are, indeed, Sophy, I must Say again, a violent prude; but then you at the Same time diScover So much good nature, and mix So much lenity with your Severity when you cenSure your
friend
FEMALE FRAILTY. 235
friend for Some particular failings, that I cannot possibly be offended with you. But do you know that I am just now in . a humour to give up every thing to you ? Stanly has made me quite angry with him—I believe, indeed, that he has, like Beverly, been Spoilt by his conneftionsr, yet if he is not to be reformed, ! must, I fear, entirely difcard him. Fear, did I Say ?—I repeat the word—I feel that I iove him immoderately—hut I must tell you all.—The day before yesterday he took Such monstrous liberties with me, that it was with difficulty I Saved my Self.
“ Why would you expofe yourSelf to Such treatment?”
Dosht chide me, Sophy.—He was sh bewitchingly amiable, that I was almost deprived of the power of refisting him I should rather fay I was too much pleaS-ed with his fooling, and did not fuffi-
ciently
236 FEMALE FRAILTY.
ciently conSider what I was about.
A moment’s refiedion, however, restored me to my reaSon, and I Summoned up resolution enough to drive him from me.—^Oh! Sophy! did ymu but know what it has cost my heart, you would pity me.—You will tell me, perhaps, that I ought not to. make Such an imprudent conSession after what you have Said, but I cannot play the hypocrite.
I feel too keenly to add any more at prefent.

LETTER the Forty-third.
Sir EDWARD STANLY
T O
Lord BEAUFORD
Have adtually lost her, I believe: and just at the very moment when I was within an inch of being completely
happy. Never was there .a more inviting creature.
Mrs. Morden being engaged to make Some viSits, Clara, at my request, feigned a head-ach, that she might be left at home.—I cannot enter into particulars at preSent—I have her in chace now ; but she was almost expiring in my arms, overwhelmed with the most melting ten-
dernefs

derneSs—-at that instant, my evil or her
I
^ood genius interpoSed, rouSed her Srom. the delicious languor into which she had fallen, and gave her strength enough to repel all my attacks with a Spirit which I little expeDed ; in short, I was utterly unable to carry my point, and yet I verily believe, that if I had perSevered vi-goroufiy I should have won the day.
Last night 1 hurried after her to Ra-nelagh: there I found her encircled by coxcombs of all Sorts, fools of all denominations; but the most formidable fellow was an elegant little raScal, an Adonis—who, either totally ignorant of his own attradions, or dazzled by the lustre of her charms, plied her with the utmost assiduity: his attentions were un-
remitted the
whole evening.
and his
behaviour most flatteringly relpedbful; at the Same time that it was in the highest

degree tender and infinuating. She must be more than woman if she does not listen tp this new admirer, if she admits him to a tete a tete—What a confounded blow just when I was—had I but proved viflorious, I had been for ever Sure of her—as long, at least, as I choSe to be constant—now—it is her turn to triumph.
So cool. So indifferent. So distradledly civil—Oh! the devil take all politeness

I Say, between the Sexes, elpecially when the woman is like Clara Wroughton. ReSpeft should be confined to the old and ugly: and yet this lovely, blushing^ creature will infist upon it, that her polite behaviour is necessary, in order to keep up her conSequence, I SuppoSe. But I v:ill not leave her in this exulting fituation ; if I do, I shall deferve to loSe her.
Yours, &c.

OUR last letter deServes iny best thanks; Sophy: it was a very friendly one; equally friendly was your invitation, but I cannot accept of it at preSent. I have, a tliouSand engagement.3 upon my hands.—A new lover, child : only the Sweetest fellow in the world: and yet—but I must tell you a little about him : Lord Southern is the man, the'eldest Son of the Earl of T---:

However, fince Lord Southern became acquainted with me, he is, apparently, very curious; So curious, indeed, that if he had not been my professed lover, I should call him the most troublefome impertittent breathing. He follows us,
he watches us, he listens.

Last night, at Ranelagh, while I, in better Spirits than uSual, was laughing at Something Lord Southern had told me, I happened to turn my head to Speak to Lady Jane Selby, and Saw Stanly engaged in her party.
Looking full in my face, he fell into the most virulent invedlives against thole women, who flirt with every man who comes in their way.

forget him.
I fear, Sophy, with you, that there is no trusting him. I do not, indeed, know whether he wishes to be
received again.
There is a great deal
more anger than love in his eyes at present: his frowns are absolutely inSup-

Southern was exceedingly officious the whole evening; So assiduous. So attentive to my every look and every motion—he Seemed to breathe for me alone. But it will not do, Sophy, as I Said

AM half distracsted with doubts and fears: this Southern will certainly get her. He is Soberly, Serioufiy in love with
her.—Who, indeed, is not ? yet I, Sometimes, fancy that I lee nothing of the tender kind in her for him. She Smiles, and she is civil: but will Smiles alone Satisfy the ardent lover ? Will unmeaning civility content the man whole whole Soul is devoted to Such a woman as Clara Wroughton ?

She is the more to be valued—and I ought to love her with redoubled tenderneSs, for an alteration in her behaviour to me So much to her honour.—But she will not fee me; she will not Ipeak to me—she will undoubt-, edly listen to this Southern in time, and as undoubtedly give him her hand whether she loves him or not.—His family, his rank, his fortune, and his connections are all powerful advocates for him; and the world—especially the female world—will think her mad to reje<5l So defirable an alliance. She will, therefore, in all probability, fell herfelf purely to be thought to have adled 2i prudent ■part., rather than give herSelf to the man who really loves her, who doats on her; to the

man whom Jhe loves.—Yes—she certainly did love me—she, possibly,, may Jiill love me, notwithstanding the beauty of her Adonis. He is strangely handSome, and when he gazes eagerly at her with his long languishing eyes, he puts me in mind of thofe lovers in romances who are drawn extravagantly beautiful. You fee, Harry, my reading is not confined to Serious history, and matters-of-fact books.' The truth is, I have peruSed a great many deledlable stories invented by the tribe of fanciful authors.—But to the point. Clara may be fully SenSible of the perfonal charmiS of her new admirer, and yet prefer me; and if she does prefer me, I shall have great reaSon to triumph. I once heard a very plain but very agreeable woman, Speaking of her lover, fay, “ I am doubly obliged to him, for he has not only given me his heart, but beauty

Excellent! that’s
a fign she has no

I shall be glad to See how you both appear in the characters of man and wife: charadters not very frequently Supported with a striking propriety. I con-

feSs I have not the Smallest doubts concerning your behaviour ; but I cannot help entertaining Some apprehenSions with regard to my friend Beverly’s. He never, I must own. Seemed to me Suffi-ciently qualified to a6l the hushand in a
becoming manner.—^Now I think Lord
«
Southern would be quite the thing, be-cauSe he would idolize his wife. He appears to have an extreme tendernefs of heart; and is certainly formed, by the foftneSs of his difpofition, to pity even thofe whom he cannot love: thofe whom he admires, he adores. And yet, Sophy, it is not in my power to give
my
heart: I should rather Say, it is notin my power to take it from that dear deceiver, who has but too firmly fixed it for his own, I fear, for ever.—Well; Since it must be So, I, from this moment, Set all men at defiance.—It is my

without encouraging a Serious thought
about any of them.
I would not, however, have you ima

SalSe hopes, who deServes better treat-

my opinion, entitled to the Sairest treat-

He Sighed, and was Silent for Some time.—He then Said,— “ If you are of the heavenly dilpofition you appear to be in my eyes, MiSs Wroughton, you will not refuSe me the favour I am going to Solicit. Tho’ you cannot bleSs me with your love,” continued he, fighing more deeply, “ can you deny me the next felicity, your friendship.'^—You may Surely venture to receive me as your friend: I shall not abuSe your kindneSs ; nor give the man, whom you render the happiest of his Sex, reafon to be in the least alarmed on my account,
I Smiled—and not in the most for-

My
FEMALE FRAILTY. 23
My Lord Saw nothing forbidding in my behaviour.—He Seized my hand, and with a reSpedlful, yet impassioned air, pressed it to his lips.
I did not draw it back in a hurry. The poor fellow, I thought, deServed a little indulgence: for Surely no man ever received his fentence with a luorc
g concern.
Nov/, perhaps, you., with your stridl modesty, may imagine.
that I ought
not to have let him mumbled my hand So.—-But, indeed, child, you are quite out. One’s hand is nothing at all, of no Sort of conSequence, while one’s heart
IS
free.
There lies all the danger: and

Have hitherto met with nothing but
disappointments.
On my arrival at the town nearest to Mr. Garlies’s estate, I was informed that he and his family were gone to make a fortnight’s viSit to a Mr. Forbes’s, about twenty miles farther northward. I curbed my impatience as well as I could, and amuSed myfelf with riding to fee every thing that was most curious about the country; and, to Say truth,

made Forbes-Place in my way; not advancing too near, however: but I heartily wish now that I had advanced; as matters might not have been carried So far, to my great uneafineSs: for, the first night Mr. Garlies returned home, I heard that he had received a very advantageous offer for his daughter from Sir Arthur Coningham, a young Baronet, with a good charadter, and a large estate : yet, as I did not alfo hear that the match was concluded, I went, the next day, and introduced mySelf as a perSon who had the pleafure of being acquainted with Mils Garlies in Lon-
and deSired the favour of beino-

me to be feated. She looked exceed-ingly disconcerted : she made a. great effort to recover herSelf; and, at length, got courage to tell her father the little piece of Service I had fortunately done her. By communicating that intelligence to him, she occafioned an irrime-diate change in his behaviour to me.' He then welcomed me in the warmest and most hofpitable manner. The dear girl’s countenance immediately brightened up, and, upon the strength of the alteration in her father’s carriage, ventured, tho’ with a v/inning modesty, to enter into a onverSation with me.
Mr. Garlies pressed me to dine with him, and I conSented. He then ashed me to walk over his gardens, as the weather was not too warm. On my
f
deSiring Mifs Garlies to favour us with her company, she looked at her father
for
/
FEMALE FRAILTY. 29
for his approbation: and immediately went to fetch her bonnet.
While she was abfent, I availed my-Self of that opportunity to expatiate
upon the charms of her perSon and her
■*
manners, the last of which had fixed me irrevocably hers; tho* I forbore to mention my Sentiments upon that Subjedl, till I could hear her Sentiments concerning me.—Fortune favoured my wishes.
t
Mr. Garlies, having been Sent for by a perSpn who came about bufineSs to him, left me with his daughter, bidding her
to entertain me;
and adding.
that he
would Send her mother to assist iier.
I Seized that interesting moment, and made a full declaration of my passion.— “ I came down, MiSs Garlics, on pur-pofe to ash your father’s conSent to vi~ fit ypu.”'

Her fair face glowed with blushes t she threw down, her pretty eyes, but w.as Silent.
I pressed her to tell me, if she had any objedtion to my defign ; adding, by way of apology for the abruptneSs of my declaration, that I was too Sincerely defirous of making her happy, to attempt to prejudice Mr. Garlics in my
Savour, till I knev/ her Sentiments.

She still blushed, but thanked me;
and, after a little hefitation. Said,
44
My
father’s pleaSure, my Lord, has ever
I
been mine : and I think it my duty
to comply with whatever he cstoofes,

for me.”
But if Mr Garlies’s choice,” replied I, “ should not accord with your inclination, will you, Madam, rather
venture to be unhappy, than diffent
from

from him in a point in which your feli-^ city is deeply concerned
“ As my father will never adviSe me to follow any meafures, my Lord,” replied file, “ but what he thinks most likely to make me happy: and as he must, necessarily, know a great, deal more of the world.than I do, I shall run a very Small riSque, I imagine, by Submitting to his pleaSure.”
“ So good a daughter, MiSs Garlics,” anSwered I, “ will, undoubtedly, make an excellent wife: yet I must confeSs I should be happier in being freely chofen by you, than only by your father. And as I am encouraged by you to endeavour to obtain your father’s confent, I fliali trouble you no farther at prefent; I shall content myfelf with hoping, from your encouraging carriage, that you would give me the preference to any of

She looked most agreeably embarraff-ed; but as Mrs. Garlies came up to us at that moment, she could not return any anSwer.
Mrs
you
may believe me when I tell you that her daughter very much reSembles her in her
perSon.-—Having been informed by her hushand, I SuppoSe, of my rank in life,
she treated me with tlie greatest polite-neSs.
I Spent the day at Garlies-Place, and staid till the evening was very far advanced, in hopes of getting a moment to Speak to Nancy alone; but, as other company came in, I found it impossible to 3.S: agreeably to my wishes; and So I left them, after having told Mr. Garlies (who waited on me to the door) that

He politely thanked me for the honour I had done him, in making choice of his daughter; adding, that he was Sorry his word was already given to Sir Arthur Coningham.
“ And not with MiSs Garlies’s approbation, Sir?” cried I, eagerly, with emotions which I could not conceal.

I have got my Spirits up again a little.
f
Stanly has taken lodgings at Kew, and throws himSelf, perpetually, in my way-, but I have not yet taken more notice of him than I could well help.—I will own, however, that I have been violently tempted to shew a little consideration for him, on his Seeming to humble him-

Self exceedingly. Yet I am afraid of going too far; and, as I do not intend to receive him as I did before he offended me, I think it better to be rather distant, and reServed to him ; and I believe Southern thinks So too;. for he is ever cloSe at my elbow, and candudls himSelf in every reSped like a friend;

fuppofe that you, with your rigid prin-

There is a fierceneSs in his frowning brow which makes me imagine that he is trying to intimidate me; but I am not So Soon frightened. He will be a thousand times more likely to Soften me with tendernefs, than with refentment.
Lord Southern has fuch a quantity of tendernefs in his difpoSition, that he is, I think, completely qualified to shine as a friend, tho’ he may be Sometimes in too melting a strain for a lover.

His title and estate have, I dare Say, made as deep an impression upon her as his figure and addreSs. If I really thought she had done as much execution on him as he has on her, I should not be able to write So chearfully: but I look upon Stanly as one of thoSe men who cannot
exist without an attachment of Some
•<
kind; and who dangles after women merely to kill time.—Yet, behaviour appears to me in this light, he may not be, atstually. SoiiarmleSs: for I have often heard both you and Mrs. Evelyn Say, that a woman cannot be more prejudiced than by being much talked of. MiSs Bushy, therefore, is in Some danger, as all Twickenham is in a bustle about her. Stanly is coming continually to breakfast at her father’s, a man whom nobody knows.-—Some people think he is worth monev *, others, that he has no

fortune at all, but that he intends to make a good deal of his handSome daughter. The whole family—father, mother, daughter, and couSin—an ugly girl who Serves as a foil to MiSs Bushy—are persons of no education: They certainly shew very little knowledge of the world, by the transports which they diScover on Sir Edward’s intimacy with them.
We happened to be near thein last Sunday night in Richmond gardens. One would, really, have imagined they had never Spoken to a Baronet before: it was Sir Edward at every Syllable: and I dare fay the girl, if she could any way draw him in to marry her, would be almost out of her wits to hear herSelf called My Lady, and Your Ladyship, without bestowing a thought upon the charming fellow who had given her thofe titles. But Stanly cannot, poshbly, tie himSelf
for

for life to a creature without any taste or Sentiment. He may, perhaps, be struck with her perSon a little, just by way of variety; yet I think she must, upon a nearer acquaintance, difgust him. There is no anfwering, however, for men: they have the strangest, the most unaccountable fancies. Sometimes—but then they are Seldom lasting.
I am rejoiced, believe me, my dear Sophy, to find you are So happy: I am alSo much pleaSed to find that Beverly, after having been So very volatile, is become a Serious, constant, tender huS-band. If one fickle fellow can change So greatly for the better, why not another ^ I begin to have Some hopes of Stanly ; should he be converted into a new man, I do not fee, I confeSs, why he may not be received by a woman of chara^er, as well as Beverly, You will

tell me, probably, that Beverly never attempted to take thoSe liberties with you^ which Stanly has taken with me: but if a man commits an error once in his life, must he never be forgiven i Such a way of thinking is a very' Severe one; and it is, in my opinion, repugnant both to reaSon and religion: and the truly religious are never unforgiving. Were I Sure that Stanly would return, and behave like a man of honour, could I rejedl him But it is not the expeda-tion of his return which prevents me from doling with Lord Southern’s generous propofals : the truth is, I cannot

FTER having fixed upon a good fine black-eyed girl, in order to
carry
FEMALE FRAILTY.
carry on my Scheme against Clara Wroughton, I began to ply her pretty cloSely in all places in which vre should be, most probably, obServed; concluding, that, if we were but Seen together, Clara would Soon hear of us. But, whether she fancied, from the perfonal dif-ference between the ohyedt of my choice and herfelf, that I was oxily playing the lover, whether she was really become quite eafy about me, or whether she had absolutely determined to marry Southern I cannot Say: I only know that I found her entirely unaffected by the procedure which would, I thought, have given no Small disturbance to her mind. This disappointment chagrined me confider-ably: being diSgusted too by the excess-five fondnesss of my Dulcinea, and the Surfeiting civilities of her father and mother, I determined to look out for a
goddefs
64 FEMALE FRAILTY.
goddeSs more Suitable to my taste. Fortune Soon favoured me, by throwing Lady Lucy H. in my way: her mother, the CounteSs, came down to Kew for the air, and for the recovery of her Spirits.
I made an acquaintance with Lady Lucy on horSeback, in one of my morning rides, and find her much fitter for my purpofe than MiSs Bushy was : she is very delicate in her form, and quite the woman of fashion in her manners. I have carried her twice out in my phaeton. The last time, I met, in Bushy park. Lord Southern driving Clara in his whilky. Would you believe itI was So disconcerted at the rencontre, that I was within an ace of overturning my companion, who, though highly pleaSed with her airing, could hardly refrain from fcreaming with terror.

We were, indeed, in So much danger,
that Southern, like a man of gallantry, jumped out‘ of his own vehicle, and
came to assist my Servants in holding the horfes, which, being young and Spirited, could, with difficulty, be kept frora flying out of the track they were in.
I thanked Lord Southern for his po-liteneSs and humanity, and, at any other time, should have hurried to Clara, who fat alone in the chair, and looked like an angel, full of lovelinefs and goodnefs. But instead of running to entertain her, in the abSbnce of her Adonis, I bussed mySelf about my own companion, and endeavoured to laugh her out of her fears; taking care, at the fame time, to appear, by proper looks and gestures, as if I was faying an immenSe number of tender things to her.—And yet Clara’s features—-for I every now and then
approached

approached her, pretending to See if the reins of my horSes were in order—were most inflexibly compofed. — Well! if she is refolved to perflst in this rigid, unrelenting humour, she may live to repent : for I muji amuSe my Self with the first agreeable girl who comes in my way; and this Lady Lucy looks as if she would do; that is, for the prefent: She can never be like Clara; but Clara is changed.—I have nothing to do now, but to follow her example.

There is a Something which Sweetly relieves us under our diSquietudes, while we are diSclofing them to a ssncere friend. I have, therefore, taken up my pen, oppressed with Sorrow, to inform you that Stanly is irrecoverably lost: He has, at length, met with the very

I had no fears about MiSs Bushy; fix could only, I knew, be the favourite of
an hour. Lady Lucy will, probably, be a reigning one.
We met, accidentally, in Bushy park t’other day. After numberleSa Solicitations, I had consented to be drove by Lord Southern in his whiSky. Sir Edward, like a Superior being, came driving down upon, us, in his phaeton, with Lady Lucy.

Stanly jumped out, and addressed him-Self politely to my Lord, but took not the least notice of me; returned to his companion, who feemed half dead with fear, and Soothed her in the tenderest manner. I experienced, indeed, the Same treatment, but not from him,y from Lord Southern, who, feeing me ready to faint, begged me to let him go to the first houfe, and fetch Something to revive me; expreshng what, I believe, he really felt, a great deal of concern at the disorder which I could not conceal; tho’, to Spare my confufion, he affeded not to perceive the cauSe of it.
There is no deScribing what I then felt, what I now feel. I am ashamed of my folly—if it be a folly to prefer a

As Lady Lucy was the only woman of quality there that night, I led her
to begin the dance.

Sir EDWARD STANLY.
AM in the most diSagreeable Situation imaginable; I am convinced that I am preferred by Mist G arlies to Sir Arthur, and yet I have no hopes of ever getting her into my posseshon.
It was with great difficulty that I discovered her partiality for me.—After having employed my time chiefly in endeavouring to find out the places she frequented, in which I might not only See
her

her—the fight oS her only would not Satisfy me—but stand a chance of hearing her fentiments about me, and of discovering what her feelings were on my ac-
count
After having made feveral fruit-
O
lefs efforts, to* gratify my curiofity, fortune, at last, befriended me.
As. I constantly repaired to all the em virons about Mr. Garlies’s estate, I was-happy enough, one day, to behold his daughter in the park,, walking fiowly up and down in a penSive manner.
I was over the boundary in a moment,
which was only a low paling,, and. came-
»
upon her by furprife.
She started, coloured^ like crimSon,; and. pronounced my name in faulterincr
accents.
I endeavoured, at the lame-time, to compofe her fluttered Spirits, and in-

treated her to tejl me if Sir Arthur was

really the man of her choice.
“ My father’s choice niust be mine.
my Lord.”
That reply she repeated.
#
‘Undoubtedly,” anSweredI; “butonly tell me, would you chuSe to give your hand to Sir Arthur Coningham, if your father deSired you to a6t agreeably to your inclination? This is the last queS-tion, Mifs Garlies, with which I shall, perhaps, ever trouble you; for if you are refolved to accept of Sir Arthur’s offer, I will immediately quit this part of the country, and try, with the assistance of new obje<5ts and Scenes, to banish you from my thoughts; tho’ the idea of your being destined to another’s arms, will, I fear, totally destroy my peace.

For Several moments her Spirits were

my Sentiments upon this Subjefl—I must obey my father^—his choice, as I Said before, must be mine.-—But I shall never,”
added she, with a gentle figh, “ resteCc

“ Do not afk me any more questions, my Lord,” replied she, blushing exceS-fively: “ it is very improper for me to hear any more.”
“ There can be no impropriety,” Said I, “ in your giving me all the eaSe in your power.”
“ And shall you be happier,” replied she, “ if I fay that my father’s approbation of your addresses would have been quite agreeable to me, when I know that you can never obtain it ?”
“ I shall, indeed,” anfwered I, preshng her hand eagerly—■“ Tour approbation will be So transporting, that it will enable me to Surmount all difficulties.”

A faint Smile just gleamed over her

boSom. I then began to entertain hopes of bringing her to a more particular conSeshon: but at that interesting moment, the appearance of Some company, making hasty advances towards us, threw her Ipirits into a violent flutter. She broke from me abruptly, and begged me to leave the park immediately. I pleaded hard for another interview, but to no purpofe. She flew, like a fearful fawn, to avoid the approaching groupe, and Soon concealed herfelf in a little grove: not thinking herfelf lecure there, however, she would hurry on to another place, and fell over the trunk of a tree which lay acrofs the path, and was not oblerved by her.
As Soon as I Saw her down, I quickly, regardleSs of any confequences, reached the Spot, and arrived just time enough to raife her in my arms.
She

She was pale, almost breathlefs, and could not, at first. Support herSelS; she was alSo So very much shocked at her Situation, that she cried out

“ Let us go to him together,’* anSwered I, “ and endeavour—^but first tell me where you are hurt .?**
“No

“No where—no where—I was a great
deal more Srightened.”
However, when she attempted to walk, she complained of her Soot. ASter a number of perSuafions, I prevailed on her to let me wait on her to her father’s: yet, tho’ she was obliged to rest upon my arm, she would not make one encouraging reply to all the: tender things I Said to her (butl plainly Saw that they were not diSpleaSing to her;) So that I am convinced, that nothing but her inability to walk
ft
without my affistance could have induced her to let me go home with her.
Mr. Garlies did not diScover much Surprise at the fight of me., or much concern at his daughter’s accident. To shield her from his anger, of which she Seemed to be apprehenSive,' I told him, that having
Seen her fall over a trunk of a tree in the park, while I was looking into it, I
got

replied,, that his word had been givjsn;
•>
which was of more conSequence to him than any thing I could offer;. and that, as his daughter could bav-e no reaSonable obiedtion to Sir. Arthur, he was Sure he would never break it.—“I am obliged to you, however, my Lord,” continued he, “ for having taken care of my daughter, if she has received any hurt ; but as she is engaged, to Sir. Arthur, your following her wiU not,. I think, be of advantage to either of you.”
Calm as you imagine me to be, his provoking steadineSs upon So interesting an occafion, when all my happineSs was

- I Sometimes think—tho’ I can never Subscribe to	principles—that I should
be far. happier if I was Such a vrild, unfettled fellow as yourSelf, perpetually roving from one girl to another—^But it is not in my nature to be Suddenly pleaSed with the woman who happens to fall in my way, nor to quit her, in a hurry, who has deeply engaged my attention.—No—our Sentiments with regard to women are So oppofite, that I often

likely to strike up an accommodation between us.
We were all at the play houSe at Richmond last night. Clara was in company with a very agreeable girl whoSe father lives at Twickenham. This girl would have been distinguished, by me before, bad I not had So many affairs upon my hands. She is more elegant than hand-fome, and has a remarkable delicacy in her- carriage. She looked rather like a pretty attendant on Clara, than as her equal. No body can equal Clara; and I do not believe that Emma Melville ever thought of putting herSelf upon a par with her; to the credit of her understanding be it mentioned.
Lord Southern attended them, and was as uSual attentive to Clara, tho’ very polite to her companion. I was with Lady Lucy. Clara, I thought, now and then
stole

So lovely indeed was her appearance, that I could Scarce keep my eyes from gazing at her. Once or twice I forgot that Lady Lucy was Speaking to me.

my tale. My

what is past, and my future proSpefls are extremely animating.—You shall hear.
Finding that one woman was coying it, I determined to make the most of the other; and So 1 pushed my fortune with Lucy.—It will be needlefs to tell
you

you that I Succeeded. She was, indeed. So ready, that I had very little trouble, and, in truth, not a great deal of pleasure, in the affair. How^ever, as I had
»
no other woman at That time upon my hands, and as she was a SoSt, gentle thing, and really fond of me, I could not treat her with contempt.—When a woman does all she can to oblige me, it is not in my nature to be cruel to her.
While I was Sauntering with Lady Lucy, this morning, in the meadows,
f
she leant upon my arm, and I played the fool with her, as one is very apt to do when one is alone with a fine sirl

fawned upon me, and Seemed to be exceedingly glad to See me.
Lady Lucy, stooping to careSs him, stumbled, and v/ould have fallen down, I believe, if I had not caught her in my arms in a tender manner, to Save her; for the fond fimpleton looked full of gratitude and love. I was, therefore, diSpoSed to Say Something kind to her.
By this time Clara was near enough to See what we were about. When she pasted us she looked pale, and extremely agitated ; yet inexpressibly lovely.
I bowed.—-She honoured me with a
curtSy,
though a flight one.
PleaSed,
however, with this proof of her return-ing-civility at least, I turned to look after her. Her figure was too elegant not to fix the eye which it had attraded.

to raiSe her. She was fainting; the image of death.—I cried aloud, “ Lady Lucy, MiSs Wroughton is in a fit: run. Call for help.”
Lucy, frightened at the SuddenneSs of the accident, and at the dying looks of Clara, hurried towards the houfe, leaving me alone with the dear, distressed creature.—Having lifted her up, and laid her head upon my boSom, I pressed her hands in mine; but finding her still inSenfible, I strove, by numberieSs warm kisses, to restore her to life.
At last she opened her eyes, but clofed them again immediately, as if on purpoSe to give me full liberty to do what I pleaSed. I made a good uSe of the moments of indulgence, and not only kissed her forehead,, eyes, and hair, but her charming, pouting lips, vrarm with returning life, returning love. I

kissed her till I perceived her quite reco^ vering: and then thought it proper to deSist, Sor fear of a Second altercatiorir Scene : yet I have known a good Scolding bout Sometimes attended wsth very liberal permissions.—However, not being altogether Sure of my ground here, and being really anxious about Clara’s recovery, I endeavoured to Sooth her with a thouSand tender Speeches, and Soft pressures of her hands in mine, and by straining her with ardor to my bo-Som.—I am Sure she was not diSpleaSed with my fond endeavours.

FEMALE FRAILTY. 105
This was the very thing I wanted.
I Solemnly Swore, that Lady Lucy was nothing to me; telling her, at the Same time, that having been thrown from her-SelS, by her coldneSs to me, I had met with Lady Lucy by accident; that I could not help Speaking to a woman Sometimes ; and that her Ladyship had taken advantage oS my politeneSs to her, to affe<ft a familiarity v/hich was quite un-neceffary, as it would never make any impression upon me, who was, and ever should be, whether she was kind or cruel to me, hers alone.
She fighed, but made no reply. Then, rifing from the ground, she Suf-. fered me to take her arm, which I, immediately, put under mine, and insisted upon leading her home.
While I was leading her home, I, anxioussy, enquired into the caule of

her Sudden diSorder; expressed the ten-derest concern, and intreated her, with So much earnestneSs, to be restored to the blessings I had once enjoyed, that I believe she knew not what to Say to me.
Taking advantage oS her Silence, I repeated my request to be admitted to See her again as uSual; Swearing that I would never again abuSe her kindneSs to me.—-In short, I told her, plainly, at last, that I neither could, nor would live without her.
She then appeared to be quite Softened, but only replied, “ What will my

Lady Lucy was, indeed, at that moment, advancing towards us.—I faw her with Some of the neighbouring Servants whom she had met with, bringing cordials and Salts.

Yet I felt SenSations So exquiSite-ly delicious, that I cannot refiedl upon them without the highest raptures, nor can I forbear to wish for the repetition of them with the utmost impatience.

Went armed for conquest ; and I & far Succeeded, that she can hardly deny me any thing.
I dressed mySelf with uncommon elegance and precision, and flew on the
wings
FEMALE FRAILTY. 117
"rings of love and expectation to the appointed place.
I adt'Ually trembled. So much was I agitated. I could hardly unlock the door. She was, doubtleSs, as eager as mySelf; yet she had contrived to'heighten my impatience, by concealing herSelf in the most retired part of the garden. In a little shady recefs, at the bottom of a ferpendne walk, was she Seated. A more lovely figure cannot well be conceived. She had on a white Iprigged mussin gown over a pale pink petticoat; a pair of white Sattin flippers covered
I
the prettiest feet imaginable: a fine laced hood was just turned over her beautiful glossy hair, and a black laced tereSa was careleSsLy thrown acroSs her Snowy bo-fom. She had no gloves on. She Sat, in a languishing attitude, Supporting her

head with one oS the whitest hands in the univerSe.
On my approach she raiSed her head. An inviting Sniile beamed in her lovely face, and a gentle Sigh forced itSelS Srom her panting boSom.
I Sat down by her, and pleaded my cauSe So Successfully, that she conSented to receive me as uSual, when she had prepared her aunt for my reception, wlio would not, fne told me, having expreff-ed her approbation of her condud, be brought over eafily.
“ Let me fee you here, then,” Said I,

“ till every thing is lettled.”
She half refufed, yet more than half complied with, my request. Where is the woman who can breathe a denial to her insinuating lover in the moment of re conciliation ?
However,
FEMALE FRAILTY. 119
However, I would not be too preff-ing. The true voluptuary will bear the delay of his pleaSure, if that delay is likely to heighten the relish of it. I, therefore, made my paffion keep time with her inclination; by So doing, I gained a thouSand little advantages which love prompted her to allow me, and which, had I eagerly attempted to Seize before she was willing to permit them,
I might have created new SuSpicions in her mind. Befides, by thus playing with her, I inflamed her passions, and threw her quite off her guard. She indulged me in a number of little freedoms, becaufe she did not believe I would preSume to take great ones. I confeSs, however, that I could Scarce keep mySelf within bounds, while my hand wandered over her face, encircled her neck, and played with the ringlets

She Smiled, charmingly Smiled, and Suffered me to Snatch a number of impassioned kisses : yet all the time llie was trying to put me by with— ‘‘ Don’t you—don’t you—indeed I will not let you.”—Yet, before we parted, she Said “ But you will come to-morrow j won’t you ? don’t stay after Seven.”
I, certainly, do not intend to be pun(5lual; becauSe I hope that the pains of expedtation will sharpen her appetite, and that she will be ready to Spring into my arms: and then—the game will be all over.

tended by a Servant. I joined her imme-diately, tho’ she Seemed Srighted and un-caSy: and by her uneaSineSs diminilhed the pleaSure I should have enjoyed in conversing with her.
The man kept a good way behind, out oS reSpedt; and we Spoke, So low that he could not, possibly, hear what we Said.
I pleaded hard to be accepted in the room of Sir Arthur. She at last owned, that, if her father would but conSent, fhe should not heSitate a moment to prefer me to Hm.
This, I thought, was a confiderable point gained. My next step was to endeavour to prevail on her to go off with me, as her father had no objedlion to me, as he was only Scrupulous about the breach of his promiSe.—“Your father,
my dear Nancy,’* continued I,
‘ may make

“ It is too great a riSque,” replied she. “ I can never conSent to it.”
k
“ I must bid adieu, then,” anSwered I, “ to all Selicity.”
She looked earnestly at me: she Saw

alk you, my Lord, whether a man can, possibly, be Safe with Such a woman, who, after having taken a step So exceedingly indiScreet, So inconsistent with her duty. So incompatible with her reputation, may be liable to commit a Second indiscretion of the fame nature, if Ihe happens to meet with a man artful enough to perSuade her.^’*
The word artful was Spoken with a particular emphafis, and accompanied with a look So- strongly expreshve of her meaning, that I was charmed with her prudence, tho^ she plunged me into de-Spair by it.—I endeavoured, however, to frame a reply Sufficient to refute her arguments, tho’ at the Same time, I really thought I was wrong in attempting to
cor-

corrupt principles which were in the highest degree laudable.—Her principles I could not shake, but I esteemed her, I loved her the more Sor being un-SucceSsful.
In the next place, I endeavoured to prevail on her to promiSe me not to marry Sir Arthur.—You are not obliged, my
Garlies,” Said I, “ to give
MiSs
your hand to a man whom you do not love.—Neither duty nor honour demand Such a Sacrifice, nor ought your father to require it.—No father ought to require Such a Sacrifice from his child. By refusing Sir Arthur, therefore, my dear
Nancy, you will pave the way for my admission in his room; he will, probably, quit you in difgust, and Mr. Garlies will then, perhaps, conSent to my happinefs.” She shook her head, and begged me to leave her, as a longer conversation, if
G3
her
126 FEMALE FRAILTY.
her father heard of it, might be disapproved of by him.
It was with difficulty I complied; I wished to gain her assent to what I had requested, but I could not get her to give me the defired fatisfadtion; and I confefs 1 discovered great diScontent at her behaviour; imagining that as I had abandoned my first Scheme, which was, indeed, indefenfible, she would not have Scrupled to gratify me by her compliance with my Second propoSal.
She affedhed to take not the least notice of the determination I had made to forget her: and we parted with the utmoft indifference on both Sides.—Chagrined at my disappointment, I reSolved to leave the country the next morning; but how vain are the reSoIves of a man deSperately in love! I could not bear to go while fhe remained unmarried; I lingered in the
neieh-
FEMALE FRAILTY. 127
neighbourhood; Sometimes strolling to one place. Sometimes to another; every where hearing, to my extreme diSquiet, that preparations were making for the marriage between my Nancy and Sir Arthur. I, therefore, concluded that she had confented to marry Coningham. Yet I could not leave the country.
My chagrin and my diSquiet injured my health: I became restleSs, and all over disordered. My illneSs terminated in a fever. My Servants Sent for a phyfi-
cian, and I grew better: yet I had not
%
left my bed when they told me, by way of affording me Some amuSement, that
there was to be a monthly ball the follow-

Thinking, at that instant, that I should have a good opportunity to fee my Nancy, at least, once more, while she remained MiSs Garlies,. I roSe, and dressed

mySelf, tho’ little able to endure the fatigue of putting on my cloaths.
By the time I entered the assembly room I was hardly capable of Supporting mySelf upon my legs: yet my eyes immediately went in Search of MiSs Garlies.
I foon discovered her; she was not more remarkable for the beauty of her perSon than for the melancholy which Seemed to have taken entire possession of her.
Her mother Sat on one fide of her, and a young lady on the other; both of them Seemed to uSe their utmost endeavours to rouze her from the deje<5Uon in which she was buried: she was certainly inattentive to every thing about her.
Her companion, at last, pointed me out to her. She turned her languishing eyes towards me with looks in which
Surprise and concern were strongly painted:.
FEMALE FRAILTY, izj
\
ed: and she expressed her emotions by only not shrieking.
I Saw no m6re.—The Satigue which I endured on being out of my bed. So very improperly, I muft Say, increaSed my in-diSpoSition; and my feelings, in conSe-quence of MiSs Garlies’s cruel behaviour, quite overwhelmed me; nor was I SenSi-x ble of what passed, till I found mySelf encircled by a great number of people. Among them was my dear Nancy in a pitying attitude, her hands were clafped together, and her eyes fixed mournfully upon me, while tears rolled in large drops down her lovely face.
I was So much affedSed by her distreSs, which was, I Soon perceived, on my account, that I thought no more of my own disorder.
Just when I was beginning to addreSs mySelf to her in the most tender strain.

She then turned to comSort her daiish-
D
ter.—“ Go and fit down, my dear,” Said she, “ my Lord is a great deal better.”
Nancy fighed as if she doubted her mother’s intelligence; but Mrs. Garlies’s gentle pity, and perSuafive manner, had the effedt which it ought to have had upon her daughter. I mySelf was particularly touched at her maternal behaviour: I Saw, at the fame time, with unspeakable pleaSure, that my Nancy copied her mother very exactly, and that they had, both, the Sweetest diSpoSitions
in

in the world.—I had, however, but little time to admire tliem, Sor I was led to a carriage, and attended by a gentleman who discovered great care and politeneSs about me.
The next day I received enquiries after my health from Mr. and Mrs. Garlies.
In return, I examined the messenger very cloSely about his young lady.—He told me, that it was feared she had a disorder upon her Spirits.
Thus
rather
than break his word with Sir Arthur, tho’ given before he had conSulted her^ will run the rifque of lofing a most amiable and dutiful child, to increafe my affliftion.

convince you that I am in the right, let me tell you, that no man was ever more Solidly, more Substantially blest than I was, last night, in the arms oS Clara Wroughton, who has not only more charms, but more love than halS her Sex put together.—She is a Venus: she is— I will explain mySelS—that you may be Sure I am in my Sober SenSes, tho’ I will allow that they have been lapped in Ely-Sium.
You, doubtleSs, remember that I told you how much tender impatience Clara discovered on the evening we parted. That impatience I determined to improve to my own advantage. Accord-ingly, I out-stayed my time, tho’ I can Scarcely deScribe what I Selt for above half an hour.
As Soon as I approached the garden door, I put my eye to the key-hole.—I

She was, as I defigned she should be, at the farther end of the walk when I put the key into the door.
Hearing me turn the key, stie redoubled her Speed, and by that time I had opened the door, absolutely flew into my
arms.
I had Scarce time to pay her for her haste by a profufion of kisses, ere she drew back, and, turning her blushing face afide. Said, in the most enchanting accents, “ Let me go. Sir Edward; I am half angry with you.”
For what, my life.?” Said I, devouring her pouting lips: “For staying So long? It was the fault of my watch,”

“ When you behave like my Clara,’*, replied I, gazing on her riling boSom, which Seemed to pant to meet mine, and to heave with an undissembled fear of having diSpleaSed me.

“You have only been too cool and coy,” anSwered I, Sullenly; letting her go a Second time.

I threw myfelf down by her in a moment, tore away the handkerchief which concealed her beauties, and pulled her Soft, weeping face to mine.
She made an effort to prevent my eager kisses, by dropping her head upon my bofom, but I Soon contrived to let her fink down gently on the graSs.—She was then too much in my power to make any great refistance: she still, however, strove to rife; crying, “Let me go; indeed, Stanly, I will not Suffer this”—tho’ I
plainly perceived, at the Same time, that her pashon for me was Sufficiently violent to make her efforts to apologize for her
yielding, and to Save her modesty ineffectual.

Words cannot deScribe her behaviour in a Situation which requires, even in the most rapturous moments, the greatest delicacy, I can only Say,, that she was So enchanting that she increaSed my love
Sor her, and doubled its ardor.
As Soon as she recovered from the delirium of joy into which she had been
hurried, tears rushed from her eyes
but they were not the tears of tendernefs, they were the tears of shame, Ibrrow, and refentment.
She looked as if she thought it her duty to aecufe me; but. she looked alSo loth to accufe me.
Just when she was going to reproach me, I stopped her with a Succession of fresh transports, stifled all her complaints, and fixed her more firmly mine than ever.—Her tendernefs increaSed every moment; but how I should have

out you.” Then shutting the door in a hurry, she prevented my reply.
I foon returned home, with my head and my heart full of my happinefs, and Sat down to communicate it to you.
And now, Beauford, you fee this is the only way to be taken with a woman. I am certain I have Secured to mySelf the entire possession of Clara’s heart and perfon, who has every requisite to intoxicate

T o
Sir EDWARD STANLY.
Have not been more shocked a great while than I was by the peruSal of your last letter.
You have adled, Stanly, with regard to Clara, a most unkind, cruel part.
Can
142 FEMALE FRAILTY.
Can a man who pretends to love a woman only to take advantage of her credulity, of the fincerity of her passion for him, be worthy of her tendernefs? Can Such a man talk, with any propriety, of delicacy? Of very little delicacy mull he be fenSible who can require Such proofs of a woman’s love. What mull the poor girl endure, when she comes to resteft upon your abufing her indulgence, and upon your drawing her in, by the most infamoussy artful behaviour, to gratify your inclination at the expence of her charadler and her peace ?
Indeed, Stanly, I feel for Mifs Wroughton. With thofe Sentiments, do you imagine that I shall ever bring my-Self to treat my dear, angelic Nancy in the Same barbarous manner ?—So far am I difpoSed to treat her in that manner, were she overwhelmed with her tender
Senfations,
/
FEMALE FRAILTY. 143
SenSations, and almost ready to grant me every favour which her beauty and my pashon might tempt me to Solicit, 1 would curb my paffion, whatever it cost me; my reSpedt should conquer my love enough to enable me to preServe my dear girl from falling a vidlim to her tender-neSs: a tendernefs which, indulged at a proper time, would make me the happiest of men: under the fandion of decency and virtue, how enchanting does it appear
Rested a little, Stanly, on the trea-fure which you have lost: your lofs is, indeed, irreparable: you ought, however, by a Speedy marriage, to make MiSs Wroughton all the amends in your power, for having Seduced her from the paths of virtue.—How unworthily, how unlike a man of honour have you aded! To Seduce a woman who had been virtu-
oussy

144 FEMALE FRAILTY.
oussy educated, and who, probably, would not have Swerved from the laudable principles instilled into her mind, if you had not baSely availed yourSelf of her fondneSs for you!—In how shameful a light do you appear in my eyes!—Since then the lovely Clara erred entirely on your account, will not her love, will not her gratitude plead in her behalf.? They Surely ought to plead strongly in her behalf.—Pity her—^pity her distressed Sami-ly :—confider that you are the Sole caufe of her distrefs and of theirs.^ and atone by a Speedy marriage—by the only way in your power—for the unmerited, and in-defenfible cruelty of your behaviour.— You would have married Clara if you could not have gained your point by dif-honourable proceedings; and have you not a thoufand times more reafon to marry her now, as she has undone herSelf
merely
FEMALE FRAILTY. 145
inerely to give you pleaSure ? Such a woman, So condeScending, has a fairer claim to our protedlion than any other: She has indeed an indiljputable right to it, by having purchaSed it with what is dearer to her than her life.
I have wrote to MiSs Garlics, not to
%
prevail on her, a Second time, to a(5l So indiscreetly as to quit her father’s houfe without his conSent; but only to assure her, that I will not alk her to accept of me till I am favoured with Mr. Garlies’s approbation: yet I have promiSed most Solemnly never to marry any other woman while she remains ssngle, and while there are the ssightest hopes of my ever being hers.
Follow my example, Stanly, if you have any virtue left, and make haste to make that woman happy, who has facri-ficed every thing to give you a felicity

T O
Lord BEAUFORD


O W inconsistently you talk, Harry? You must, certainly, be out of your SenSes, or you would never think of urging me to marry a woman whom I can have whenever I pleaSe,
without being obliged to a parfon for my
pleaSure.
FEMALE FRAILTY. 147
pleaSure. Had Clara been able to refist me, why, perhaps, merely on account of the oddity of the thing, I might have married her, as I fuppoSe I must have an heir to my estate—but I must be mad indeed to think of marrying her now. Why, she cannot exist without me—the
fond creature
a Single moment.
She
has more warmth in her expressions, more fire in her constitution than half the women in town. She is a most delicious girl, and loves me to distradtion; and yet I, adtually, believe, we shall quarrel.
We were on the brink of a falling out last night.
I met her, exadlly at the hour appointed at her own deSire; yet, becauSe I re-fufed to vifit at the houfe, she wanted to make a formal affair of it: and she is still in a stately way about it. I really won-

der women can be So unreasonable; but they have no consciences at all.
When she began to whimper, on my
t
only Saying that I thought we converSed more agreeably together without the interruption of a third perSon—I roSe up, and left her, again till she comes to herfelf.—This is the manner of behaving with the whole Sex at first; that is, with your women who have a charafler to keep, as they call it. Some, indeed, make a noife, I believe, in order to perfuade you that they have yielded, with the utmost re-ludlance, to give you a higher opinion of their modesty; others have a6lually pretended to be ashamed to look you in the face; and others, like Congreve’s Doris, absolutely deny any knowledge of you, tho* they flept, the night before,

by your fide. In short, there is no end to the fancies of women: they are the moSt capricious of beings: all of them but my Clara; my lovely Clara. She is not one of thofe whom 1 have been de-fcribing: She is above all diSguife; she freely owns her love, and dares as freely indulge her pashon to the highest pitch; yet with a delicacy which enhances the joy. I am half intoxicated with love and rapture.—I left her a little abruptly^ just to let her See I had no notion of being fooled, not even by the woman nearest my heart, but I shall fly to her again with more lively traniports: transports neither to be defined nor described.
As to you, my friend, who aSt upon So very different a plan, I wish you, heartily, fucceSs, as I do every man in

LETTER the Sixty-eighth. From the Same to the Same.
ELL! there is, certainly, very little stability in any thing in this world: Glara, the loveliest woman in it; Clara, whom I thought So fincerely. So permanently my own, has changed her mind all on a Sudden. In short, we have
had a violent quarrel:, Such a one that, I

Starting back from me, she cried, with looks at once expressive of Sorrow and regret, “ We meet no more, Stanly, but upon the terms you first propofed.”
“ What terms are thqSe, my angel,” anSwered I, endeavouring to catch her in my arms, and to kiSs her into a kinder humouf; not in the least imagining that, after what had palled between us, llie could think of my marrying her: but that was in the lady’s head; for she, in-

I, forcibly detaining her, while she was
turning to go towards the houfe. “ I love
you, at this moment, more passionately
than

than ever. Your beauty receives new lustre Srom thoSe little artifices to heigh-en my affedion, tho* it is Sufficiently ardent without them; and your wit grows more poignant by the variety which you throw into your conversation : it is that variety which makes you every hour a new obje<st, and a more adorable mistreSs.”
“ Hold, Sir,” cried she, pushing me back, while I strove to fix on her lips “ Hold, Sir; it is not as a mistreSs I defire to pleaSe: if I am not to be looked upon as your wife. Sir Edward, we break off all connexion, as I told you before.”

“ Infamous contradl! ” anSwered she, “ and you are still more infamous to offer it; to dare, indeed, to SuppoSe that it could be accepted—even listened to by me: but it is all my own fault: I, I only, am to blame.—^Deluded idiot, to ifancy that the dear deceitful man, whom I fondly loved, was more perfedt than the rest of his Sex, becauSe he was njore pleaSing; that his mind was as good as his perSon was attradling ; that his gra-' titude and his generofity would be equal to his tender vows, and Solemn protestations.—On your protestations, indeed,

Wild with impatience, I curled my-Self, and the whole world; and wished, a thoufand times, that I had perfisted in staying, in Spite of all she Said; but she was So provoking, that I did not know what I was about. If women knew what a confounded deal of mif-chief they do with their tongues, they would be more filent, perhaps, than they are. It is that curfed propenSity to tattling which ruins every thing.

Do not load me with reproaches, Sophy, I reproach my Self Sufficiently: my Self-reproaches are poignant beyond expression,

You and I, Sir George, look up*on things

Could Such a Sacrifice have been too nobly rewarded ? Certainly not. Stanly ought to have made her his immediately by the most Sacred ties; by marrying her he would not only have restored the tranquility of mind, and established her charafter, but have Secured her affedion, and fixed her gratefully to himfelf for ever.—Clara, Sir George, is by no means a looSegirl; she would not have yielded, I dare Say, on any account, to any other man than him to whom she had given her heart, than him^ from VoL.

Could you indeed, by any mode of perSuafion, prevail on Sir Edward, to make her Some atoneiuent for the injury he has done her, by marrying her himSelf, you would da a most laudable adlion: and every man of honour would •commend Sir Edward for Squaring his condiKst agreeably to your advice and intreaties.. But why should you think of sharing your title, and your fortune with Such a woman?

under the doniinion of a

strive to controul thoSe inclinations, which are likely to lead us into terrible indiscretions, what would become oS us ?' No woman would be Safe.—But I must stop here: It is painful to us to wound the bofoms of thofe to whom we are strongly attached by the ties of friendship.—^Yet what can I do for you, my* /
Clara? What can I fay that will administer the Slightest conSolation to you ? I
*
can only tell you that I think you have discovered uncommon nobleneSs of fenti-ment by rejedbing Lord Southern.—Forgive me, Clara, for adding, were you not a^luated by the remains of an affection which still disturbs your mind.?^ However, 1 will not do you So much wrong as to fuppofe it possible for you to think in the least favourably of that wretch who has destroyed your peace.
You must, certainly, abhor him; - and
you

you will, I hope, avoid him for the future as you would a contagious distemper. Many people, and many good people too, believe, that when a man consents to marry a woman, he makes her Sufficient amends for any injuries she may,
have received from him; yet I cannot be of that opinion.—The woman who has been deeply injured by her lover will, I think, shew a considerable want of delicacy, and no greatnefs of mind, if she accepts of him for her hushand—if she has indeed any connexions with him of any kind afterwards. He who can be bafe enough to furprife a woman whom he pretends to love honourably, into the
commission of a criminal. aXion, which must, inevitably, render her contemptible in her own eyes, and expofe her to his keenest reproaches (tho* he was the Sole cauSe of her distrefsful fituation) can

never be looked upon by her in the light in which she would wish to See a hushand.—Think no more, then, oS the unworthy Stanly, my dear Clara, but come down to me:^ new Scenes, and new objedSs may, in time, lessen your affliction, if not entirely remove it; they may, at least. Save you from delpair.—I am still willing to believe that, abandoned as Stanly is, he has not publickly boasted of your too great conSideratian for him; should he proclaim his infamous fuccefs, your appearance with your friends as ufual will invalidate every report injurious to your reputation.—Set out diredtly, therefore, and prevail on Mrs. Morden to accompany you.
My mother joins with me in this request; and Mr. Beverly has obligingly consented to stay a fortnight longer at my mother’s, that we may have the Satis-

fadlion of meeting. He only imagines
that Stanly and you have had a difference; but, at my request, he has promised not to mention him in your hearing. Come then, my dear, and receive all the conSolation you are capable pf tasting, from

This Clara is an abSoIute heroine:
a complete Lucretia. She not only peremptorily reSuSes to See me, but she will not receive a letter, not even a message Srom me: nor is it possible for me to get a fight of her any where. I have endeavoured to bribe her Servants, in order to flip into the houSe to her, but I cannot Succeed; and as to meeting-
^	O
her in any other place, I have not-the Smallest glimmering of a hope: becauSe she never goes out. Upon my Soul she
keeps
y •
\
FEMALE FRAILTY.
keeps it up glorioufiy; I really believe I shall marry her at last. Matrimony, I SuppoSe, is quite a Specific in caSes of this nature: and, poshbly, her behaviour is studied to oblige me to have recourSe to it. However, without a joke, a woman of exquifite Senfibility, who denies herSelf the transports ariSing from the Sight of the man she loves, after she has Surrendered to him at discretion, adts a very meritorious part.—She certainly loves me; and it was certainly her violent love for me—a passion not to be Subdued—^which threw her into my arms.—^It is a pretty clear caSe too, that a strong deSire to Secure me to herSelf, Supports her under her repeated refuSals. She
must, therefore, have feme virtue; that

is, she has a Sufficient quantity of it for a mistrefs, but not enough for a wife: for looSe as you think, me, Harry, I
shall

shall not endure the woman whom I keep only for my pleaSure—if she. is of a. dissolute turn.-
In CONTINUATION.
I-have just heard that Clara is extreme^, ly ill; her illneSs was to have been a great Secret; but as my fellows are perpetually upon the look-out, fome of
them have been informed that , she is very, much out. of order, y^et no phyfician, not even an apothecary has been Sent for.
I hope the dear creature is breeding, and then, if we are tacked together time enough to Save her credit, I shall have an heir without any farther trouble.-

Return my dear dear Sophy, my ever J. valuable Mrs. Beverly, a thouSand thanks Sor her most friendly letter, for her most kind invitation, above all; for who would have behaved in So generous a manner to a poor, undone creature ? I should, however, be a wretch indeed, quite lost to all SenSe of shame, to abufe Such uncommon friendship by accepting your offer. No, my Sophy—I will yet dare to call you mine—becaufe your friendship is greatly Superior to that uSu"

have not been, intentionally, criminal: an unlimited tenderneSs, a violent defire to shew the affedlion which I felt by every way in my power, led me, infen-Sibly, to lengths as little to be defended now, as they were then to be controuled. I had no deSign to commit either a crime or even a folly: I only meant to discover a fondneSs for the man whom I loved Sincerely; a fondneSs' which, I thought, I might at that time have indulged. . But what woman can prudently throw her-Self into her lover’s power.?—or rather,

into her own? Imagining too hastily, that the man who appeared to have truly repented of his former faults would not be guilty of the Same again, and thinking, at the Same time, that nothing could poshbly make me deviate from the line of hoirour, I was totally unguarded.

his approbation, she should have thought herSelf extremely happy; but as that could not be obtained, she was reSolved to shew her obedience, whatever it cost her; hoping that the conSciouSneSs of having done her duty, would reconcile her to any Situation.
Tears, it Seems, rolled down her-dear face, while she fat writing her letter. When she had finished it, she roSe to go down stairs. At that moment she beheld Mr. Garlics at the back of her chair.

all the conSolation which this fine young Sellow, madly in love, offers to her. I

the perSon she was to See, or she would not have been prevailed on to conSent to the interview.—The moment she entered the room in which I waited for her
(she was decoyed to a shop in the neighbourhood, a back-room in which I had Secured to mySelf, under the pretence of contributing to the relief of a family in distreSs) she started, and was going to hurry out of it ; but I caught her by her gown, enquired eagerly after Clara upon my knees (one must humble one’s

The word dead struck me to the foul: the idea of my Clara’s dying, almost deprived me of my fenSes : fancying, however, Sometimes, that this girl had, perhaps, represented her friend in a worle condition than she really was, merely to terrify me, I cried, “ Dying or living, I will fee her: I will make her mine in the most Solemn manner : therefore, my dear Mifs Melville,” continued I, Seizing her hand, and forcibly pressing it,

She struggled all the while to diSen-gage herfelf from me; but she was, I knew, pleaSed in her heart, notwithstanding her resistance. Did not Clara refist stoutly, and yet fall a viftim, at last, to my passion and to her own Women love to be forced to adt agreeably to their inclinations.
“ You will never be under any obligations to me^ Sir,” Said MiSs Melville, craning up her pretty white neck with a disdainful air; “ I, therefore, defire you to let me go. My poor, unhappy friend will Soon, as I have already told you, be out of the reach of any farther persecutions.’’

I acquainted yon, in my last, with my determination to fee Clara, if poS-

Sible. To facilitate the execution of
my defign, I told my faithful fellow.
that I would handfomely reward him.
if he could, by any means, bring about
an interview between us.
Yesterday he informed me, that, dun
ing thefe three or four hot days, MiSs
Wroughton had walked a little in the
garden, about eleven o’clock; but that
she had never stayed long in it, being
exceedingly weak and low. I found.
in short, that the dear creature had mif-
carried: I, therefore, began to brighten
up, thinking that I had not been guilty of
the miSchief I had apprehended; think-
ing too, that what I had done might be
repaired. I was only puzzled how to
get into the garden: for, tho’ I kept
the key, it was entirely uSeleSs; as a

However, I immediately removed that

obstrudtion, by procuring, with bribery, another key from the Smith who had made the new lock.—^With that key I hastened to the interested Spot on the wings of expedlation.—But how shall I deScribe the shock which I Sustained at the fight of the loveliest object I, once, ever beheld, reduced to the appearance of a Ikeleton!
She was Sitting in a green garden-chair ; her head rested upon her hand ; her face was as pale as ashes; her whole perSpii wais emaciated; and thofe arms, which were once So Soft, So plump. So finely fleshed, looked withered she trembled, and was Scarce able to lift up her head) which drooped like a blighted lily.
I stood, a moment, unperceived, as she was too much abforbed in thought to attend to me, or, indeed, to anything.

thing. I was altnost; petrified at the af-fedting Spedtacle beSore me, and lost all the powers of Speech and motion ; till she, turning her head, and feeing me, shrieked, and fell back without any appearance of life.
Refiedlion was then at an end : I flew to her, and caught her, fainting as she was, in my arms, raiSed her out of the chair, fat down in it mySelf, placed her on my knees, and laid her drooping head on my boSom.
It is imposhble for me to tell you, Beauford, what I felt at that instant My Soul was overwhelmed with tender-neSs, and grief. I strained her to my beating heart, and endeavoured to reanimate her languid frame by a million of impashoned kisses; and 1 Swear, sh-lemnly Swear, that I felt more tranl-
porting joy from the hopes of restoring
% ^
her
2o8 female frailty.
%
her to health and peace, than ever I experienced in my most rapturous moments with other women.
At length she opened her eyes, which leemed, at first, oppressed with a dying languor: but as Soon as her SenSes returned, she direded them to me with a horror which made me shudder; and cried, as loudly as her enSeebled voice would permit her — “ Good heaven! where am I!—Stanly, let me go, How dare you to offer to repeat the cruel injury you have done me ? Let me go”—(struggling.)
“ Do not struggle with me, my Clara,” replied I, riling, and stating her gently, tenderly in the chair. “ I do not mean to make any attempt at which you ought to be alarmed: my heart is but too SenSibly affeded with what I See you Suffer: I come not to renew my

offence; I come to expiate it in the most honourable manner: I come to implore your forgiveneSs, to Sue for your dear hand, that I may make you mine by the most Sacred ties : and I Solemnly Swear, that I will Ipend my future life in giving you every proof of my tendernefs and esteem in my power.”
I knelt at her feet while I Spoke thefe words, and my hands Softly detained hers : the moment I paufed, she forcibly pulled them away, lifted them, with her still lovely eyes, still lovely in Ipite of the dying languor in them, and Said, Oh my God ! this, this is too much ■Teach me, merciful heaven, to Support this Severe trial.”-—Then, laying her hands on the arms of the chair, to assist her riSing, she added, “ Let me paSs, Sir Edward; every thing is at an end between us; I have been a weak,

210 FEMALE FRAILTY.

“ You shall not live with dishonour, my dearest Clara,” cried I, eagerly^ pierced to the foul by the nobleneSs and

purity of her Sentiments, “ you shall be, immediately, my wife: the dear, adored mistreSs of my fortune, as you

will then Spend every hour of my life in studying to repair the miSchiefs I have occafioned.
“ No, Sir,” Said she, laying her icy hand; upon mine; “ no-r-it is all: over with me: I shall Soon be no longer Sensible of pleaSure or pain in this world. May all-gracious God accept of my Sincere penitence, and not think me undeserving of his mercy in the world to come.—I have nothing more to defire, but your immediate abSence.

ing her that her condudt, her Sentiments had made a total change in mine*, that her affedling condition had excited my tenderest compassion, had increaSed my love and esteem, the warmest love and the fmcerest esteem; that my heart was unalterably hers, and that I could never think oS having a connedlion with any other woman.—In short, I talked my-felS quite out of breath, but all to ho purpoSe; she more than once, however, turned away her head, and wiped away her falling tears.
The noble firmneSs which she discovered, tho’ mingled with a tendernels almost too great to be Suppressed, in-creafed my love to a violent degree, and I could not bear the thoughts of giving her up for ever. I threw myfelf at her feet a Second time, encircled her with my arms as she stood tottermg, and con^-

r
See me.
The latter part of that Speech touched her: she fetched a deep Sigh: her boSom heaved, and a shower of tears streamed from her eyes.—I entertained new hopes. I role, and folding her in my arms, called her my life, my foul, my angel, and assured her that I should ever doat upon her for condescending to pardon me, and to receive me again into her favour.
Pushing me from her, with a strength which I little expeded, she cried, “ No,

Grown absolutely furious by her repeated refuSals, and finding mySelf utterly unable to prevail on her, with all the tender rhetoric to which I had recourSe, I Seized her in my arms, and vowed never to let go my hold till she conSented to be my wife.
She, at first, calmly deSired me to leave her, and strove to repel me by a coolnefs which was, I plainly Saw, af-fefted; but finding that nothing would do, she Screamed.
I was very Soon Surrounded by domestics of every kind, headed by Mrs. Morden, and MiSs Melville, who ordered them to refcue Clara, and to turn mt out of the garden.
I bade the rafcals stand off, and not presume to touch either me or my dearest wife,

Sir Edward,” continued she, with a look inexpressibly moving; “ let me intreat you to leave me, it is my final request.—-I have not a great while to live, let me have no reaSon to complain of you in my last moments.”

A heavy Sigh followed thefe words caufed by a difficulty of breathing.
Mrs. Morden, and Emma, both ex-claimed, “ Oh! God! she is dying.”
I still Supported her, tho’ the Servants crowded round us to take her from me.

Again turning to me, she Said, in faultering accents—“ For the love of heaven leave me, Stanly.”—She then,

Mrs. Morden was, by this time, clinging to her, and preffing her to let them carry her in.
“ It is no matter,” anfwered she, “ fince it happens So, let him See me die: it may

have a good effeft:—pray God it may;
(lifting up her poor emaciated hands.) Then, failing on Mrs. Morden’s neck, she cried, “ Forgive me my dear, much loved aunt, for all my past errors; you have been the tenderest of friends to me; forgive me.—-Pray to all-merciful God to forgive me.—Forget me, if possible.
Mrs. Morden could only reply with her fobs, and her tears.
“ Now lay me on the ground,” Said the dying angel; “ stwas here. I fell from virtue; here I am punished for my pre-Sumptiom—-Do you, my dear Emma

While she was Speaking thoSe words, Mrs. Morden and Emma, in the midst of their lamentings, intreated her earnestly not to talk: intreated her to endeavour to compoSe herfelf; elpecially the former, who Sat down on the graSs by her.—On Mrs. Morden’s boSom, she, in a few moments, without a groan, expired.

With my hands claSped, with my heart agonized, I stood gazing on the poor departed objedl of my fondest love—I would have approached, and knelt before her, but Mrs. Morden cried, O let not that wretch come near my dear child, whom he has killed: take him away; he is the cruellest of murderers.” I felt mySelf, indeed, a barbarous aS-Sashn, and Suffered the fellows, who advanced at the command of their mistreSs, to conduct me to the fatal door which I had entered for the destruftion of innocence; yet I still lingered for another last look.
