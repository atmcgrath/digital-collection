You are already acquainted that my leaving School was in conSequence of my uncle, Henry WilSon’s quitting England in the Ipring of 1774, without any previous notice to my father,
or any other relative; as Soon as it was known on the Royal Exchange, a very intimate and kind friend Sent an ex-preSs to my father, at his Seat in Lincolnshire, to which he had retired upon his quitting buSineSs, Some fourteen or fiSteen years before, the news So dreadful and So unexpe<5ted, would have gained no credit had it been received from a leSs relpedtable authority.
His immediate preSence in town was absolutely necessary, therefore exerting himSelf to Sooth and calm the mind of my ever honored mother, be prepared for his journey the follow-

father, and was left in the possession of about forty thouSand pounds, and Some of the first connexions in the commercial world, but the unhappy

rage for Speculations in the funds, which ruined So many merchants in the year 1772, and will never Sail to ruin the wealthiest, when too deeply entered into, destroyed his, still then, flattering proSpeds: Unable to Support his own feelings, but most the meeting with a brother his condud had fatally ruined and who from the time of my grandfather’s death had united the parent with the brother, induced him to quit the kingdom, after my father had taken one day’s refpite from his perturbation of mind and fatigue, he advertiSed a meeting of my uncle’s creditors.
In order to learn the particular state of his brother’s affairs, and at the Same time to take the fenSe of the company reljpeding his own relponSibility, he having, to uSe his very emphatical ex-

After taking a very affectionate leave of his city friend, he returned into the country, first to Sooth my dear mother’s mind, which you^ will naturally Suppole was in a state of the greatest agitation j to be stript in a moment of every plea-furable enjoyment and comfort, of all the elegancies of life, was a trial which

tenants j this painful but necessary measure was immediately executed, allowing every fervant fix months wages in advance, as a ffnall confideration for their Sudden difinission.
To paSs over this affefling Scene, which took place about four days after my return from School, would be injuring the cauSe of virtue : Most of the Servants had lived with my parents many years.

While this was passing in the great dining parlour, James was not giving that attention to the duties of his station he uSually did; on inquiring where he was, or what had occaSioned his abSence, the groom Said, about two hours before he had deSired him to Saddle the horSe he uSually rode when attending his master on his morning ride, and begged him, should he be wanted, to give his duty to his master and lady, and Say he should return in leSs than three hours; while they were expressing their Surprise at his abfence without leave, a liberty before he never preSumed to take, he was obServed crossing from

emotion and more alertneSs than at his

my parents had just retired, and put-ing down a little tin box, which he carried under his arm, he dropt instantly down on his knees, then catching hold of my father by the Skirts of his coat and looking tenderly up, entreated his pardon for his abSence, faying, when he went out in the morning he had not power to aSk his honor’s leave, and that if he could have done So, he well knew his defign being known he should have been commanded to stay at home, that what he had been doing, and was then going to Solicit, though he knew it was great presumption, he had, notwithstanding.

my mother at first Suggested, breaking a Seal that Sastened together the two ends of a piece oS red tape, he raiSed up the cover, and taking out the contents one by one, placed them by his fide with a grace Seldom Sound in his humble walk in life, then looking tenderly in his master’s face, Sor he had for Some minutes before relpedtfully withdrawn his eyes, and fixed them on the box ; ‘Ht is now, pleafe your honor,” fays he, wiping from, his 'cheek.

The Surprise that took poffession of my

And though few men in the kingdom better knew how to blend affability with that dignity his former Situation and fortune required, he lost all attention to forms, for Seizing James in his arms he raiSed him from his humble posture, with an east to himSeif the more extraordinary, as he was at that time much dejetsted and weak, and leading him by the stand, made stim let down on tste Sofa by stis fide,, and after a deep figli, ste faid, “ Your unparalleled attacstment to tste fortunes of an unhappy master require that I make a fuitable return; I have always looked upon distinflions, the const-quence of fortune merely, as below the attention of a cultivated feeling mind,

This had like to have occafioned a Severe struggle on the part of James, but my father declaring he did not at

And nov/, for the first time, my mo-ther broke Silence:	You must per-

After a passage no ways tedious
or unpleaSant, Save in the idea of parting Srom, and leaving for a time an affeDionate and much honored parent, I arrived Safe in the Downs, and by the first boat that left the ship I diS-patched the letter you honored me with, to your old and intimate friend, Mr. Manley; on the third day I was fevored with a line from that gentle-

man, intimating his intention oS being at the King’s-Arms the Sollowing day in the evening, to which place he entreated I would forward Such things from the ship, as I should have occa-fion for, before the remainder could be prepared to be fent to town: His obliging instriKstions I immediately requested might be performed, and leaving proper orders for the conveying what yet remained on board, proceeded in the ship’s boat to the shore, that I might on no account Suffer that gentleman’s politeneSs to outstep the re-Ipedt due to the attention paid to me; nor lest due to the fHend So much re-Ipedted and valued by my father.
I had just ordered the waite r to bring a bottle of Madeira wine, with a decanter of water, and a large tumbler, when I observed a carriage with four

forty-two or three: Aster fome little time Spent in learning from my host whether a gentleman of my name and description had arrived there, which being anSwered in the affirmative, (for 1 had previoufiy given the landlord my addreSs) they were shewn up stairs i there was no need for me to put to Mr. Manley the necessary questions; you had, my dear Sir, So often related to me, from my early youth. So many
traits of his charaDer, and the impref-Sion of your narration had So forcibly depi(5ted that gentleman upon my mind,
that I dropt instantly upon one knee,

and Seizing his haiid between mine,
pressed it instantaneoussy to my lips:
He

THE ENGLISH MERCHANT. 6j
He immediately raiSed me Srom this posture, and calling me his beloved ward, his dear Van Heimont, pressed me to his boSom: Vv^hile- this was passing, the young gentleman who accompanied him made an effort to diS-perSe a rear that hung quivering at the corner of his leSt eye, but obServing I had noticed his emotion, he raiSed the back of his hand up to his cheek, walked ssowly to the window, and im mediately opened it: Mr. Manley gained the Soonest the command of his feelings; after pressing me a Second time to his boSonn he addressed him-Self to his friend, who was immoveably fixed at the window.
My dear Harry, you must pardon my Seeming inattention to the established rules of policeneSs, there is Something in the vrorkings of nature Superior to all rules; but Such as riSe

out oS the Subject, they must plead my excuSe; and now. Sir, give me leave te introduce to you Mr. Henry Van Helmont, the Son of my old and much relpe(5led friend, Peter Van Helmont.,
Then turning to me, he Said, Mr. Van Helmont knew my very amiable Sriend, Mr. Sommerville; you will, I am perSuaded, in time improve the re-fpeest you may at this moment entertain each Sor the other, into a warm and lasting Sriendship : That you may, will afford me great pleaSure. I know Mr. Sommerville to poffels an excellent head, with a better heart; better, Sor however excellent the former may deviSe, stis the latter that stamps the impreshve value on the adtion; nor lest am I perSuaded that my young Sriends amply correipond with every good and amiable quality. We roSe

together and embraced each other, and

That gentleman now rang the bell, ordered the waiter to place the wine, water, and tumblers, he had before put on the Sideboard, upon the table, and to prepare Supper ready by nine o’clock, poured out a glaSs oS Madeira, and taking me affe(5lionately by the hand, welcomed me to England.
Mr. Sommerville followed immediately the example Mr. Manley had Set him, and Spoke now Sor the first
time, “ The many favors Mr. Manley is constantly in the habit oS confering on thoSe he honors with his acquaintance, are the general topics of his nu merous friends; but the distinguished honor he has this day conferred upon me, will leave a lasting impression upon my mind, that time and distance never

DEAR SIR,
T is now little better than three weeks fince I had the pleaSure to addreSs mySelf to you, acquainting you with my SaSe arrival, how I was Situated, and my intended plan oS Seledling from the giddy and gay, a lovely female, who with all the vivacity naturally attendant upon youth, should yet be mistreSs of So much good fenSe, as to render it pleaSing, not diSgusting,

which is too bSten the caSe, with thoSe young ladies who are deemed by the men girls of Spirit.—I have Srequented the rooms every public night, the library, the uSual shops for raffling, the morning lounge, as well as all the various rides, in the neighbourhood; and while I cannot but acknowledge in juS-tice to the ladies, wsho honor this place with their preSence, that there are many lovely and even highly accomplished women, yet my heart has remained perSedlly in the Same eaSy state as beSore my arrival; indeed I Srequently cannot help thinking, whether justly So or not I leave to your better SenSe to determine) that theSe very public Scenes are leSs calculated to inSpire love than my fair country-women are well aware of) that paffion likes retirement, and sties from the buSy haunts of men.” The variety of objeds that strike the mind disturb the impression, they otherwise

could not Sail to make, aand leave the passions unfixed, unSettled, having much to admire, but equally unable to re-Solve and determine.
I was in this humour oS reaSoning, when, having taken my tea, and putting a volume oS Sterne’s Shandy iff my pocket, I Sallied forth, intending to vary my uSual walk; therefore leaving this old Sea-girt town a little on my right hand, I continued to Saunter without the least knowledge of the road or where the path led to j by this time I bad exceeded three miles when observing a beautiful clump of cheSnut trees, shading the Summit of a gradual rile, no great distance from me, I determined to gain the top, not only to enjoy the air more freely, but to increaSe the beauties of The Scene by a view of the Sea; this was no Sooner reSolved than accomplished.
While
THE ENGLISH MERCHANT. 83
While I stood admiring Sol’s bright beams, then Sast declining, playing on the glassy boSom of old Ocean, my eyes were Suddenly struck with the ravishing Sound oS mufic; SurpriSed to find any melody. Save what the nightingale afforded, who had just bcSore been finging his evening hymn to the ineffable Sather of nature, it engaged ail my attention to diScover from whence the found came; when bein» convinced
it must come, as the wind then fat,

from th0 valley that lay on my left at the foot of the little hill I had just before afcended, I immediately determined to explore my way to the glade below j the nearer I arrived at the baSe of the hill, the more perfedlly the Sounds met my ear.

shaded my view, I obServed at the foot, and within two hundred yards of the place I then stood upon, three most lovely females, one playing with great taste on the guitar, while another accompanied with her ^voice, tranScend-ently melodious and ravishing; I could hardly believe but I trod on fairy ground; while a third beautiful female was between the Songs, for I heard more than one, complimenting, at least from at her attitude I So conceived she did her amiable friends upon their execu-
r*
tion and taste : I made my approach Sufficiently near to enjoy both the mu-fic and the words; having no wish on

any account to learn the least Secret of their hearts; yet I could not forego the pleaSure I then enjoyed, though I should delpiSe myfelf were I capable of meanly listening to their conversation.

In
THE ENGLISH MERCHANT. 8^
In this fitiiation I had for Some time remained, When, upon the finishing
poor Goldsmith’s air in his Vicar of
/
Wakefield, the lady who had ’till then been paffive, by a Sudden and quick turn of her hea,d discovered me; which she no Sooner did, than Setting up a violent Scream, she fainted upon the boSom of her friend; my alarm and ap-prehenfion was little leSs than theirs; I felt I was observed, and Scarce knew whether I had better fly to their assistance or retreat; the latter idea was re-pugnant to my feelings, though I must own I was utterly unable to advance a Single step.
I waited Some moments ’till I found the lovely girl, by the help of a Smelling bottle, and the Iprinkling of a few drops of water, which happily enough flowed murmuring by, only a few paces from where they were leated, began
to

to recover; observing the ladies, her
her to riSe, I
assisting
Gompanions, thought I might venture to approach and apologize for the interruption’ and distreSs I had occasioned. This I did in the best manner I could, but awkwardly enough I dare Say; Sor never in the courSe of my liSe had I leSs command of mySelf; indeed three Such lovely women I never before at any time Saw; and though I was conScious I was wounded beyond expression, they were all Such elegant and beautiful girls that I could not instantly discover which had robbed me of my heart: They received my apology with that dignity, eafe, and grace, that shewed they were no strangers (however affedted by my intruSion) to the first and politest circles in the kingdom; indeed, my dear Sir, had Paris been once more possession of the apple, it
would have been difficult to Say to which
of
THE ENGLISH MERCHANT. 87
of thefe lovely girls he should give it with justice: All my entreaties to attend them home was ineffedtual, they inSisted upon my permiting them to retire by themlelves; awed by the dignity oS their manner, and conScious I had (though undefignedly) occaSioned their distreSs, I acquieSced, and making each a relpedtSul bow, remained mo-tionleSs, where I stood, still my strained eyes could perceive them no longer. I now explored’my way back in the best manner I could;
Though I did not reach the town still Some time aSter dush, I was not then the least dilpoSed to dreSs Sor the rooms; indeed the perturbation oS mind I laboured under required retirement ; I would have given halSmy fortune to have known where to find theSe lovely incognita’s, for I am confident they do not frequent the rooms, if in deed

deed they ever enter them; still I shall learn what Seven dread to know, their name, family, and whether what affedts me infinitely more, the lovely Lucy, (for by that name her young companions called my charmer) is or is not engaged, I can never be happy.
There does not appear, from the tranfient view I was able to make, any material difference in their ages; the angelic Lucy I take to be in her nineteenth or twentieth year; the tender and expressive concern her lovely countenance difplayed when she flew to the brook, fixed an impression on my foul that no ,time or distance will remove; I must exert all my addreSs on this oc-caSion, for I have perfiiaded mySelf thefe ladies, however recluSe they may live, are not more fiiperior in perSonal attraddons than in their mental acquire-

I had Some thoughts this morning of returning to town early in the enSu-ing week, but that I feel is as utterly out of my power as it is now distant from my wish; I have ordered a boiled chicken for my Supper, but whether I shall even taste it is more than I can at this moment determine; be that as it may, I shall at least take off a bumper (no uSual custom with me) to the health of my Sweet incognita, and her lovely friends: How placid and Serene was my mind at noon, but what a change has one short hour made in my peace! Should I fail to diScover their retreat, and I have not the least line of direction, I shall be miserable in the extreme; but indeed I cannot bring mySelf to think three Such lovely women can be iequestered. So as to evade the starch of a lover impelled by that buSy passion imSucceSsful j every difficulty disappears, there is not any thing we willingly

MY DEAR EMILY,
HAVE retired to my room to an-Swer my lively Sriend’s letter, and do you Sincerely think while we insisted on the agreeable stranger’s per-miting us to return alone, that a dif-Serent Sentiment prevailed at the time in our boshms or is my Emily thrown a little Srom her guard, has she been describing what, to be Sure, is not oS the stretch ofprobability; or is it only
a

a tender trait of what, on a fimilar oc-cafion, has passed in her own mind ?
Come, you stand arranged, confels the truth, and throw yourlelf on the mercy of the court; the lovely listers have read the passage, and b*Lit one opinion prevailed, that while you was kindly Solicitous for the happinefs and future peace of your friends, you was tacitly impeaching a certain lady of your acquaintance, for an instance of cruelty to her lover, at the expence of her own quiet; and fo you are determined to dilpofe of the stranger’s heart to one of us, at least ? indeed I have, (to own the truth) often heard of love at first Sight, and I must acknowledge my lovely friends appeared to every advantage that mufic and melody could produce; though abstradted from thefe elegant accomplishments, their personal charms alone were Sufficient to

fix the attachment oSthe most changeable oS the Sex.
We have never fince that evening revifited the Ipot; once the Srequent Seat of our amuSements, not that we conceive should chance or deSisin throw the stranger in our way, that we have any thing to apprehend on the Score of behaviour, his manners were much too
graceful
to

DEAR SIR
EMBRACE the first opportunity I have to anSwer the letter you favoured me with, by which I find it is likely your stay in the neighbourhood where you now are, will probably be much longer than you at first intended; I have not the least doubt that the ladies you So unexpectedly SurpriSed are lovely elegant women, and the circumstance of their not appearing at the
F 2
rooms
lOO THE ENGLISH MERCHANT.
rooms (for I cannot believe from their
knowledge
of the retreat, they are strangers to thole parts) dilpofes me to think they have been brought up with more than ufual care and attention, for though I have not the least objedlion to young ladies appearing occaSionly at places of public refort, yet I must declare I think that female exceedingly to be blamed, wdio constantly is met there, it makes their perfons too cheap, and they acquire infenSibly a boldnefs, or more properly fpeaking, a lefs reserve, than is confistent with the delicacy of the female character.
Senfible as I am that my dear Henry is incapable of making an imprudent choice, yet I do at all times give him my Sentiments without reServe upon the Subject, and I am convinced the motive that induces me So to do, will plead ray excuSe for the liberty; to
fay
THE ENGLISH MERCHANT. lOI
fay nothing of the interest I have in whatever relates to his happineSs, it will afford me infinite pleaSure to See my deServing friend united to the most amiable of her Sex, that many years will not paSs away before that happy event shall take place is my Sincere wish, and that whenever it shall be your good fortune to be So united, I hope it will be productive for many,, many years of great felicity and comfort to yourfelf and your fair partner : Indeed I think it incumbent on every man turned of twenty-five, more elpecially all who, like yourfelf, have an ample and independent fortune, to turn their thoughts to matrimony; stis a debt they owe to their country, and an injunction laid upon them by the great
Author of Nature; therefore you may, Sommerviile, reafonably conclude, as you are drawing near to that age, it is but just you shou'd endeavour to fix

your
102 THE ENGLISH MERCHANT.
your affe<5l;ions, that you may become a more reSpedtable member of the community: 1 hope you will shcceed in your endeavours to find your incognita, and that the lovely maid may not only be diSengaged, but anSwer in all reSpedts that charadter I should be happy to compliment as the wife of my friend.
I shall be glad to learn your SucceSs should So much good fortune attend you} or, on the contrary, to confole you under any disappointment you may experience.
My young friend Van Helmont is much improved both in his health and Spirits; indeed, I believe the amiable young man has Suffered no little from leaving the fostering arms of a ten-der father, it gives me great pleafure
to
THE ENGLISH MERCHANT. IO3
to think him more reconciled than at firstj, and indeed than he appeared to be Sor Some time aSter his arrival, I flatter mySelS the air where he now is, Superadded to the exerciSe and amuSe-ments, he may partake of, will in a fliort time restore him to perfedl health: We riSe by fix o’clock in the morning, mount our horSes, and either ride round the park, which is Spacious, or to the hamlet in the neighbourhood, return about eight, breakSast almost immediately, after that retire to the library, or our own Setting rooms, there two or three hours paSs away in a manner both entertaining and instructive ; we then (Sor I generally accompany him) walk ’till stis time to return home to

Tired at the SruitleSs purSuit I had made, I left the place I stood on, which was nearly as I can gueSs, the very Spot where theSe lovely girls were Seated, and amuSed, when I So fortunately interrupted them fitting down by the brook in order to take my little repast, the Spring being immediately at my fide and within my reach, could I for a moment have forgot' what carried me there, I Snould have preferred it

At this instant of time the hushand returned, and was, as you may naturally shppoSe, greatly furprifed to find a stranger in his houle : I acquainted him with the reashn that had induced me to take the liberty, that I found
mySeif much better, and should be able

found my- way to his cot, as it stood iiT. a manner hid Srom the passenger; !• agreed with him that his dwelling was-
O	O
certainly very retired, and that my ob-fcrving it was merely- accidental.
I then begged to be inSormed'whe-ther there were any gentlemen’s Seate near his cottage, and wshether they resided on them. ASter paufing as if to conSider iShe should reSolve me or not, and looking attentively but reSpeClSully at me, replied, he could not but own there were Some fev/ rdpedtable Sami-lies in the vicinity of his cot; who re -Sided there the year round, but that the principal families went ufually to London in the winter; that one family in particular lived very much retired, for though they had refided in the neighbourhood Several years, he never re-eoliedted to hear they ever had viSited any other-family than the worthy Doc--
tor’s
THE ENGLISH MERCHANT. I37
' tor’s, who had the living, that his cottage belonged to one Mr. Hartley, which was the gen deman’s name he had be Sore mentioned, that he had only one daughter, a most amiable young lady, who was particularly intimate at the ParSonage-HouSe, adding.
that the DoDor’s daughters and MiSs Hartley were inseparable companions, and' Srequently in their walks called at his cot, and generally brought Some little thing or other Sor the children.
While this diScourSe passed we had walked inSenSibly into his little orchard, at the back oS the cottage, when casting my eye over the hedge I obServed a lady passing along, and prelently Saw two more at the short diStance of a

Small field; mentioning to him what I Saw, he looked for a moment at the Ipot, and exclaimed, they are the very
ladies that I was deScribing to you;
they
IjS THE ENGLISH MERCHANT.
they are the lovely MiSs Smiths and MiSs Hartley.
Before I could well recover from my wonder, the lovely girls entered the houfcj judge whafwasmyjoy when
\
they approached,.to find they were the
Same lovely girls that had given me So much pkaSure, and occafioned me So much anxiety todiScovcr.
They were Scarcely Seated when my friendly host, defirous of paying- his re:^eds to them, proceeded to the
houSe, and turning to me Said, “ I Scarce
know how to a(5l: upon this occaSion, but as you appear So much the gentleman, I will venture to take you with
me.

We entered together, ^'Ladies,’* Said the cottager, “ pardon me for introducing this stranger, the gentleman

w^as taken Suddenly ill and called at my cot, just before you came.”
The astonishment they shewed is better conceived than exprest; their colour came and went, they looked at each other, and then at the cottager, to dilcover, if possible, by what means I could possibly have found his retreat:
and

ing it incumbent on me to di every trait of SuSpicion that might fall on,the eh^radler of this honest man, I proceeded- to state, that in my morning ride finding myfelf Seized with a pain in my fide, and discovering this habitation, I gave my horSe to my Servant, and ventured to approach it, that what I had then done having been the means of introducing me to the most lovely of rheir Sex, I should ever confide r as the most fortunate circum-stance of my life that as the intruuon

what I fince had Suffered, wdiat now X felt.
The young lady I took for Mifs Hartley being lefs embarrassed than her fair friends, taking the lead, replied, that the interruption to their
amuSement that evening was no farther
o
of confeqiience than the alarm it had occasioned, which was tranSitory~that our unexpedfced meeting this morning
had ce#ainly been matter of great Sur-

Sometimes occasionally called upon in

their walks—that as they had not the honor oS being known to me, and should be expedted home, they must retire.
They all immediately roSe, and washing Mr. and Mrs. Harris a good morning, (for by this name they called them) moved towards the door; conscious if I lost this opportunity I should not eaSily find another, I begged to accompany them a little on their way; they heSitated as if unprepared to reply. Taking advantage of this Snort pauSe I proceeded.
tranger that I amj ladies, I Scarce know how to preSs, what to Sorego would render me wretched in the extreme ; I would not for any confider-ation under heaven, wound the delicacy of your feelings, but how can I refolve to quit the lovely young lady I have

“To doubt,” replied MiSsHartley, “ however accidental our meeting this day, that you anxioufiy deSired it,
would be, perhaps, an injury to your

He was always exceedingly fond oS my mother; I am, by the Samily, thought extremely like her, on which account I have, Srom a child, been no Smajl favorite with my Lord; this circumstance, Superadded to the proS-pedt there was of my Succeeding to his title and estates, has indeed made him look upon me more as his Son than his nephew; to do but common juf-tice to his affedlion for me, I must declare he has been Sufped;ed (for his lady died when he was in the prime
of life) to have remained Single purely
\
on that account; however that may be,

jto do justice to the affedlion and ten-derneSs of my uncle.
He is, as may be naturally expe<5ted, very anxious to have me marry; on this point I am ready to meet his wish, provided he will patiendy wait ’till I shall find the lovely charmer whoSe chains the fickle god shall decree me to wear; all my feards, he has previ-oussy engaged his own feelings, without once thinking of mine; a failing, my dear Harry, that our Superiors frequently run into, (with the best of in-tentions I grant them) but generally with the worst confequences to their

Having recovered from the furpriSc this strange circumstance had occasioned, I took the lead of the lovely Lucy, who I perceived had not entirely conquered her amazement at what she Saw, perhaps it might be from what she felt, by declaring, that what passed that evening was of the leSs moment, as I felt no ill effedts or conSequences from it, that their meeting where they then w'as had greatly astonished them all; there could be no doubt, that not having the honor to know the gentleman I had addressed, and perSuaded we should be shortly expeDed to return, my lovely friends rifing at the Same instant, we prepared to move; when the stranger, perceiving our intention, determined to avail himSelf of

and concluded by Saying, his fortune was ample, and independent, and that he would leave his charafter to his

DEAR BINGLEY,
HAD the pleaSure to receive the letter you did me the Savor to ad-drels to me, by yesterday’s post, and embrace this early opportunity to make my acknowledgments for it; I think you have an excellent uncle in his Lord-ship, and that, with all his particulari-‘ ties, he is intitled to every attention you can pay to him: That he Should feel an interest, and deSire to See you

happily
174 the ENGLISH MERCHANT.
happily married, is natural, ’ds the con-fequence of his regard and affection, and however you may feel yourfelf indifferent with rtSpect to a peerage, I am convinced it would not fail to have great influence with the greater part of our young men of fafliion; it does by no means follow becauSe he is defirous to See you Settled, that he has any intention to lay the least restraint upon your affections; ssiould he do that,, I fiiould think you justified to withstand the tyranny, for what leSs can it be called, when thofe who we might rea-fonably expect to pay the greatest regard to our happineSs, blinded by views of ambition and grandeur, are the •means of destroying it for ever.
I agree with you, my dear Bingley, that it is matter of much SurpriSe and wonder what paffion can possibly influence our experienced and dearest relatives
THE ENGLISH MERCHANT. I75
fives, in the constraint they unSeelingly (Sor So it appears to me) lay upon our attachments; they can have nothing ultimately in view leSs than the conservation oS our happineSs, though it appears to our warm and empassioned ideas utterly repugnant to the acquirement of it; I am Sometimes more than
I
halSinclined to think, we oug^ht indef-Serence to their affeftion and experience, to pay a little ^more regard to their opinions, than is uSual Sor youth and inexperience to allow; and yet, to refign for ever the lovely woman, whoSc perSonal charms and mental accomplishments have gained a Sull aScendancy over our afiedtions, is a Sacrifice i own my Self utterly unable to make ; if happineSs is attainable on Such terms only, I am certain I shall riSque the being miserable for life.

How far your Savorite author’s opi” nion refpeding the admission oS evil in a general lenSe, may apply to this particular caSe, I am unprepared to determine ; I entertain the highest relpedt for his clear and concluSive manner of reasoning, and am inclined to think with you, that there is a certain mixture of alloy, or evil, in the happiest connexions that v/iSdom itfelf could form, but then, as he very justly remarks, if the good refulting upon the whole exceeds the little difficulties and evils attendant on it; it is, neverthelels, a consummation devoutly to be wished,” and can only be Supported with becoming temper and philoSophy when the objedl is Seledled by our own unbiassed Sentiments of regard and affec-tion; let age be content to direct our paffions, without attempting to fix in
an arbitrary manner our affections, the
heart
THE ENGLISH MERCHANT. I77
heart and Sentiment alone can fix, that feels its own best interest, and prudently directed, can Seldom fail to accomplish it.
That affluence, my dear Sir George, influences too generally the mean and the bafe, cannot be denied; nor is it strange it should do So : How can we reasonably expect a nobleneSs of Ipirit and Sentiment from thofe little minds, v/ho, fixing all happineSs in their eventual sticceSs in life, are incapable of feeling a pleaSure abstracted from that purSuit?
Depend upon it, should their endeavours be crowned with luccels, the Same mean principle that induced their Servility, will not fail as arrogantly to assume an equal share of conSequence; ’tis a part of their very nature; for none but the in-,ward!y proud can Submit to be Sordidly mean; fortune is their deSideratum, the want of it constitutes every miSery;

the man who meanly centers all happi-neSs in his perSonal aggrandizement, must be a character contemptible beyond comparison, he must stave lost every Social Seeling, in the narrowneSs of his opinions in his little SelS: How unlike is Such a character to our common friend, Mr. Manley! whoSe principle pleaSure Springs from diffuSing happinels to all around him, and, I am Sully perSuaded, iS instead oS ten thousand per annum, his whole estate produced but one Solitary hundred, like the man oS RoSs, he would divide that little with the worthy in distreSs; stis Srom Such acts our greatest pleashre ariSes, ’tis through them we anticipate that happineSs the Sather oS mercies has treaSured up Sor the just and benevolent, who infinitely Superior to the narrow view that instuences the bulk oS mankind, are constantly

endeavouring like good and SaithSul stewards, to alleviate the distreSs oStheir Sellow creatures, by distributing to their wants and necessities a part and portion of their abundance.
The man who acts on principles like thele acquires more greatnels in one day, than kings or kingdoms can boast in ages; he wants no elegant mauSc-leum to point out where his remains were depoSited; he cannot die while one kindred Spirit exists; he enjoys while living, the happineSs his good-neSs had diffuSed, and the tears oSthousands Sail lamenting over his bier.

Did the Same benevolent Spirit happily pervade the breasts oS the noble and the rich, what miSery would in con-Sequence be diSpelled ? Did they Sor a moment reflect that what Serves to Sur-nish out a Single banquet, would give

DEAR SIR,
N my Sormcr letter I acquainted you with my having unexpectedly discovered my lovely incognita, and oSevery thing that had occurred before, or past tliat morning, at the cottage; I returned to my apartments infinitely happier than I had ever been Since the evening we first met at the brook, in order to allow
my amiable Lucy a proper and de-

as well as to afford a like relieSto my perturbated Spirits; I took three or four days to concert my Suture plan, and to learn as many particulars oSMr. Smith’s Samily as were necessary Sor me to know; I took all possible care So to make my inquiries as to evade all Suspicion oS my real purpofe, and learnt, with the highest pleaSure, that he was in orders, and had held' the living he now enjoyed many years, that he had constantly reSided upon it, was universally beloved by the poor, Sor his great humanity and tenderneSs, and equally So by the gentry Sor his piety and learning ; that his lady was a most deServing woman, yet living, and that they had no other children than two daughters, who Sor duty, modesty, SenSe, and SweetneSs of diSpoIition, were reSpefted by their elders, and held up as a pattern to their young intimates; this part of the inquiry you will naturally conceive
must
192 THE .ENGLISH MERCHANT.
must have afforded me the highest Sa
tisfadlion imaginable.
I had still one material point to learn, and that was, whether either and which of the lovely listers had formed any engagements; I did not venture to assc this question direcstly, but hinted that Such amiable young ladies could not fail to have many admirers in So gay a city.
This remark was very generally aS-fented to, but in whatever company I ventured to drop the hint, it was never followed up with aiiy thing like an af-fimation: the reply it generally produced was, that Mr. and Mrs. Smith were fcrupuloufiy nice and obServant into what company they entered, or even occasionally met, which. So far from appearing to be the least restraint upon their aftions, appeared to be
equally

equally natural to their diSpofitions and cast oSthinking.”
\
The man who has felt a Sincere attachment Sor a lovely amiable woman, alone can conceive the plealure I felt at the reSult oSmy inquiries: I deSerted the rooms and public walks entirely, devoting mySelS to private cogitations, or to Some Secluded walk or ride.
At lenorth the time I had allowed
mySelS in order to prepare my lovely
Lucy to expedt to hear Surther from
me came, and immediately aSter break-
Sast on the appointed day I addressed a
letter to Mr. Smith, with every inSor-

prefumed were affected, and her whole lystem nervous in a very great degree; ,shc might, however, he Said, remain

After taking a light Supper we prepared to retire; the houfekeeper ae-quaintest Mrs. Smith that her lady had given the necessary and proper directions for every thing against our arrival, and that her orders were to con-fider her lister as her mistreSs, and in every thing conSult her pleaSure and convenience.
The apartments allotted for our uSc were Spacious, and elegantly furnished, wishing our dear girls as eaSy a night as their agitated Ipirits could admit of,
we

we retired to our chamber, refletsting on the inScrutable ways oS Providence, that it should pleaSe his power to work So great a change in the mind of this
o	o
unhappy woman, Srom whoSe hand Sor many years we had not once been obliged with a Single line.
WiththeSe refiedtions I laid my head
upon the pillow, anxioufly wishing Sor the
morning.
lest any thing should unfortunately deprive us oS the happi-neSs oSSeeing her, oS Ipeaking peace to her afHi(sted mind.
The morning at length appeared, we breakfasted early, and about ten o’clock the worthy phySician came: After having made the necessary inquiries of her woman, how she passed the night, &c. &c. he defired her to meri-tion to her lady that he had paid her an early viSit; this was no Sooner done,
than

than he was requested to walk up, which he immediately did, and Sound her exceedingly low, though perSedtly collected and Senfible j aSter Some little time he ventured to aSk her when she expedled her Sister and Samily.
I thank you most kindly, my dear Dr. Grainger,” she replied, in a low voice, Sor all your kind Solicitude, but I begin to be apprehenfive that happineSs will be very shortly out of my power to receive; I feel ruy dissolution approaching fast, I wish they had complied with my request, and left their home upon the receipt of my letter; but I have perhaps offended beyond forgivenels: Oh, I have been cruel in the extreme,”
‘‘Compofe your Ipirits, my dear Madam, take down a little of this draught, which I have purpofely

brought in my pocket,” which she instantly did, when obServing her more compoSed and tranquil, he Said, perhaps Mr. and Mrs. Smith may be nearer than you imagine they are.’
She Sighed very deep, and Seizing hold oS his hand, exclaimed, deceive nOt my hopes, as in your hour oS need you wish Sor peace, for mercy.”
Utterly unable any longer to Subject her to the distreSs she evidently Selt, he rang the bell, and turning to the ler-vant, deSired her to beg Mr. and Mrs. Smith to walk up stairs, and then turning round to Mrs. Hamilton, pronounced they were below. ‘‘Then heaven Support me through this last trial, and I shall yield my Ipirit in peace to the merciSul diSpoSal oS an all wiSe and benevolent Being.”

By this time Mrs. Smith approached her bed fide, and removing the curtains with her hand, beheld her dying lister: Utterly unable; to Support the Sight, she dropped her head upoff the pillow: My angelic patient had just power to utter, ‘‘ forgive me, Lucy, O Sorgive your repentant lister,” and without a groan expired.
The phySician immediately stew to the assistance oS Mrs. Smith, and by the help of the Servants removed her to her chamber, when, by the aid oS proper cordials he recovered her, when finding she was a little compoSed, he adviSed her to loSe a little blood, to which she readily conSented, and indeed it was with the greatest difficulty I could Support mySelf upon my Seet, though Srom the duties oS my office I frequently attend at theSe affedbing trials.

In one of his morning rambl
es
in the
little hamlet that Surrounds my feat, he had Sat down, as was his custom, when he felt himSelf fatigued, at the foot of a large venerable oak, to amufe

himSelf in reading Some few passages from a Savorite author, when he found his meditation interrupted by a voice at Some Small distance Srom where he was Seated; this naturally, while it Surprised him, awakened his curioSity, and though he is Superior to the mean-neSs of listening for a moment to any private conversation, he felt himSelf unaccountably urged to remain unobserved.
The parties were a young man and maiden, the Son and daughter of two of my tenants; this young couple, who had Singled out that retirement to vent their mutual grief on the dire necessity of their humble state; the young man lamented, with much feeling, the inability of his father to place him in a Small farm adjoining the one he occupied ; and his mistreSs, the unkindneSs of her parents, who, though able to

the accomplishment oS their wishes, had no dilpofition to do So; aSter exchanging mutual promises oS uncea-Sing regard, they were on the point oS Separating, when observing their intention, he quitted his concealment and approached 'them.
On their obServing him, they were both astonished, and Seemingly much hurt, when he addressed them nearly in the Sollowing manner.
\
You will both of you, I hope, pardon this interruption on your privacy, had I observed you on my coming to this Ipot, I should most assuredly have quitted it Sor Some other part, equally Suited to my contemplation, and leSc you to the enjoyment oS your mutual passion j however, I am not altogether Sorry that Sate has thrown me in the way oS learning your attachment and

If they were no little astonished before,. their astonishment was now greatly increased; the young woman trembled very much, and turned instantly
t
pale, which her lover obServing Seized her in his arms, and placed her gently on a bank that was opportunely near him.
She
THE ENGLISH MERCHANT. CLS^
She Soon recovered herSelf, which her lover perceiving, he leSt her, and advancing towards him, making not an ungraceful bow. Said, ‘^that your appearance. Sir, when we conSidered ourlelves alone, hath greatly SurpiSed
this young woman and equally mySelf, is unnecessary for me to declare, your observation must have convinced you that it has done So; that alarm we could have conquered ; but the interest,you So nobly take in the happineSs of Such entire strangers, fills my heart with the most lively Sentiments oS gratitude and relpedl; my amiable Sally’s charadler and deportment will, I am confident, upon an inquiry being made, raiSe her in your opinion, and I humbly hope and conceive I shall be found with no other real or imputed Saults than are common to my youth.”
Harry
234 the ENGLISH MERCHANT.
Harry minuting down in his pocket book their names and stations, and wishing them a happy issue to their difficulties, he returned home.
An unuSual concern dwelt for Some days upon his Spirits, which obierving, I inquired into the caufe : He blushed and heSitatedj—at last he Said, Will Mr. Manley pardon me if I wish for a time to conceal what has made me uneafy; I am under a pressing occafion for three hundred pound, but I intend that the fum your goodneSs advances monthly, shall from this time be twenty pounds only, instead of fifty, for it is not proper for me to expert fuch a considerable Sum, without lessening my pocket expences, ’till Such time as I shall have cleared away the overcharge.”
This
THE ENGLISH MERCHANT. 235
This diScolirSe oSHarry’s struck me Sorcibly, but embarraffed him infinitely more; vshich, in order to difpel, pulling out my pocket book, I gave him that Sum in fifty pounds bank, faying, that whatever was his engagement, or
00	^
I was, though entirely a stranger to it, perfectly Satisfied he stood in no need of an excufe; but that I would inSist upon his having for his pocket no leSs a Sum than he always had; a tear of Senfibility stood in his eye, which wiping away with his hand, he pressed mine to his lips, and instantly retired.
He was more chearful the following day, and when he returned from his walk I thought I never obferved him before So happy; he had, in the interval, made the inquiry after the young man and his mistrefs, and found So much to approve and admire, that on

their meeting at the appointed time he expressed his SatisSadlion in very strong terms, and inSisted on attending them to his mistreSs’s Sather’s, which they made no difficulty oS doing, when it Sortunately happened the old man was at home ; but on their way there he called upon the young man’s fire, and deSired he would attend them, which, though he was unable to assign any reaSon Sor, he nevertheless complied with the request.
When turning himSelf round to the father oS the maiden, he Said, I have learnt from this young man, who wishes to wed your daughter, that your principal and indeed only objedion, is his inability to Stock a neighbouring little farm: On your part, addressing him-SelS to the Sather of the young man, I am inclined to believe you have not

I never entertained any but prudent objeftions, which aroSe from the humbleneSs oS my state, nor do I think that my honest neighbour has any if I could do a little more for William than at prelent I can Ipare, therefore I think the young people must wait still Providence puts it my power to compleat their wishes.”
If things are precifoly in this state,” Harry immediately laid to the father of the girl, “ what do you propofe to give with your daughter ? I attend here as William’s friend.”
The old men were both equally Sur-prifed at this difcourSe, but not doubting from Harry’s appearance, and the interest he appeared to have, that he

This I own astonished me no little : and though I at once conceived how they had been dilpofed of^ yet I felt a defire to know who the deferving per-Son might be : I diredlly ordered up the man who had attended the fair, and questioned him as to the notes, whether he knew the man whom he had taken them of, or whether he coiild deScribe his perfon, as they were the only fifty pound notes he had received. Though the young man, he Said, was a stranger, he could deScribe him Sufficiently to any perSon who had any

Great Ormond-Streeti Bloomjbury,
DEAR SIR,
T
HE letter I had the honor before to write to you, acquainted you with the dissolution oS Mrs. Hamilton, the morning aster our arrival at her houle, which has, I make not the least doubt, been received; this will Serve to acquaint you with every thing that has fince occurred.
The
THE ENGLISH MERCHANT. 245
The Sollowing day, taking the worthy Dodtor with me, I called upon Meff. Drummonds, and delivered the letter I had previoufiy taken Srom the eScrutoire oS the deceaSed lady, to one oSthe partners, who immediately upon the peruSal, retired into an inner ’count-ing-houSe, but very quickly returned with her will, (for So the Superscription indicated it to be) and delivered it into my hands: I obServed Doftor Granger was pershnally known to that gentleman, which may accoiint Sor" his • ready compliance with the purport of

the letter I gave him, mySelf being So entirely a stranger. Upon this we re-turned to Great OrrnOnd-Street, when
a	^	•	a .	•	...	.	^	^	■«	>
the Dodtor prepared (first paying Mrs.

Smith a viSit) to stake his leave; this, I Said, I could only conditionally comply with, that as his engagements were of a nature not to be dilpenSed with, his hour should be agreeable to us;

but I must beg as a particular favor, he would
give
me his company; indeed, I Said, I could by no means excuSe his coming, his preSence being absolutely necessary; as I propoSed aSter dinner to break the Seal of the will; and should earnestly request of him to read it, that if there should be any particular diredtions relpedling the diipoSal of the body, immediate orders should be given to carry them into effedt; he acceded to the propriety of my propofal, and naming four o’clock retired.
Mrs. Smith gave to the houfe-keeper the necessary orders for dinner, diredling it to be ready by half past four o’clock, in order to allow for any unexpedted delay Dr. Granger might meet with : The time came Somewhat earlier than the Dodtor appeared, he
apologized
THE ENGLISH MERCHANT. 1247
apologized to Mrs. Smith Sor being Some twenty minutes after his appointment, observing, proSeshonal gentlemen very rarely could keep their engagements So exadlly as they were defirous of doing j we now fat down and made (the perturbations of our Ipirits con-fidered) a tolerable chearful meal.
After the cloth was removed, and my daughters had each drank half a glaSs of wine, a quantity they rarely exceeded, they expressed a wish to retire, which their mother and mySelf were the more willing to comply with
any
fresh
not defiring to occaSion distrels to their feeling minds, which had before Suffered no little, fince they had left the more tranquil Scenes which uSually Surrounded them at the ParSon-age: Pouring mySelf out a glaSs ofi excellent old Port, I passed the bottle to the Dodlor, defiring he would be fo

that nature frequently required its assistance, and that her own particular ^Situation at that time made it absolutely necessary she should not deny herSclS the entire uSe oS it: She felt the just-nels of his observation, and to convince him she did, giving me an affeftionate stnile, drank it immediately off to his health; he felt the full force of the compliment paid to his advice, made a relpeftful inclination with his head, and wishing Mrs. Smith and myfelfall possible happinefs, prepared to break the Seal of Mrs. Hamilton’s will, which having done, he read as follows.

When Doctor Granger had finished
reading the will, he immediately filled
■
Mrs. Smith’s glaSs, and very kindly entreated her to drink the whole, or at least the greatest part; she drank rather more than half and instantly retired to give her feelings vent, and I assure you, my dear Sir, neither Doctor Granger

The Doctor Sat with me Some little time, when pleading the urgency oS his engagements, he hook his leave, pro-mifing to call upon us while we continued in town, as Srequently as he conveniently could, we drank tea quickly after, and I exerted all my little influence to balm Mrs. Smith’s mind, and my dear girls were alSo much affecsted, though they were not present, their mother I have fince learnt, had given them the particular heads of the will; the parts where they were So kindly remembered by their mother’s Sister, notwithstanding her neg-

After tea I rang for the footman, and direded him to call upon Mr. West the Undertaker, and fend him immediately to me, he did So, and shortly after a very decent perSon about forty years of age, made his appearance ; I told him I preSumed he knev/ of the lofs he had fustained in his worthy and relpedable neighbour, to which he bowed his assent; adding, that he should assuredly have waited upon her family, but learning we had arrived only one day, and had, from what he heard, come a great distance, he thought he could not, with any propriety, venture: to call before the following morning; and that Such was his intention if he had not been favored with my commands this evening; I then gave him the nectary and proper orders, and
told
THE ENGLISH MERCHANT. 259

told him the day and time I would Settle with him hereafter: making me a relpectful bow, he took his leave.
Proper orders were immediately given for our own and family’s mourning, all of which were compleat and ready before the day appointed for her interment; Mr. West had given proper notice to the Ministers of the leveral parishes, who, together with Doctor Granger, myfelf, Mrs. Smith and daughters, and fervants, attended the body of their kind lady to the family vault of Mr. Hamilton, on the eighth day from her deceaSe, at an early hour in the afternoon ; the lervice being performed, the gentlemen returned in the lame manner to Ormond- Street, when after refreshing with a glafs of wine and cake, I put into the hands of each of the Ministers the fum bequeath-

Doctor Granger very kindly favored us with his company to Supper, and staid with us still past eleven o’clock, when he took a polite and friendly leave of Mrs. Smith, my daughters, and mySelf, promising to call in upon us as often as he conveniently could; I thanked him very kindly for his friendly attention, and pressed him not to fail to favor us with his company as frequently as he could find opportunities So to do.

MR. SMITH IN CONTINUATION.
Since I concluded my letter to my relpectable Sriend, having finished my tea, and chatted halS an hour with Mrs. Smith- and my girls, I took up the evening paper, which I have constantly taken in Since my arrival in town, as a relaxation for mySelfand an amuSement for Mrs. Smith when not otherwise engaged; aSter I have peruSed all the Soreign news, which at this time is
o	'
more than uSually interesting to every perSon oS Seeling and reflection, 1 run my eye over our domestic news, as I con fid er it Sull as proper to pay Some little regard to what pastes as it were at one’s own door, as to be So very So-
Sicitous
\
THE ENGLISH MERCHANT. 263
iicitous about our neighbours, who live on the other fide that little gulph that makes all our Security; we have every reaSon at this critical period to exult in our happy Situation, happy and most favored ofisses, at once the Seat of liberty and independence; here every man, however low, however humble his lot, is equally protected in his life and property, with the proudest Peer that basses in the Sunshine of court favor; the wiSdom of our legissature hath placed a firm and fixt barrier in the independence of our Judges, awed by no Minister, controuied by no power; Sole arbiters of justice, they administer impartially to all their individual claims.
But to return to my intended pur-pofe, having Sufficiently tired myfelf with perufing what was very little interesting, I do QCcaSionassy, as a relief
from
264 THE ENGLISH MERCHANT.
from more Serious Subjects, take a short glance at the different advertisements that are So numeroussy offered to the public; when, at one corner, near the bottom, a name struck my eye that I had Some Saint recollection of, and though I was in the action oS laying down the paper, my curioSity induced me to peruSe it, v/hich having done more than once, I was convinced the perSon So anxiousty inquired aSter could be no other than your faithSul Mr. James; the pleaSure this idea gave me was So affecting, that my emotion was noticed not only by Mrs. Smith, but my daughters, and I then read aloud to them as Sollows.
“IS James Scot, Son oSJames and Mary, formerly of Bridgnorth, in the County of Salop, but Since of Much

OPINION OF THE REVIEW,
This Novel exhibits a good pidlure oS ancient times and manners, and in not a Sew instances abounds with pathetic and interesting events 5 the language is eafy and elegant 5 the story is too complicated for us to give an ac-
count of it, as it would take up more Space than is allotted

My dear mother received that pleasure, but in a manner So awSul and distressing, that it perSe<5Uy overcame her.—My poor aunt, had it pleaSed the Almighty to have Spared her longer, would have been an increaSe to our general happineSs; the diSpofition of mind, in which she lived for Some short time previous to her dissolution, Sushciently evince the thorough change in her Sentiments, and that she was studious to do away her former negledl,

How exquisitely painful, yet grateful, must the light of her have been to poor Mrs. Hammilton’s departing Spirits ! for though your mamma, my dear Lucy, had no power to utter a fingle word, in reply to the dying Lady’s prayer, yet her arrival So opportunely. So affedingly critical, must have conveyed to the mind of the deceaSed

To yourSelS and Polly I have little Sarther to remark, Save that, while the memory of the affedlionate aunt will ever live reSpe<5ted by me Sor her goodneSs to her nieces : I cannot help thinking that fortune to my amiable friends will operate like an alloy to purer metals; your native and intrinsic charms, were before Sufficient to gain you the admiration and love of the Senfible part of the male Sex, while the addition of fortune will

My amiable friend has So Sufficiently vindicated the female charadler from the unmanly attempts of the gay and dissipated libertine, that she has left me little to add more than my perfecst coincidence of idea upon the fubjedt, convinced of the fadb, I can only lament the miSery it never fails to entail upon the unhappy vidim of its choice.
Surely, my dear friend, there must be much depravity in the male world, when what might be naturally expeded to claim their reSped and protedion, induces a contrary condud.

I have only to hope, as I See no immediate remedy Sor the evil, and the conSequent miSery it produces, that a proper share of horror and remorSe may overtake them in this life, that they may expiate while here, as far as contrition can, the pangs they have occaSioned unhappy women; and that they may at last, if Heaven in mercy lengthens out their days, live convinced, that true happineSs can only ariSe from the pradice of virtue. I will not pain my Lucy’s SenSibility So much, as to impute SenSatipns that she does not feel, nor for a moment entertain the idea that Sornmerville, or the

Pray make my relpedtful compliments to your papa and mamma, and give my kind love to Polly. May she continue to poffeSs the Same degree of fpirit she now does j indeed there is much truth in my young friend’s remark. My Lucy can never make an indifferent figure whenever she may be placed ; but rather, on the contrary, grace the most elevated; for what can grace the highest ranks in life So eminently as when, to the

princely, and deServe in this age of expence every possible consideration.
I will not flatter you that her Ladyship is dying for you, tho’ I believe you are Superior to \vounding her delicacy ; but however that may be, till I know the state of your heart, as well as your inclination to the propoSed match, you may Suggest what you pleaSe, but no discovery will you have from me.

The manner in which I have communicated this Subjedt to you, must Sufficiently shew the interest I have in it. I have been a widower iriany years, arid have not the least intention to marry again; all my deSire is to live to See you happily Settled, if you have no previous engagement (and if you have, I shall think your condudt ungenerous in the extreme) Set off immediately for my Seat,, when not to wound Lady Amelia’s feelings, who from what I could gather from the Earl, her father,is an entire stranger to his propoSals, though it is but natural to conceive they are reSolved upon, from a convidion, that though

The complinients paid to Dr. Grainger pleaSed me greatly : I relpedt him for the humanity of his charadler, the urbanity of his manners, her domestics have every reaSon in the world to relpedt the memory of their deceaSed Lady; she has not only considered their humble Services and stations in a very feeling manner, but with great kindneSs and consideration alSo, a certain proof in their favour of their having filled their different fitiia-

Mrs. Hartley and Caroline very Senfibly raiSs Mrs. Smith and her lovely daughters ; indeed the latter Seldom leaves home, oSten declaring the agreeable walks (her young friends abSent) have no longer any charms for her; that she Seels more pleaSure in confining herSelf within doors, to her muSxc, books, and writing, and I really believe her correspondence is chiefly with the amiable Lucy and Polly, for whom she entertains ail the affedtion oS a Sister ; indeed they have Srom childhood been inseparable.

The accomplishments of her Ladyship’s mind, I, have not the least doubt, correSpond with the lovely exterior, and yet, my- dear Lord> notwithstanding theSe charms, theSe accomplishments, I felt for Lady Amelia no other than the great reSped her birth and amiable qualities inSpired; unmixed with that paffion your Lord-ship would wish to inSpire me with.

Were I, my dear Lord, Srom motives of aggrandizement to Suffer mySelS to be prevailed upon to Solicit the honour of Lady Amelia’s hand, not induced So to do from exceSs of regard, I should not only deServedly merit all the evils that must attend an union So entered into, but most justly the hatred and contempt oS her Ladyship, Sor having deprived her oS the opportunity oS Sorming a connexion more Suited to her affedlions, more deSerVing her charms. Men oS Small fortune are, I will grant, my Lord, too frequently induced, the eafier to acquire independence, to Sacrifice every confi-deration, to their mean and mercenary views, they have however Something, contemptible as it is, to plead; but what cxcuSe can be offered Sor the man of independent fortune, should he stoop So low, from motives of avarice and ambition, to accept the hand and heart

Certainly not: Then most assuredly there cannot be upon earth a more deSpicable charad er, and as 1 am convinced there does not breathe a man of strider honour than your Lordship, nor one that deSpiSes a little a(5lion more, I think I shall not run the least rilk of your diSpleaSure, if from the motives, before explained, I decline the distinguished honour you was Solicitous of procuring for my dear anti honoured

aSraid I have little elSe than my acknowledgments to make, perSuaded as I am that I can never make a Suitable return. The account you have Savoured me with, reSpedting Harry’s generoSity to the yoyng couple, afforded me great pleaSure, as it was the pure feeling of his mind that induced the adlion, the lively interest he took in another’s happinels that gave Spring to the impulse, and made him wretched till he made them blest. I do not wish him to acquire a habit of expence or expensive pleaSures, but he never cost me three hundred pounds that save me more SatisSailion.
From the charadler the young couple bear, he may have probably laid the foundation of all their future hap-pineSs, a conSciouSneSs of which cannot fail to leave an agreeable impreffion upon his own mind; for what higher
pleaSure

DEAR SIR,
This Serves to acquaint my very.
obliging Sriend cS my SaSe arrival in town, on the evening oS the third day after my leaving Scarborough. The Sollowing morning I waited on Sir George Bingley, and concerted with him on the most likely means to discover the reSidence of Mr. Smith
3
and
THE ENGLISH merchant. 87
and his Samily, and, in order to diSpel the gloom that hung over my mind, I Spent the day there with him, and accompanied him in the evening to Drury Lane Theatre, to See Mr. Sheridan’s Comedy of the School for Scandal: The houSe was, as it always is, when the manager brings that favourite piece forward, very crowded. We had Seats which had been previoussy engaged in the fide boxes. The first three adts passed over with that degree of applauSe, that uSually attends this performance ; after that time the doors are opened, at what the town calls half price, which generally occafions no little inconvenience through all parts of the houle to the audience, who had till then been peaceably Seated. Observing in one of the front boxes a very genteel man, rather advanced in years, remonstrating with two young bucks, who appeared
to
88
THE ENGLISH MERCHANT.
to be men of Sashion, but who had most certainly made too free with the bottle, against the impropriety oS their advancing any nearer the Sront, as they
greatly incommoded his party, which consisted of three Ladies, but lyithout any effedt, Sor one of them still persisted in Seating himSelS between them, and without paying any regard to the distreSs he occafioned the Ladies, he Sprang over the Seat, and Sat down. This rudeneSs So alarmed one of the Ladies, that she Screamed and Sainted. This piece of ungentleman-like behaviour awakened all my reSentment, when hastily leaving my Seat, 1 made my way to the box: But how can I paint the SurpriSe that leized my whole Srame, on my approaching the box, to discover in the Lady that had Sainted my lovely, adorable Lucy.

at the rudeneSs I had been a Spedlator to, my reSentment now knew no bounds» Springing instantly Sorward, I Seized him by the collar, and without allowing him time to recover Srom his astonishment, I drew him into the lobby : His Sriend immediately Sollowed, and by this time Sir George had come round to the Sront boxes: he was very SenSible I must have strong reaSons for my violent interference; in a whiSper I made him acquainted who the party were, when his furpriSe and reSentment were little short of mine. This behaviour of mine naturally occafioned Some warm expressions, which terminated by exchanging addresses j I now entered the box, in order to apologize to the Gentleman for my interference, which I did, and told him I had the honour of being ssightly known to two Ladies who were of his party.”
My

THE ENGLISH MERCHANT.
My lovely Lucy, by the attention oS her Sister and the eider Lady, had now recovered herSelS, when, turning her head, in order to thank me for my polite attention, she then, Sor the first time, discovered who the was that had So effedlually interSered. I was apprehenSive it might diSorder her again, which, to prevent, iS poffi-ble, I addressed mySelf to the Gentlemen, vsho very politely made me room for the remainder of the evening. — Before the piece finished I had,the hap-pineSs to diScover my lovely charmer was pretty w'ell compoSed ; indeed Sufficiently So to thank me in a very feeling manner for the protedion I had afforded her. With the Gentleman exchanged addresses.
Sir George placed himSelf in the adjoining box, and appeared Sor the

remainder of the evening deeply in thought. The play over, Sor they did not stay the entertainment, they prepared to move, when I begged permission of the Gentlemen to attend the Ladies to their carriage, which was granted with much Seeming pleaSure and reSpedV.
V
I begged my lovely girl to do me the honour of accepting of my arm, as there was no little crowd, which, with a becoming Smile, she, without any hefitation, accepted. The amiable Polly laid hold of her Sister’s arm.
We passed on without any molestation. Having come to the carriage, I bowed reSpedtfuily to all the Ladies : I paid then my reSpedts to the Gentleman, when the Servant shut the door of the carriage, and drove off. I now returned to Sir George, who, as well
as
92 THE ENGLISH MERCHANT.
as mySelS, had lost all relish for the after piece ; we therefore agreed to return to his houSe, and went immediately to the carriage for that purpoSe. All the way back we remained fiient.
When we arrived there we Sat down toSupper, but with very little appetite, as at least on my part, and my reSpedlable friend, was uncommonly Serious, which observing, I jokingly Said, “ I wished
the occurrence of the evening had not
/
affedled him more than he might chuSe to declare.”
This remark raiSed him from his reverie, when he instantly replied,
My dear Sommerville, I will own, with all the openneSs that our friendship demands, I am indeed affedled : I am wounded very deeply with one of
the lovely women you protected this
evening,

evening, and all my apprehenfion, is my attachment may interSere with yoLir’s, Sor I am yet a stranger to which oS thoSe lovely girls you have given your affedlions; the only difference of your politeneSs and attention paid to either in preSerence, appeared to re Suit from your feeling to what the eldest had Suffered ; but whether that young Lady or her Sister claims your attachment, I am as yet unacquainted with.”
My dear Sir George, in order to remove from the breast oS my friend a Single pang, the Lady who fainted, and who honoured me with taking my arm, is my lovely Lucy.”
‘‘ I am happy, my dear Sommer-ville, and thank you for your open declaration; it is her lovely Sister that
has touched my heart; but had she,
unhappily
94- THE ENGLISH MERCHANT.
unhappily Sor me, been, the mistreSs of your affedlions, your prior claim would, whatever it had cost me, compelled me to relincjuish all pretenSions, as it is, we may be both happy.^’
This conversation restored us in a manner to ourSelves, and we Ipent the rest oS the evening in perfedt harmony; upon looking at the card that had been given me in exchange Sor mine by the Gentleman who had behaved So unbecomingly, I Sound his name to be Sir Timothy Lovechace, oS Squana-Hall, in the county of Berks, and in a line below. Cannon Coffee-Houle, Charing-CroSs ; putting it up into my pocket-book, I examined the one given me by the Gentleman who had the lovely listers, and their Sriend under his care, and Sound it to be the card of Dr. Grainger, a charadter univerSally
admired,

admired, not more Sor his great shill than his humanity and Seelings. It gave me great pleaSure to find I should have an opportunity to pay my reSpedts to So deServing a charadter, ASter Spending a more cheerSul evening than I at one time expedled, I took my leave oS Sir George, promising, aSter I had waited upon the Dodtor in the morning, to drop into his houSe beSore I returned home; and now I have to concert the most eligible manner to gain an interview of my lovely Lucy, previous to my addreshng mySelf to Mr. Smdth, which, iS I cannot do in the courSe oS to-morrow, I shall certainly addreSs a line to that Gentleman.

The diSpoSition of my dear aunt’s fortune, reSpedting my parents, is the circumstance that affedls your Lucy’s mind the most; Polly and mySelf, while we entertain a very lively SenSe of her goodneSs to us, were both happy before, possessing as we did the affedlions of our ever honoured papa and mamma,
we never felt a wish to be the least independent of their controul j how far our humble qualities may recommend us to the deServing part of the other Sex I will leave to be discovered by themSelves; the experience of our parents will guard us from becoming a prey to the mercenary, and to the man of fortune and Sentiment our little fortunes will ceaSe to bd an objedl.
It was my intention, when I fat down
to write to my amiable MiSs Hartley,
>
to have finished my letter for the post that leaves town to night; but being
THE ENGLISH MERCHANT. 99
engaged to go to , the Theatre, I must deSer doing it till to-morrow, as the Servant has just given me notice that Dr. Grainger, who is So obliging as to attend us there, is now below. Ostr party confists oS my mamma. Dr. Grainger, Polly and Self. Places have been previoussy engaged for us in that part of the houSe called the front boxes; therefore till morning, my dear Caroline, adieu, adieu.
Well, my dear Caroline, with the morning I reSume my pen, to acquaint my amiable friend with every thing that has occurred in the courSe of last night. Dr. Grainger, my mamma, Polly and mySelf, went to Drury-Lane Theatre in the Dodlor’s carriage. We had three feats on the lowest row, and one on the Second. The houSe was exceedingly full of very genteel company ; the brilliancy of the chande-

100 THE ENGLISH MERCHANT.
liers, the elegant Suporters and paintings on the panncls, Sormed a very beautiSul Scene to engage the admiration oS your young friend’s party and mySelS; the numerous band that filled a very Spacious orchestra playing at intervals, gave a relieS to the fight, by engaging the ear till the curtain drew up, and then an univerSai stillnels prevailed through all parts oS the houSe till aSter the third a6l, when the doors all over the houSe were constantly opening and shutting, which the Dodlor gave us to understand was always the
caSe at that part of the piece, for the admiffion of Such who had not come in time to See the commencement.
He had just done favouring us with this uSual custom of the Theatres, when two genteel-dreffed young men were pressing forward greatly to the inconvenience oS the company. Dr. Grainger remonstrated to the foremost
oS
THE ENGLISH MERCHANT. lOI
oS them on the impropriety of their behaviour, declaring there was no room in front, and that farther he must not preSs to come; that the Ladies occupied no more room than was common to the like number, and that he would not Suffer his party to be incommoded.
This, instead of having the defired effeft. Seemed to inflame his Spirits, which I thought at the time were but too elevated: However, he did not give me much leiSure to make any farther observations, for, to my great amazement and distrefs, he placed his hand upon my shoulder, and Sprang instantly down between Polly and me, which had Such an effedl that I fainted away. My mother, lister, and indeed all the company, were attentive to recover me, which was Soon effeded.
F3
and
102 THE ENGLISH MERCHANT.
and what helped to contribute to keep me So, the rude wretch had disappeared, how or why Polly could not tell, being So engaged with me; but Dr. Grainger Said, a very genteel dressed young man, who had just beSore entered the box, no Sooner obServed what had passed, than Seizing him instantly by the collar, drew him over the Seats into the lobby oS the houSe.
Just as he had finished this remark the stranger entered, and in a manly, reSpedlSul voice, apologized to Dr. Grainger Sor his interSerence, Saying he had obServed, with pain Srom his Seat, in the fide boxes, the ungentleman-like behaviour we had experienced ; but that it was not till he entered our box that he discovered the Lady who had been So inSulted, he had the
‘honour oS being ssightly known to.
This
THE ENGLISH MERCHANT. IO3
This Dr. Grainger related when we arrived at home, for my mind had been too agitated to attend to their diScourSe, though I heard Sufficient to convince me my proteDor had returned to our box ; I felt it incumbent upon me to Summon up Sufficient Spirit to thank him in the best manner I could, which, turning mySelS round to do with all the grace and eaSein my power, '.Dh! my dear Caroline, judge my SurpriSe, it was Mr. Sommerville’s Self, to whom I was indebted for this piece of gallantry j the rudeneSs I had just expe-riencedScarcely affected me more. So unexpected a meeting, mySelS the object of his attention. Scarce left me power to pay him my acknowledgments, which, in a low voice, having done, I drop’d him a coiirteSy, and Sat down.

What
104 the ENGLISH MERCHANT.
What my dear mamma obServed I am as yet unacquainted with : I hope I was not greatly conSuSed, or, iS I was, that it will be placed to the agitation oS Spirit I had just undergone. My dear Polly was little leSs SurpriSed than mySelS: However, keeping my eye steadily fixed on the perSormance I had, beSore the piece was ended, recovered mySelS tolerably well, we then prepared to retire at the request
oS
my mamma
Dr. Grainger and
Mr. Sommerville exchanged cards j when the former preSenting his arm to my mother, Mr. Sommerville, making me a reSpedtSul bow, entreated to take me under his protedtion j there being a very great crowd, I Saw no impropriety in complying with his request : Indeed I thought I Selt he deServed to be obliged, thereSore dropping him a flight courteSy, I Suffered him to lead me through the throng.
Polly
THE ENGLISH MERCHANT. IO5
Folly taking my arm, we got Safe to the carriage, when making my mother, Dr. Grainger, Polly, and mySelS, each a reSpedlSul bow, he took his leave.
The DoDor was employed the whole of our way home in commending the Spirit and polite behaviour oS the stranger, for he had not yet examined the card he had received. My mother, aSter expreshng her concern at the inconvenience the worthy Do6tor had Sustained, in conSequence of the rude intrusion, expressed herSelS in very Savourable terms towards the Gentleman, whoSe Spirit and addreSs had relieved us from it, declaring, at the dole of her observation, a more genteel polite bred Gentleman she never recolleded to have Seen, possessing at once that Spirit that marks the male charader, with all the SoftneSs of diS-pofition that wins and engages ours.

Shall I own to my dear Caroline, that the Sentiments my mamma entertained for Mr. Sommerville affedted me no little I received a pleaSure to hear that perSon Spoken well of, who had engaged my esteem, and appeared Solicitous to deServe my regard. We had now reached home, when my papa urged the worthy Dodtor in Such strong terms to Savour him with his company to Supper, that he yielded to his request. ASter the cloth was removed. Dr. Grainger related, in Sew words, the lubstance that I have more minutely detailed to my Caroline; my Sather expressed his concern at the inconvenience Dr. Grainger had met with, and the trouble the intrufion had oc-cafioned him, when the latter putting his hand into his waistcoat pocket drew out the card that had been given him by the stranger, and read aloud his addreSs, Henry Sommerville, ESq;

My mamma went with us to our chamber, but made no inquiry, at which I was not a little pleaSed j Sor though I would not, upon any account or occafion, have concealed any thing that had passed, I should have blushed at my Sormer concealment, innocent as I think it, the more So as I have not entered into any engagement, or ever had a thought of doing So, without the entire approbation oS my parents. My dear mamma gave each of us a kiSs, and wishing us very affedlionately a good night, returned to the parlour.

I like the honest plainneSs and fim-plicity that marks the character of Mr. Harris : He entertains the highest re-Spe6t for the worthy Dodlor and his excellent Lady; but when he Speaks of the lovely Lucy and Polly, he is perfedtly in raptures ; nor is he leSs attached to his reSpeClable landlord and lady, and their elegant lovely daughter, theSe are his own words; for I have never yet, in any of my walks or rides,

None of the beautiful females that grace this place with their preSence, have as yet occaSioned me the least pain j their charms, all lovely as they are, have not reached my heart, though they claim my admiration and reSpedl; but why do I dwell upon this Subjedl, who have So much reaSon to be happy ?

DEAR CAROLINE,
N my last I made you acquainted with every thing that happened the evening w'e went to the Theatre, and the conversation that enSued upon and aster our return home. The next morning we met at the uSual hour in the breakSast parlour, which passed over much to my wishes without any

remark upon the incidents of the preceding evening. About eleven o’clock my papa wished my mamma a good morning Sor the preSent, Saying, he had
r
an engagement, but should return by three, being our uSual dinner hour. Polly and mySelS dropped each a cour-teSy, and retired to our apartment to dreSs Sor the day. About Some halS hour after we had So done, our amiable mother entered the room : ASter paying us Some little compliment upon our taste in the diSpofition of our curls and ribbands, &c. taking hold of my hand very affedlionately Said,
I came here, my dear Lucy, to enter into conversation with my amiable daughter, reSpedling the Subjedl that engrossed So much of our thoughts last night, though the rude behaviour of the man, who, in So ungentle manlike a manner, forced his way into the
box

box where we were Seated, deServed the corredlion he met with from every man oS Sentiment and Spirit, yet, my dear Lucy, while I SubScribe with great pleaSure to the manly condu(5t and genteel addreSs oS Mr. Sommerville, I am halS inclined to think he had a more interesting motive than met the eye oS common observation; there was a viSible tenderneSs and distrels about him that did not eScape a parent’s attentive view, when the happi-neSs of a much loved daughter is the SubieD.”
This diScourSe oS my dear mother’s affeded your poor Lucy, as your good SenSe and Seeling will, my dear Caroline, naturally Suggest,, in no Small degree, which she obServing, continued:
“ As it is not my wish to distreSs my dear daughter, but on the contrary
relieve
120 THE ENGLISH MERCHANT.
relieve her mind Srom every thing that may embarraSs it, confident as I am, that whatever motive might induce concealment, no indilcretion will attach to her conduD, I shall proceed to conclude, that Mr. Sommervilie is not #
the entire stranger to my Lucy, that he is to her mother ; the accomplishments he apparently possesses. Super-added to a perSon uncommonly striking and engaging, may be allowed without departing Srom that delicacy (which is the brightest Seature in a Semale cha- '
radler) to have no little influence on
«
the heart oS a young woman. If the application I feel he meditates to make to your dear father shall be found, what I entertain no doubt that it will, reSpec-table,* and deferving every attention, it shall be my part to reconcile your honoured father to his being (giving Polly an arch Smile) the latest acquainted
with
THE ENGLISH MERCHANT. I'll
with what So materially affedted the honour and hanpineSs oShis Samily.”
Unable to Sustain Such goodneSs any longer, I leSt my Seat (Sor I had Sor Some time been unable to stand) and threw mySelf at her Seet, and Sunk my head upon her lap; and then I gave vent to my concern for my weaknefs, in a copious flood of tears. She did not immediately attempt to check the affedling Situation her tenderneSs had placed me in. So that I was permitted to recover by degrees, which having done, in a tremulous voice., I replied,
“ How can I Sufficiently exprels rtiy thanks to my dear mother, for her great goodnefs and affedion to her Lucy; appearances only, my dear mamma, are against me; true, very true, it is, Mr. Sommerville is not the

I now immediately proceeded to deliver my dear mother the letter alluded to, when she kindly raiSed me (Sor I was yet on my knees) and giving me a kiSs, returned it without looking
at it.
Place it again in your pocket-book, my dear Lucy ; at Some Suture time I may, perhaps, defire to read it; to do So now would call in question what I knew to be Superior to dilguiSe, or impeachment, my Lucy’s veracity; let me, my dear, share in future your confidence with Polly; I have miore than a Sister’s interest in my Lucy’s happineSs; my experience of v/hat pastes in life, if it does not add to my

dear daughter’s happineSs, is not calculated to embitter it. Your dear -father, and mySelf have lived ever too happy to draw the Source of our observations from ourSelves ; it is the concern we have Srequently felt for Others that has induced our conclusions,; therefore, my dear, our observations are untindured with the Severity uSual
i
to age, and consequently more calculated for youthSo Saying, giving each of us a kiSs, she retired to her room.
Oh! my dear Caroline, how near have I been incurring the dilpleaSure of the best of mothers, and yet how little had T to diScloSe ! Mr. Sommer-ville So entirely a stranger, and the state of his inclinations So little known re-SpeDing me. Polly, who Supported
herSelf through the parts that most

125
affedled me, is, now the conssidl’s past, diffolved in tears; her apprehenfion Sor her Lucy Supported her then, it^ is the resseciion on maternal tenderneSs that
overcomes her now.
How Seeling kind
and confiderate has my dear mother adled, though no stranger yesterday
to what passed in my breast, she affectionately concealed her Sentiments till the morning, least, aSter the agitations' I had Suffered, her remarks might af-fedl me too deeply. Generous, tender mother! your Lucy will endeavour to
deServe this

honoured Madam', 'you shall share with Polly all my confidence. Secrets I have none; now this Single circumstance is difcloSed, you shall, as you ought, diredt your daughter’s views'and wishes, and steer her little bark Safe into port, Your observations, my

they are the genuine effufion oS a mind well informed,, equally free from prejudice, or weak partiality j they reSuk from great experience, corredted by a judgment Seldom equalled, perhaps never excelled.
My Caroline will pardon her Lucy’s partiality for So amiable a mother. If I am led to give a preference were it v/as an honour to come in competition, the amiable Mrs. Hartley is her Sister in every noble quality and ac-q'uirement, and my lovely friend the perfedt counterpart of her excellent parent. Gay as is this great city, I begin to pant for the retired Scenes we took Such pleaSure to reSort to. Our amuSements were more rational, or at least I am convinced they were more to my taste than any I have yet experienced

jedt.
And here let me inquire into the precise state of my heart and affedlions,. an appeal I never till now had occasion to make, consequently Mr. Som-merville has nothing at preSent to apprehend from a rival. The opportunities I have had of obServins; much

1 am pcrfeistly well convinced my dear and honoured parents will lay no restraint upon my inclinations, it will constitute their principal happineSs to diredl the pashon, leaving, were nature left before, the choice to the individual, k must assuredly increaSe all the joys of life to share them with thoSe we love, and by parity of argument make even the miferies of it more lupporta-ble : Surely, if any thing can lessen distrest, it must flow from the affedlion and feeling of thoSe v;e most esteem and prefer: If general happineSs increaSe the more benefits are diffuSed, why may not the evils of life be diminished

fninished when shared by thoSe we love ? IS it should be Said to bring distreSs and miSery on thoSe we love is utterly against the very idea oS the passion, I will grant it at once, and let the best caSuist of them all make the most oS it; this militates not in the least against my argument: There is a great distindion,. a distindfion, my dear Caroline, not without a difference between the bringing an objedt into distreSs, or the sharing the evils oSlife as they Sail; the one is the wilSul adt of the baSe and unmanly, the other heroic Sentiment flowing purely Srom love and affedlion..

Sir George Bingley, at his houle. Mount-Street, GroSvenor-Square, that Gentleman infisted upon

The Servant was immediately, dilpatched to Secure Seats in the fide boxes, but that it was not till aSter the third a6t that I paid any. particular attention to the fashionable and genteel company that filled almost every part oS the houSe, when observing, the rude and unm.anly behaviour oS a perSon (apparently a Gentleman) I leSt my Seat without even apologizing to my Sriend, unable any. longer to contain my reSentment, though it was not till I entered the box that I discovered how greatly I was interested ia the protedion oS the in-

The Dodlor immediately recognized me, when, riling from his chair, he politely welcomed me to his houfe, inquired very reSpedlfulIy and kindly after your health, and that of Mr. Van Helmont, as it was that Gentleman he. attended when I happened to be pre-fent. I was proceeding to state to that

Gentleman Such particulars reSpedling myfelf, Samily and Sortune, when the Servant Suddenly entered, and announced the arrival of Mr, Smith; this of courSe interrupted our diScourSe, though I little thought at the moment it was-the individual Mr. Smith I So very anxioussy wished to be introduced to; indeed I had not time to revolve this point Sufficiently in my mind before the entrance of the Gentleman put the matter beyond all dilpute, from the strong likeneSs my lovely Lucy bears to her father. After exchanging with Dr. Grainger the ufual compliments and inquiries, he made me a polite obeiSance, which I returned with all the relpedt I could, when Dr. Grainger taking the lead, obServed to Mr. Smith the good fortune his young friend had

I obServed this diScourSe appeared to shrpriSe Mrj Smith not a little, which Dr. Grainger Selt it-incumbent upon himSelS to remove ; this he instantly.effedled in the Sollowing manner.:.
“ Wehave, ,my dear-Sir,” continued, the Dodon “ our mutual acknowledgments to make to this young Gentleman : I am Sure he has laid a very , lasting obligation upon me, which

would kindly allow me the expreffion,

I then related to that Gentleman the-

little incidents that' first brought me.: to the knowledge of that young Lady, and the disappointment that Succeeded, it, upon finding his family had unex-pededly gone for London; that unable • to Support any longer the abSence I. deplored, that I followed them to the capital; that dining the following day with my very reSpedtable friend, Sir George Bingley, that Gentleman en-r

diat what passed there 1 made little doubt but he was acquainted with that my family was, I flattered myfelf^. reSpedlable, my Sortune ample and independent ; that if my pretenfions met the approbation of that Lady’s parents, aqfi was no ways diSagreeable to his amiable daughter, I should esteem it a particular honour and happinefs to
be permitted to Solicit Srom that Lady the distinguiflied honour I afpired to.
Dr. Grainger followed up my remarks, by observing I was (though it had not occurred to him last night) the intimate friend of one of the most independent and refpedtable charadters this kingdom could boast. This kind remark had all its intended effedt, for Mr. Smith instantly advanced towards me, and took me very kindly by the hand, .. Say in

T length I have had the happineSs to meet MiSs Hartley, for a happineSs I shall ever esteem it, as I am inclined to think there was Some-thing peculiarly providential in the circumstances that occafioned it. A Sew mornings back, having mounted my horSe, I was induced to yary my ride, thereSore leaving the road that led to 2 -	the

Having proceeded shout three miles, the road being uncommonly narrow, and oSCon-Sequence much shaded from the over--hanging oS the trees, which at this part were extremely thick and cloSe. Af-Sedted no little by the Solemn stillneSs oS the Scene, I drew my horSe up into a walk, the better to indulge mySelS in the reverie the natural gloom oS the place had produced; when Suddenly all my attention was rouSed at the approach of a horSe Seemingly upon a gallop, and at intervals the Seint Screaming oS a voice. Convinced I had not a moment to loSe, and clapping Spurs to my horSe I continued my way, when at a Sudden turn oS the f oad I perceived a Lady in a green habit exerting

He returned with Some in the crown of his hat, with which I gently Sprinkled her lovely face, and raifed at the Same time her black beaver, the better to receive the air. This had the defired effeD, as I had the happincSs to observe she w'as recovering fash At length she opened a pair of the fweetest blue eyes I had ever Seen j when observing a stranger standing reSpedlfully at her fide, she gently Sighed, and instantly cloSed them, when taking off the outer caSe of my Vv'atch, which w^as-gold, I poured Some water into it, and applied it to her lips.

that I was providentially passing at the instant her horSe, unconScious oS the value oS his lovely charge, had rudely ran off with her; that I had arrived just in time to protedt her from farther injury, by receiving her when falling into my arrhs; that I hoped the fright she had Sustained was the only material injury she would Suffer in conSe-quence of it; and concluded by observing (was that the cafe) I should conSider the accident of this morning as the most happy event of my life.
This diScourSe appeared to relieve her greatly, for in little more than a minute she, in a low, tremulous voice, replied:

all power to make any Sarther remark ;
the little poney, which this morning
ran away with me, I have occafionally

rode Sor more than two years, and he appeared to be free Srom every vice; indeed, to do justice to the little creature, I believe it was frightened, about half a mile from hence j I am Sure at least that 1 was, by the violent Swinging too of a gate, on which Some boys were unluckily playing : I now find mySelf much recovered from my fright.

Upon this, making her a reSpedtSul bow, I entreated her to do me the honour to take hold of my arm. With a Sweet blush that impurpled all her lovely Sace, she replied.

“ You have, though an entire stranger, Sir, obliged me too much, infinitely too much, Sor me to hesstate a moment upon putting mySelS under your protection and care, and indeed I do not think I can immediately proceed without assistance; and it would be prudery to the highest degree to reSuSe the Sarther ashstance oS the Gentleman

I now helped the lovely maid to riSe, which she did with tolerable eaSe, complaining only of a flight pain in her left ancle, which she Said she imagined was strained when she fell; the
refidence of my papa and mamma, if we paSs through the gate where my little horSe was first frightened, is no great distance; we shall, by going acrols three or four long meadows. Save a full
mile in the distance ; We accordingly proceeded forwards, and when we came to the gate as propoSed, we turned into the meadows, having given the Servant instrudlions how to proceed along the lane to the houSe. We continued to walk exceedingly flow, for it was very evident this lovely girl’s foot was not a little painful, when at length we came in Sight of a stately avenue of old

aSter the health oShis Lady and daugh-

ters, and had the SatisSadlion to learn they were perSedlly well. The Servant now brought chocolate, which having drank, Mr. Smith expressed himSelS nearly in the Sollowing words :
The connexion, Mr. Sommer-ville expresses a deSire to Sorm with my Samily, is oS that very interesting nature, and So much does our preSent,. as well as future, happineSs depend upon it, that too much consideration cannot be bestowed, on what must Sorm the baSis oS the mutual happineSs or miSery Sor liSe : Virtue and amiability of disposition, united with no little
delight in domestic concerns, constitute, in no Small degree, the leading features in the female charadier; theSe very material points should never be lost fight of by the man, who, capable

So made; nor is there, in my opinion,
a Ids attention to be paid to all the confiderations that constitute the Sclicity oS the married state by a woman of SenSe; for though mankind, from cuS* tom and perhaps from falSe ideas, indulge the men in liberties that would ruin, in the opinion of the world, the female charadler, I am notwithstanding inclined to think a virtuous, as well as a moral, charadter, absolutely neceS-Sary in the men to raiSe the strudure of their mutual happineSs upon. How miserable must it be for a woman of strid virtue and delicacy to find herSdf united, in the most folemn manner,, to a man of dissolute manners 1. Can hap-pineSs be expeded to ssowfrom a Source So contaminated ?. Certainly not. Mr. Sommerville, I have no doubt, will

pardon the observations I have made, as they are not the conSequence oS any inquiry I have made reipeDing himSelf^ but the interest I take in the general happineSs oS mankind : I have the heart-Selt SatisSadtion to Say every thing I have learned, reSpedling Mr. Som-merville, has proved, as I wish it may always do, much to his honour, and
consequently to his happineSs. ASter this remark I shall, Sor the preSent,
entertaining
only add, Mrs. Smith nearly the Same ideas with mySelS, looks upon Mr. Sommerville as a charafler deServing her relpedt, and Such as may
ultimately merit her affedlion.
My Lucy, Mr. Sominerville, has been brought up under the immediate care of her mother and mySelf; if nature has not dealt her favours with a Scanty hand, which you shall have the privilege of deciding upon, I trust

Independent in my fortune I never Suffered pecuniary considerations to have the least vreight with me, even for a moment 3 attractions, Such as are evidently conSpicuous in his lovely daughter, alone had charms for me, as they are qualities above all value. So they are the only consideration that could incite my mind, to Solicit the honour I had, to deServe which would constitute all my future happineSs: Wiihing Mr. Smith a good morning we now parted.

declaring she has never fince that evening been abSent Srom his mind. I hope my growing intimacy in the family will be the means of introducing him to that lovely and amiable girl.
Having Sat Some time, I returned home to dreSs for my engagement with the charming Lucy. This I did in a neat, not shewy, manner; when I again paid a vifit to Great Ormond-Street, the worthy Dodtor was returned, as were the Ladies, who, he Said, were just step’d up-stairs to adjust their hair. He now gave me the news-paper, while he read two or three letters that had been received in his abSence. In little more than a quarter of an hour the Servant gave notice the table was

The former received me with much Seeming pleaSure and reSpedt. The lovely Sisters blushing, drop’d me a courteSy, which I returned with a reSpedlful bow. We then moved forward to the table, when the
i
Doctor made me happy, by deSiring me to feat myfelf next the enchanting Lucy, which I did, bending my body fiightly as I fat down. Dinner over, and having drank two or three glasses of wine, the Dodtor faid, turning round to his daughters:

The dear girls, without any hesitation, expressed their readineSs to comply with the DoDor’s wish, and you may be well assured I expressed my Satisfadlion at the propoSal, and my readineSs to attend the Ladies. They immediately withdrew to prepare them-Sclves, and in leSs than ten minutes returned ; paying our reSpedts to the worthy Dodtor and his Lady, we took our leave for the preSent. This pro-

The very Savourable Sentiments entertained of Mr. Sommerville, by my honoured papa and mamma, cannot Sail to induce me to reSpedt him; and should my heart ever incline me to leave their protedling arms, I hope the man I give my hand to will not think it entirely undeServing his affedlion and regard ; it shall be then as much a

She now stopped, when I immediately replied, " IS to wish were to

I made the most Suitable return I could for this condefeenfion, when observing her lovely lister approaching, I pressed her lovely half-inverted lips to mine, which she delicately, though not

The way I came into the posteshon of the deeds in question was fimply this: My Sriend and client, Oliver Clench, ESq. oS the county oS Stafford, was applied to by Hawthorn for the Sum of four thoiifand pounds on his SuppoSed estates, fituated in and near Petton-Lodge, in the County of Salop. This my client readily agreed to do, provided the title deeds were Sent for the peruSal of his Solicitor. Hawthorn acquiefced, and Sent them in a box, agreeable to the diredlions he had received, to my chambers. Hawthorn,

through his hurry, not only Sent the deeds, but the mortgage for one thousand pounds, granted by the grandfather of Mr. Scott to his. Hawthorn’s father, who, ignorant of the conSe-quence,

Just as Mr. Heartfree had

finished this remark, the Servant intro-duced Mr. Hawthorn, having^ been So fortunate as to find him at the place where he was diredted by his master to go. Mr. Heartfree immediately addressed him in the following manner:
As travelling, Mr. Hawthorn, is not only troubleSome, but alfo very expenfive, I congratulate you upon your arriving in town So truly en point nomme. This Gentleman is grand-Son of the late Jonathan Scott, of Pet-

ton-Lodge, in the county of Salop. Here is a proper certificate to identify that he is the perfon he repreSents him-felf to be: This Gentleman is the Rev. Mr. Smith, Mr. Scott’s friend, (for I had previoussy announced myfelf) a charadter too reSpedlable to countenance imposture. The Surprife that took possession of Hawthorn is much better conceived than expressed; he stared at the lawyer, then ,at poor "James, and finished by meaSuring me from top to toe: At length he exclaimed: “ Zounds! can this be true ? Are you Sure, Mr. Lawyer, that the man is no cheat ? that he has not come to town to cozin me of my estate ? He looks like a sharp one.”

Why really, Hawthorn,” replied the Solicitor, you make me laugh j how the devil are you to be cozined out ofwhat you have no property in ?”
Say
THE ENGLISH MERCHANT. 237
" Say you So, Maister Black-gown, (Sor he was dressed in order to attend the Court) I will, for all your London tricks and quibbles, let you know that I have an honest title to all the estate, that you So honestly keep the writings of: Father [paid many a hard guinea for them, and I think I know how to keep it in the family."

Well, Hawthorn," replied Mr. Heartfree, I will give you full credit for your very honest intention; but if you can continue the faid estates any longer in the Hawthorn family, I will refign my pradtice, and give you the gown off my back as a gratuity or in-trodudory fee. Pray did you never hear your father fay the estates in queS-tion were only limply mortgaged, and have you never Seen Such mortgage ?" The fellow looked planet struck.
« Well,
238 THE ENGLISH MERCHANT.

Well
much obliged to you Sor your goodwill, but lie have none oS your mortgage; what, though you have the deeds, ISe got the deed oS Sale, which was given to father when he bought that estate.”

‘‘ Then you are a d—d lucky Sel-low iS you have, and I would advile you to return hom.e and bring the Same to town with you, as I have what will completely do your buSineSs (pulling a deed out oS his pocket) provided you should Sail to find this Same deed of Sale.”—This struck the honest Sarmer all of a heap j he could Scarce believe his eyes, though he was no stranger to the circumstance, till he Saw, upon a narrow flip oS paper, that bound it round. Some remarks in his own handwriting, “ Why, what devil has played

Gonfidering the climate he has So many years refided in, and his advance in liSe, he appears to enjoy more health and Spirits than could reasonably be expedted. He appeared greatly disappointed when I informed him where you was; but Soon reconciled it when he learned the benefit you had received from Sea-bathing, and the better and more fully to Satisfy him of your purSuits and deSires, stepping to my deSk, I gave him your last letter to me to peruSe.

I had, my dear friend, to own the truth, particular and private views of my own to gratiSy, that this fatal attachment will utterly destroy. I have been too inconfiderate in my meaSures. When Harry leSt the East, I gave him a Small packet, not to be opened upon any consideration till aSter my arrival, or till my deceaSe, should that first have happened.

My Sormer acquainted you with the Sooting Mr. Van Helmont

had in our family, and the great reSped and regard my honoured parents entertained Sor that Gentleman. Some Sew days fince he received a letter Srom a particular Sriend of his father’s, accompanied with a line or two in his father’s own hand-writing; the former to announce his arrival in England, the latter to remove his apprehenfions for his health, indicating his intention (instead of Sending for him to town) to pay a viSit to Scarborough. TheSe letters were brought him by his Servant one day just after dinner. Begging my parent’s permission, and making me a refpedful bow, he broke the Seal.
The contents appearing to affed him highly, my papa expressed his hope, his emotion did not ariSe from any unpleaSant information contained in what he read :—No, my dear Sir,’* he replied, in accents half broken,
‘‘ it is a contrary SenSation that affeds

The compliment his affeclion pays to his Son, So Soon after his landing, is expressive of that regard he hath from my childhood honoured me with.”

This diScourfe of Mr. Van Hel-mont’s Surprised my honoured parents

After congratulating him on the Safe arrival of his father, and the proSpedl: there was of his So Soon embracing him, my papa Said to Mr. Van Helmont, “ As I am much better acquainted than yourSelf with the accommodation the different inns in this neighbourhood afford, I will attend you to the town in order to Secure the most convenient.” He thanked him very politely for his attention to him, when, after taking a Second glafs of wine, and wishing the Ladies a pleaSant afternoon, they Set off together to complete their intention. This they did much to their Satisfadlion, having provided two very neat roomy chambers on the fame floor, and a Spacious parlour, with rooms on the
attic for the Servants.

which.
This being all

which, together with the liveries, had been previoussy deScribed, they returned back again. The morning passed over with its uSual cheerSulneSs, Save that Some few times my papa appeared more than uSually thoughtSul, and was more particular in his inquiries relpedling Mr. Van Helmont’s Sather, than he beSore had ever been. From this day Mr. Van Helmont went constantly every morning and every aSternoon to the inn to make his inquiry, and always directed his Servant to keep pretty much in that quarter of the town, to obierve what carriages might arrive, that he might not loSe a minute in throwing himSelS at the Seet of his father for his goodneSs to him. Three days passed over, when young Mr. Van Helmont began to be uneaSy at the absence of his father. The time being expired he had allowed himSelf to arrive
in, when on the fourth morning, just
as

as he had gained the Summit oS the hill that commands the town, he observed the Servant that attended him on full Speed towards him: He naturally concluded what occafioned his diSpatch. They Soon met, when the Servant announced the arrival of his master’s carriage. A few minutes carried Mr, Van Helmont into the inn vard, when instantly dismounting, he stew into the apartments that had been engaged for their reception, and Sprang into his father's arms, who observing his approach through a fide window that

count. This naturally led to the pur-poSe of their journey : Mr. Van Hel-mont, Sen. was then made acquainted with every thing reSpedling Mr. Hartley, his Lady, and daughter, that his Son considered as necessary, declaring, at the Same time, that he Solicited his father’s Sandipn, it gave him inexpreS-fible concern to find (from an allufion in Mr, Manley’s letter) that he had formed in his own mind a different
connexion.
His father acknowledged
he had for Some years entertained a defire to compleat a certain wish, very dear to him ;• but then it was dependant upon circumstances, not entirely within his immediate reach, or even power to affedt j that on that account, joined to his wish to render him happy as it was possible to make him; he had troubled his worthy friend, Mr. Man-ley, to accompany him So far j that #hey wGuld take one day’s rest from

He now, for a Second time, embraced his Son, who had diffolved in tears at this fresh instance of his father’s affedtion and regard. After having drank chocolate, my Harry propoSed the fending the Servant to my father’s, to acquaint him with the reaSon that detained him, and his intention to have the honour of drinking tea with us in the afternoon. This was immediately acceded to by both Gentlemen ; my parents shared in my lover’s happineSs, nor was my mind a little affedted on the occafipn. At tlie appointed time Mr. Van Helmont
came,, and delivered the reshedlful

compliments of his father, concluding
with

with his intention to ride over in the morning, which I thought appeared to afford my parents the highest Satis-fadlion. Harry had engaged to return before dush, in order to Spend the evening with his father and Mr. Man-ley. We Ipent an hour aSter tea very agreeably, chiefly in diScourfing upon the happy arrival of Mr. Van Hel-mont from abroad, and his Solicitude for his Son’s happineSs, in coming So far immediately after his landing. This topic engaged us So inSenfibly, that my lover, looking at his watch, declared he had over-staid his time ; but observed he had two pleas to offer in exciiSe—the charms of his mistreSs, and the agreeable conversation and company of her parents; but that now he should return to his father, and that truly reSpedable friend, Mr. Manle}^ who had So kindly attended him. Saying this, he took his leave. He
had

My dear mother stew to his affistance; I trembled every limb, though unconScious of the cauSe of my dear father’s distreSs. I poured immediately out a glaSs of Ip ring water, and carried it to him, which he drank, and appeared much better*
He now Said to my dear mother:
" I Scarce know why, my dear j but the last words of Mr. Van Helmont affe<9:s me greatly. With his father’s name he added that of a Gentleman (if the fame he means) who once was my most reSpedled friend. I know too much, to know no more j therefore,

The Servant now bringing his horle, after affedlionately embracing my mother and mySelS, he took his leave. My dear mother was unable to account for the state of my father’s mindi tho’ she knew he must be greatly interested, whatever were the motives that induced it. My dear mother had just rung and ordered candles, for we had been muling upon this fubjedt, and enjoying the Solemn stillneSs of the evening, by the pale glare of the fire. The Servant bringing candles, placed them on
the Side-board, in order to keep them farther from the air, while he shut the windows to, which he was in the a(5l

This circumstance Surprised us both no little; when preSently a carriage and four horSes drove into the yard, attended by tv/o Servants, the one leading my papa’s horSe. — This increased the SurpriSc that now began to Seize my dear mother very powerfully. She fievr into the adjoining room, the better to wait the event, and to compoSe herSelf. I immediately followed her, when I heard my dear father embracing the strangers, and welcoming them to his houSe. He then inquired for my mother, and being told where she was, he stew to her, and catching her fondly in his arms, exclaimed :

prosperity and happineSs of my country.”
Supper now was introduced, whicli put a period, for tKe preSent, to all further conversation. The fatigue the travellers had undergone, together with the agitation of fpirits, all the parties had more or Id's Sustained, made it neceSfary to retire early to rest; taking an affedtionate leave each of the other»
we Separated for the night.
In the
morning all parties appeared much refreshed and compoSed; What had happened at Elm-Houfe Soon found its way to the ParSonage j we received tfie congratulations of the worthy Doctor,

tor, his excellent Lady, and truly amiable daughters,with thoSe oS Mr. Som-merville, and his Sriend Sir George Bingley, who had accompanied that Samily into the country, at the particular requcSt oSMr. Sommerville, made to Mr. Smith. This was the eaSier obtained, as his uncle, Lord Villers, had been Mr, Smith’s very kind Shend wliile at College; So that I entertain very little doubt that the lovely Polly will shortly be as happy, as So much beauty, good SenSe, an excellence oS diSpofi-tion eminently merits. This day was chiefly taken up byMr.WilSon’s relating to my honoured parents what steps he took aSter quitting England. His first' Lady’s uncle was a rich biirgo-master at Amsterdam; tohim, taking his infant Son with him, he instantly repaired, and-received a very affedtionate reception,, attended withSome fewstridlure-supoi; the fatal tendency oSadventuring too deeply

in Such peculations. TheSe observations, my uncle could not but admit, the conSequences So immediately present to his view; the and influence that Mynheer Van Graaffe had with the leading powers at home, were employed to Secure to my unci a Seat in the precedency at Batavia, which was almost immediately effedled, and every proper meaSure taken Sor his establishment. The ScaSon Sor the Company’s ships Sailing arriving, he embarked, and reached, without
\
any material incident the place oS his destination, and, aSter producing the necessary vouchers, was admitted to the rank appointed him-. Some few years after, the Chief of the Council dying, he married the widow, whofe fortune exceeded eighty thouSand pounds. She stirvived her former hushand only three years, when, by the
deceafe of Some, and the return of

Others, his Seniors, he acquired the prc-fidential chair, which he had enjoyed Sull ten years previous to his quitting
it on his retiring; that the whole cS

his Sortune, in the English and Dutch Sunds, exceeded three hundred thousand pounds and, though I never can,” he Said, while riSing from his
Suf-
Seat to embrace his brother, ‘ ficiently atone for the injury and distreSs 1 have occaSioned, you must permit me the heart-Selt Satisfadion to divide that Sum in equal moities between your Self and me.”
This instance of my uncle’s honour and affeflion for my father, very Senfi-bly affe<5led every perSon prefent.
My dear father roSe, and pressed him to his boSom, faying, — That this moment of his fraternal regard, amply compensated Sor all the distreSs his former mistakes had occasioned.”

My uncle now continued The only objedtion I had to my Harry’s engagement with MiSs Hartley, was,, that it coimteradled my plan with re-Spedl to my niece: I ever flattered mySelf that I should one day live to return, and repair, by their union (at least as Sar as I could) that ruin I had brought upon the kindest of brothers.. I little thought that his lovely Caroline-was the identical charmer it was my intention to diScover. I mean to pur-chaSeaSeatin Some healthy county, and to give my lovely niece fifty thouSand pounds, to preSent a moiety of it as her dower to my Harry, on her wedding day ; the other moiety to be fettled on herSelf in trust for her own Separate uSe; mySelf allowing Harry, from the reSidue of my fortune, two thouSand pounds per annum; leaving to my dear brother and Sister the free exerciSe of their pleaSure with reSpedt

This noble but becoming condudl oS my uncle’s leSt not a dry eye in the room. My dear mother tenderly embraced him, and declared his generous conduct should bury all her Sorrows in oblivion.
My uncle now roSe, and approached my Seat, when, taking my hand, he led me towards my dear mother. Saying,.
It remains with you, my ever kind Sister, to compleat my wishes, respecting my lovely niece; let Some day in the enSuing Vv^eek unite my lovely niece with my Harry, and let him now receive her hand, as a preSage oS his Suture bliSs.”
My mother, in compliance with the wish of my uncle, roSe Srom her Seat,

My dear father now embraced us in. a very affedlionate manner,; when Mr. Manley begged to be permitted to share im the general joy of my family. He approached me with Such evident reSpedt and regard, that I was Senfibly affected by it„ when Saluting me, he Said : —“ Suffer me, amiable young Lady, to join my congratulations, and very fincere wishes to thoSe of your truly rcSpedable family 3 to their worth

My dear mother, calling me her excellent Caroline^ returned into the parlour.
