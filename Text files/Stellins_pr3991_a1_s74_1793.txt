TO
The EDITOR.
(
Rome, Dec. 8, 1790.
I Send you a manuScript, which Mr. G. G. our common friend com-mishoned me to put into your hands on his departure from London.—It is his wish that it should be published in France, and under your inSpedtion.

And now I have fulfilled my com-miffion, let me add a Sew particulars in explanation of the work. Mr. G. G. compiled the letters after his return from the Istand of Sicily.—When
4
r
he had completed the tour of that fine country, and was preparing to return to Rome, chance introduced him to the acquaintance of a young man of • the city of Palermo, with whom he quickly contradted a most tender and lasting friendship.-—This circumstance
r»
detained him there, and it was not still after his friend’s departure from Palermo, in purSuit of a woman he adored, and who was going to England, that he himSelf went from thence and rejoined me at Rome.— He left me Soon after, in Spite of my
entreaties,
*
C ]
, entreaties, and retired to an agreeable Solitude at Tivoli.
It was in this retreat that he Secretly traced the fatal progreSs of the paffion that led astray his abSent friend.—He rarely came to Rome — Unhappy from Suffering friendship, the vivacity of his diSposttioii left him, and he entirely abandoned his accustomed purSuits and occupations. He mourned the fate of a youth who was possessed of stronger feelings than the generality of mankind, torn away from him by a dangerous and fatal attachment,—^^engaged in the pursuit of a woman, the wife of a rich and powerful man, and in a country, Too, where the manners of its inhabitants
i
»
[ Vi. ]
bitants are leSs corrupted than in the rest oS Europe; and where the laws incessantly watch over the honor oS every one;—where the weak are protected and the injured redressed.-— He contemplated with dread the abySs which the ssightest attempt to violate theSe laws might open to the unwary Sootsteps of his Sriend; and Secretly regretted that he had nothing but vain and unavailing counSels to offer him. He anticipated the > Satal conSequence oS his purSuits, and aSter the melancholy catastrophe had happened, he took upon himSelS the mournSul talk oSstrewing Some flowers upon his friend’s grave, by thus collecting all his letters and forming them into an exaCt Series of events.
Such
/
[ vii. ]
Such has been the motive of this publication, and Surely a more ate feding motive can Scarcely be conceived.
\
' But tho’, like Achilles, he wished to eternize his Sorrow, yet he preServed
r
all that reSpect which was due to the memory of his friend, and concealed his name under that of the title of the work, and his own under that of Fabius. Yet in Spite of theSe precautions, there are few people in this part of the world, but who, upon the peruSal of the book will eafily recognize the name and the unhappy end of the young Palerinian.
T
%
[ viii. ]
I, mySelf, knew this young man, and have oSten heard him Speak of the acquaintance he had made at Palermo with the English lady in question, and not at Vemce, as appears by the letters. The compiler has probably thus changed the Scene of their first interview, the better to Savour the mystery in which he wifired to envelope the name and story of his friend.

OUR advice, my Sriend, is that oS a Sage,—but before it can prove of ' any Service to your unhappy Stellins, you should do away the enormous disparity that Subfists between a man that Seels keenly, and one who judges coolly.
Were you to Seel Sor a day,—for an hour,—Sor an instant, the thousandth part oS that torment which has

I have experienced a change in my . fate, however, fince I last wrote to you,—but whether for the better or the worSe time alone can shew me.—
Why have we not the Saculty of penetrating into the immutable decrees of destiny?—a Single word would then put an end to my Sufferings, and that word would be^—hope !
I have Seen her at the opera, in public, at an affembly,—and file was every where enchanting,—and every where impreffed me with SenSations of

Yesterday I strolled out oS the city, being diSgusted with its noiSe, and I had no intention oS returning beSore the evening.—I walked towards Hyde Park,-—Lady Petershy’s hotel is in

I Saw her carriage at the door as I pasted by her houfe; it was but eight o’clock in the morning, and she could not be engaged in paying vi-stts at So early an hour.—Being at a , loSs to conceive what this could mean I turned into Hyde-Park, and relinquished my Sormer intention oS going Sarther, and I did well to change my plan.
This park is one oS the most agreeable walks I ever Saw.—It lies at the western extremity oS the city, and is a place of very conssderable extent; equally commodius Sor carriages as for people on Soot, and is a place of Sash-ionabl e reSort.

After walking about Sor Some time I came near a fine garden. Separated Srom the park by a ditch and parapet wall—
1 at length came to a Small door, which I found half open; a poor man stood near it, and Seemed to be begging alms. I gave him a piece of money— and from him I learnt that the place the door led into was called Kenfington Gardens, and that the public were allowed to walk there.—I received a thouSand benedidions Srom the beggar, and was much astonished at the grateSul acknowledgements he expressed for Such a trifle.—It was with Secret pain that I constdered the Surprise that a poor man Selt at having touched the compaffion of a rich one; —and from this incident I began to
conceive

96	ST EL LINS.
conceive rather an unSavourable idea oS the nation.
Absorbed in refiedions arissng Srom the Subjedl beSore me, I inSenSibly strolled into one of the most retired walks oS the garden;—it was compoSed of lofty trees and beautiful underwood, and afforded a Scene highly congenial with my penssve turn of mind.—As I was coming back towards the place where I had entered, I perceived a glove on the ground; I took it up, and looked around to See if I could find out to whom it belonged,—and I Saw a lady coming towards the Spot, and looking about as if she had dropped Something. I walked up to her, and accosting her, preSented the glove.

She could not conceal her feelings-*-nor hide her blushes as she looked at me, and listened with great condeScenston to the paffionate words I was uttering, which my love didlated, but which my faultering lips could hardly pronounce.—^What did I Say to her? indeed I know not!—Sor Surely I cannot now recolledS, what I knew So little about even while I was Saying it.

On our return to the castle, he related this adventure, — and North, both with a view to pay his court to my Lord, and to avail himSelf oS So fine an occafion oSlaughing at my expence, complimented me on the beauty oS the adlion, which he Sarcastically Said was perfeflly humane.

I am then Sar Srom being inclined to a<st like the Englishman, who, though reSolved to hasten his end, lost a world of time in compostng a large volume, in which he endeavoured to prove that his adlion was equally excuSable in the eyes of God and man. —- What was the con-Sequence ?—Proud of his arguments, which he had gathered Srom the best authors oS antiquity who have written in Savour of Suicide, a Secret impulSe of vanity, made him wish to See the effedt they would produce upon the
minds of his readers. He confined
*
himSelf for Some days, and finding
f
that nobody thought of perSuading him to give up his fatal reSolution, he contented himSelf with aecufing
mankind

mankind oS inSenssbility, without finding Sortitude enough in his heart, to execute what he had So ably de-
I
Sended.
\
No, Fabius, I will not a£t thus!—

Why, what care I Sor their cold disapprobation?—Did they create me? —Do I owe an account oS my liSe to them ? — What authority have they over me?—The existence I detest is not a giSt of their’s; what right then have they to diSpoSe of a property to which they have no claim, against my will?—When it becomes hateful to me, when I no longer find any pleasure in it, when I am ready in a word to reproach my only master with the baneful preSent he has made me,^—
then,,
S T E L L I N S.	l6l
then, my Sriend, then will I Say to mySelS, God could not create you Sor your own misSortune; you can-not offend him in endeavouring to avoid it. There is one truth which no reasoning can destroy, and that is, that we are Sree to leave a place where we are ill at our eaSe, — go out then, the door is open to youV
And what great harm shall I do to Society in depriving it of So uSeleSs and inadive a member —I shall, you Say, fill the hearts of my family and friends with grief and shame. Shame!—why, Fabius, I shall, be ashamed to call you my friend! — Tell me what will become of your grief .J*-r-«Wlio will have dried up your

tears, when So cruel a Sentiment shall have effaced Srom your brow, the Sacred impreffion stamped on it by
your regret?—O, best of Sriends!—
/
no, you will not blush for me; you will not pronounce my name without a tear; but your tears will be as pure and gentle as your mind, and Sree -Srom the bitterneSs oS shame. No, my Sriend, never shall my memory
awaken Sentiments of hatred and con-
. *
tempt. You will often vistt the place where my body will repoSe, as impassable as the stone that covers it, but not equally inSenfible to the tears you will shed there.—No, my Soul will dart towards you, will See, and Speak to you from the bottom of its narrow and gloomy abode; and while

I cannot refist the Inclination I feel to quote a refleftion of M. de Sainte-Foix, nearly on the fame	^
Subject. I think,” fays he, that love alone wouhl fuflice to establish the idea of the immortality of the foul among the most favage nations. I loved 5 -—I was beloved !—-Death has robbed me of the object that was fo dear to me!—No, I cannot: perfuade myfelf that I Sliall never fee h^r more !”
