Harriet appears	Such a	vacuum.
I was lafl night at Carlille-hoiiSe,.. where my brother, to oblige whom I went thither, introduced	me	to	Lady Anne
Clifibrd, who is lately arrived from Italy with her aunt Lady Harman.——^This young lady valuer herSelf prodigiouily upon a large fortune, which has devolved to her in confequence of the death of a brother and filler, and I believe Charles values her upon the fame account. Should an alliance take place between the two families, the one fond of riches and the
r \	**
other of honours,	I	tremble for	what may
be the event in fome future day.
You will expeO; polfibly to hear my opinion of the entertainments of the place—Tired to death with impertinence from apes of quality, and affronted by borrowed witticifms from females who have funk themfelves below their fex, and are yet permitted with thofe who rank themfelves with the highefi; of mortals. It is impoffible to defcribe the fatigues of the evening. Surfeited with flattery from Mifs Clifford, I returned diftraded with the head-ach. This
deemed pleafure by fome ; one hour of your company
but.

Harriet’s opinion, is worth an age of Such trifling. Mrs. Vareny kindly called on me this morning. Her friendly fo-' ciety alone could have reftored ray complacency, abSent as I was from my Lucy, and fick of polite persecution. This gene-' rous lady came to Solicit a benefaction from my mother for a dhlrefled widovr: and you may be Sure, Such an example being Set, her ladyfhip could not well with-hold her benevolence—and Mrs.' Vareny Succeeded. Can an hundred maSquerades convey So much real Satisfaction to the heart, as oneNnch humane
action ?

: The lafl: packet brought us a letter from Lord Mulcefter. He makes ho-nourable mention of you: indeed George elteems you much; he always calls you fiflier; and it is a moot point with me whether he loves Harriet or Lucy bell;
I mean, in the fifterly way: for his disappointment in his firfl: love (which MiSs^ GrandiSon callsfirji nonfenfe') hangs heavy on his heart, good youth ! Allow for a Sifter’s partiality, Harriet! he is almoft a Second Sir Charles, even as Mr. Richard-- fon has drawn him, only approaching a little nearer to human nature.

J am fure your father and mother would not Sacrifice their only daughter.: but your too great ■'fenfibility, my love,' caufes you to magnify olyetSts. Learn^ my Lucy, to guard your lips, to guard your pen : your parents. Superior knowledge of the world (and perhaps, in their exalted flat ion, proper ufe of riches) may plead as m'uch in their behalf, as your delicacy of fe“ntiment on yours. Mrs. Vareny, whom*.you profeSs to admire, ought to be .your pattern. Would that amiable woman, think you, let an unguarded word eScape her lips or pen on conjecture only i* She is indeed an example. With what a painful pleasure have I beheld her ! becaufe I have traced all my dear departed mother in every look, in every adion, how often have I wifhed to be one of her houfehoid! What an exemplary hufband is Mr. Vareny! There is not a virtue in human nature, of which ke is not endowed with a portion.—Such

If i have the lealf encouragement, I will write my Self; if I gain my point, I will, with my father’s permiffion, come to town to accornpany her down hither.
My brother arrived on TueSday* night, with three companions of his own claSs; Mr. Melmoth is one of them:' I have heard you mention him ; he is a favourite* wuth my father and Peregrine.

you have been very naughty.—But, to quit that fubjetft for one more entertain-1 muft tell you, I have even in this (what a lady of the, bon ton would call dreary) Solitude, met with an adventure. Hiding out for an airing the other morn-attended only by Thomas, I let my IiorSe take his courfe ; when after three
ing.
he
brought me to a
hours gentle pace, pleaSant village, where on the verge of a common, 1 found a decent cottage, or rather box, adorned with an air of Simple elegance. In the little court before the door all the hardy winter exotics were placed In painted vaSes; the window-curtains, I perceived, were crimSon da-maSk; and a giiittar was hanging in one of the rooms. Struck whth Such an uncommon appearance in an obfcure village, I wished to fee and know farther: I therefore ordered Thomas to beg a glaSs of water for me. A very decent old woman came to the door, and defired to know “ if madam would alight, and

I H A V E not Succeeded, Lucy, in my attempt to find out the fair incognita. I have Seen her, it is true ; but it was only a tranSient view. The firft opportunity that offered I renewed my vifit to her retreat. When 1 arrived, I found her playing on her guittar, accompanying it with a voice So melodious, that I was for a few moments lofl in admiration. But 1 ought firft to have told you, I left Thomas and tliQ horSes at a diftance, and consequently was not perceived by her at my entrance. My good old hoftefs received me very cordially, but told me “ She believed madam would be difplealed ‘‘ to fee a ftranger.” Contrary, however, to my uSual timidity, the lady’s maid coming down, ftairs, I Sent my reSpecfts to her miftreSs, and begged (if my requeft were not too improper) to be admitted to Speak with her. She immediately came down, and condu(fted me to her drefling room. I then apologized for the in-
trufiouj
(	14 )
truSion, and told her my motives for it. She thanked me for mv kind intention;
mi
in her favour, faying that. She was SenSible of the honour I did her ; but, honourable and advantageous as. my notice would; be to her. She w'as So delicately circum-Itanced, that flie mull decline what otherwise would be the firft wifh of her heart* It is Scarcely poffible to deScribe the Sweet-neSs of her manner, whilft addreffing me:, but when She. had done Speaking, fhe turned, to the window, and put her handkerchief to her eyes—fine eyes indeed fhe has, but a kind of a wildneSs in them that Seems to indicate a disordered mind— perhaps that is the cafe,, and this romantic retreat is the effedt of her raiSed imai-gination. 1 took, my leave, plea fed, but not Satisfied : to intrude farther would be indeed to gratify my own curioSity (which is perhaps impertinent) at the expence of another’s peace. Adieu, happy village ! Said I; adieu, unhappy fair 1 (for. Such I doubt fire is). And thus, I (up-poSe, will end the SubjeO: of the village
belle.
My brother, and his companions are with US; and now I muff tell you Something to their honour. A cottage in the vicinity of RoSe Mount being lately by, accident reduced to allies, a poor man, his wife, and four children were totally

MUST tell you, Harriet,! do not like your belie de village So well as you do. What Sort of eyes She may have, I cannot Say; but I am Sure they cannot be discerning ones, or She would not have, declined an acquaintance with one that muft have been in any Situation So infinitely pleafmg. Little did She know the honour that awaited her.—Nor do I think there is any good going forward where there is So mucli myftery; although I

You are a wonderful girl, Harriet. Orpheus made the brutes and trees move but you have the power to add weight to feathers, and flop the whirligig motion in your preSence. Yet,, with all your good qualities, you are for once blarne-able: you have found fault with Lucy in the wrong place; for when I inform you an offer was made to me of Lord B. for a hulband, ffrongly enforced by my mother, and feconded by my father, will you not own I have reaSon to complain ? Could you have thought it ? I have fuSpeO;ed it for Some time, which occa-fioned the hints I before gave you:, and yet I could Scarcely believe ray earsy

when her kd^'fhip informed me Lord B. had afked leave of my father to addreSs me, and that conSent was given; and his iordfhip was to be introduced in form the following afternoon. Let me die, if 1 would not Sooner marry one of the Cyclops, if Such a being exifted. When I exprefled my deteftation and aftonilh-ment at fuch condudt, ‘‘ Nay, Lucy, “ (Said my mother) only hear him ; his Iordfhip has feep, and repented of his “ former errors ; and belides, he is in “ great favour with the higher powers.’* Ah! there, Harriet, thereOies the te.up-tation..

And now I will tell yoir, Harriet, how I received him. His Scandalous Iordfhip^ came to dinner, which I did not expedt, otherwise 1 would have been indiSpofed: but I was unprepared •, however, I put the belt face that I could upon the matter (as, according, to the warrior’s phraSe, they had Itolen a march on me) ; andp as it was, his right-honourablelhip had
but:
(	19 )
but little comfort of my company : all I could Sing or Say was in praife of Mr. Hill, who, in imitation, of his late mailer, chuSes to exalt him Self to the hill-top, as a burning and a Shining light j a Subjedl, you may be Sure, etnaflly caU culated to his lordShip’s talle he Hared as if he had been at Oraheite, and Sneered like the beaux deScribed by the great latirill:
“ In vain

U
her hearer had no Share
In all fhe Said—except to Hare.
His judgment was, upon the whole,. This lady is the dulleH foul—
She may be handSome, young and rich; But none will burn her for a witch.”
Am I not excellent at quotations, Harriet What would you- have done in Such a caSe Why, perhaps, you would have fat down and cried, whimpered, and Said, “ Pttty, Sir ! indeed I cannot “ comply.^’ Ha !, ha ! I cannot help laughing to think how his expeding lord-Hiip looked.—All algebra to him, girl I I laugh, and yet I am vexed: but 1 warrant he never ambles here again on Such an errand.
As

As Soon as the cloth was removed,. I withdrew, under pretence to attend MiSs D. to the Lock chapel. When I returned, all mouths were opened on me at once, except my father’s. “ Lucy !’’ exclaimed my mother ; “ Lucy 1” Said uncle John ; “ Sifter Lucy !” Said Charles; “ What muft Lord B. think of you he will

Lady Lucy Temple to MifsViLLARs.
w R 1 T E
w ithout
again, my for
dear Harriet,
waiting tor your anSwer, to acquaint you that Lord Mulcelter is ex-pe(hed in England next month, and So improved that he will appear a perfedl blazing ffar. Guard your inSenSible heart (inSenfible, I mean, as to love) left Cupid, prince of gods and men, Ihould do your bufinefs for you: but Lady Mulcefter you fhallbe i therefore
CC
Repair your fmiles, awaken ev*ry grace. And call forth all the wonders of your

face.”
Forgive this levity, Harriet ; I am reduced to the necelhty of either crying or
and therefore I think the latter
moft eligible. You know I dreaded ray vifit to Mifs Clifford : Sure never poor lafs Suffered fuch an evening as I have done I Moft elegantly was 1 drefled ;— (wficn am I otherwise? you will fay)—
Charles
( 27 )
Charles was, in the true fenfe of the word, as fine as A Lord. Mils Clifford had Scraped all her relations together from the fourth generation to welcome her intended fpouSe and Sifter-in-law ; and they were So be-drelTed, and So be-dizened, and did So Itare at my brilliant lady Ship, who flaunted away in jonquil and Silver, and a moft elegant Suit of Brulfels point, juft arrived from Lord Mulcefter, that I was, to be Sure, rather a figure to be envied : (No vanity at all in me, Harriet !) Two or three old grimalkins of quality next made their appearance.; and the card-tables were juft Set, when Lord B. was announced. He came in with an air So degage, and yet So little of a fop, and paid his compliments with Such a manly grace, that in Spite of my averlion to his moral cjharadler, I could not See him with that deteftation which every honeft girl ought to have for a libertine. He Soon Singled me out; hoped I was entertained at the Lock; he intended to have a feat there himSelf, as he found it was the tafte. (Only think, Harriet, the tafte to go to church!) It puts me in mind of Dean Swift’s adviSmg the Duke of Wharton to take the frolic of being good. And So we are to change our mode in worfijip
C Z	9lS
C ^8 )
as v/e do our caps\ and this in the reign oS a pious Prince and his amiable conSort, who endeavour to Set the bell example.
When this diScourSe was ended, Lord B. with a delicacy I did not think him capable of, made me an offer of his fine per-fon: I refufed him ; but with more goodnature than I think he deferved, all things confidered. He had the affurance to tell me, he Should not yet defpair, if by his future conduct he could gain my efleem. (A modeft hope, you will fay.) He looked with very fignificant eyes at Charles and MiSs Clifford : fine advocates he will have in them. An excellent creature is this fame Anne Clifford. I will give you an inflance of her humanity: Lord B. was invited by Charles to a morning party ; he excufed himSelf by faying (and I believe with truth) he was engaged to attend at the Levee in behalf of an unfortunate youth who lay under fentence of death, whofe aged mother had been his petitioner. “ Could I, fays he, refufe ?”
----Pfliaw ! hang the man, faid MiSs
“ Clifford i it will eafe the mother of a “torment, and he will only die a little “ while before in the common courfe of “ things it would happen.”*—My look of indignation would have petrified a
woman
( 29 )
Woman of fenSibility. Lord B. bit his lip; and Charles blufhed disapprobation. Such a glaring inftance of the depravity of human nature could not eScape any one : but, after a few moments, the cards and filhes went to work as before. His Lordfhip took his leave to purSue the good work before-mentioned.
From the account I have now given, you will perceive the Devil is not fa black as he is painted, have done this juftice to one philanthropic virtue in the man, yet your Lucy's heart will remain untouched by fuch exterior qualities. However, when I retired, I could not help thinking of the Sweet

I APPROVE of your Scheme, Jack,
in all its branches; I have heard of Harriet Viilars; and by all accounts She is a nonpareil. As to a wife,: why, it is a mere nominal affair in thefe days. A man' has no more to' do with a wife than he has with a cbnveyance : the lawyers are the principals i, you have only to fign and Seal,, and ^i^eive the money.- Your honour iwill be Safe with Such a girl as MiSs Velars; and that is all you need to care fbr. You may purSue your Schemes of pleaSure as uSual ; leave your meek, dutiful confort to mind her bantams and

bee-hivesand when, you are* tired of. variety, except the name of wife makes her charms pall, you may enjoy a month, agreeably enough at Eaftmain'or Rofe Mount with the pious ideot, who will; think it her duty to receive you with
complacence, and to make all things as
comfortable as polTible.

I have Seen Lord Eaftniain: he chuckled with joy to think you approved his fcheme: for I read your letter to him, if it may be called reading it to reverSe every line, and make you a mere moral fellow, and defperately in love with the fair Harriet. I thought his gouty lord-Ihip would have danced with his crutches.
Now this is as it Ihould jbe,. (cried he); ‘‘ what he Said to me I did not mind ;
but he certainly has wrote his fenti-‘‘ ments to you, who are hjs friend.”—■ Yes, old Square-toes, thought I, he certainly has, but not fit for your eye, till "Eaftmain eftate is fettled.
As to your beautiful bunter Ifabella, 1 can by no means find out her retreat j but patience and perSeverance will do all things. 1 hope fbe is abroad, and will flay there till you are fhackled *, and then file may come if fbe pleaSes: for girls bred in MiSs Villars’s manner will think it their duty to nurSe both your miftreSs and her baftards, if fbe Should chance to have any. And this is the comfort of thofe (nonfenSical) virtuous women, as they chooSe to call themfelves.—Your perSon, and your Specious manner, when you pleaSe, may perhaps attract the girl, if that Spirited little devil Lucy Temple
(who
( S5 >
(who mull have heard of So many
your frolics) does not caution heragainfl
you. You know the friendfhip that fub-^
fills between them, and to what romantic
lengths girls carry their friendlhips, efpe cially. if oppoSed; and that old Villars may do, if Lucy Should tamper with Harriet; therefore Secure Lady Lucy^
and all is Safe. Lord B. is addreffing^
this delicate termagant; if he Succeeds in
his Suit, then Surely you may in yours. Charles Temple is already married (in the news-papers) to MiSs Clifford:; but 1 fancy the match is really in great forwardness. Thus will a hundred and;

Lord Mulcester to Lady L. Temple

December 14, 17
My dear Lucy,
Y
OUR brother, the friend of your heart, (a name more (acred than that included in the fraternal tie) congratulates you on your rejedtion of Lord B, He knew Lucy would not be caught by outward form never once was he de-
ceived in his filler.
mull I
—What can I, what fay of my honoured parents on this occafion? Cullom alone can be pleaded in their behalf: they depend on the merits of their daughter, and tliink it is in her power to reclaim, and bring back to the path of morality, one over whom they may preSume Ihe might have So much influence. So think the fond parents—But a depraved mind cannot feel, cannot talle, half Lucy’s virtues. May
not
( 45 )
not my filter, in endeavouring to purify^ —I had almoft Said—be contaminated f We live in an age that looks lightly over what I call not Jmall crimes.^ although 'the hon ton may deem them Such.—Yet I may trull 3'Our principles are too well fixed to be lhaken : but vice, by" being feen, does not fhock So much as when She firll fhews her ugly viSage. I do not mean any particular refledlion on Lord B. He is certainly blelTed with good fenSe and good nature, and has many to keep him in countenance even in his groISeft faults ; but a man of fuch a call cannot be a fuitable hulband for Lucy Temple.
It has been hinted to me, Lucy, that my dear and honoured father is propoSed
as ambalTador to V-------. Sure he will
not except Such an arduous talk. Why fiiould he fatigue himfelf with Hate alffairs, when there are fo many younger perfons, whoSe perfedl health and ftrength of faculties render them more fit for fuch an office ? Did it become me to remonllrate on the occafion, I would, with all fub-miffion, advife his Lordfiiip to decline an honour, that I am afraid would, if accepted, in fuch a climate prejudice his conllitution. My uncle Stanly and Charles, I doubt, have been the Tecret projedlors
of
( 46 )
of this Scheme. Charles has no ideas Separate from magnificence; and, in this age of elaborate luxury, all means mull be taken to Support the glare of Show. Pardon me, Lucy, if I write rather too Severely of Charles ; but I have reaSon to be very much diSpleaSed with him. I Shall write to him Shortly, as fomething has occurred to prevent my paying my duty to my dear father and mother, and viSiting my native country, for fome time yet.
In about a month from this date, a friend, whom I much efteem, propoSes to be in London. You mull have heard of Lord Belgrave. His father, the late Lord, without any juft, or indeed plauSible reafon, baniShed his amiable Son, allowing him only a trifling annuity—trifling in comparison of his rank; yet he was never heard to murmur or complain. When, about three years Since, the late Earl was attacked by a malignant fever, he then Saw his error, and recalled his faultlefs Son, who only arrived time enough to take a laft farewell. The good, the pious youth. Shocked with his father’s death, at a time when he hoped to have been the Support of his declining years, could not bear the Scene; wherefore,
having
( 47 )
having given proper orders to his fteward, and paid his Sifters (whom I fuppoSe you may have Seen) their Sortunes, he returned again to the continent, where Providence threw him in my way, as a blefling that will Sweeten, I hope, my Suture liSe. He

Y credentials were Sent by the old Peer. Old Villars forwarded the anSwer immediately ; and I, on the ftrength of it, Set out for Rofe Mount with a five hundred pound note in my pocket, to fweeten the fatigues of the journey. I really have a kind of penchant for this lovely froft-piece; Ihe is certainly very charming. You never Saw her, I think, Hazzeldine ; therefore I will defcribe her to you. She is of the higher middle Size i has a moft delicate complexion, blue eyes, and fine brown hair, drelTcd in Some degree conformable to the fafhion, though Some of the ringlets are, fuffered to wanton at pleafure : then fhe has the moll beautiful hand and arm you ever Saw, and fo much dignity in her air and manner, that I cannot help admiring
her i and yet, when fhe Speaks, especially
if it be to an inferior, it is with fo much affability, and Ihe Smiles fo bewitchingly

Saturday evening, and found the lovely, the languid Harriet at cards with Lord Eaftmain, 6z:c. But how inattentive ! how abSent! how unlike the Harriet we have feen! Her countenance brightened up at my approach; it was obServed by Mel-mbth : I gave him one of my looks, and brought him to order in a minute; when Harriet and I retired to our chamber; for we Bept together'*. We Said every thing that could be Said on the occaSion: but it all ended in this woeful truth, that, after what had paffed, her fate was inevitable ; and, as Such, I begged of her to put on a more chearful countenance, left the lordly hufband, in his day. Should remember her reludtance. She promifed me She would obferve my advice; and endeavour ; but it was not in her power. At length the.dreaded Monday came; Joy in every countenance but Harriet’s and her Lucy’s yet I did all I could to be chearful my Self, and to make her So. But ’I have the advantage of raoft folks: what I want in natural good-humour, I make up in pertnefs; for I am never fullen: and it is all one,to rne, whether the company laugh at me, or with me.— The lovely girl was drefled in a pale blue watered tabby robe gown- and coat,

Mechlin lace linen, her cap ornamented with pearls, one row of pearl round her neck, and bracelets of the Same upon her delicate arms : and in this manner, like a lily overcharged with dew, was Ihe Jed by Lord Eaftmain to the great parlour, and there by a Special licence joined to Mr. Melmoth. I,> who had leiSure to observe every one, cannot help thinking that he Seemed rather to behave with an air of proud exultation than of tender joy. Mr. Villars and Peregrine are really joyful—for a joyful cauSe to them : but Lord Eaflmain—I really revere the good old man—Scarcely knows how to Show his love and efteem for his-new niece. —The jewels are come, and prefented : poor Harriet received them with that SweetneSs which accompanies all her actions. She placed them on her toilet, and with a deep Sigh Said,, “ Oh! Lucy, “ what have I given up for Such bau-“ bles 1”	1 endeavoured to laugh her

Her duty, of which She thinks So highly,
and
( 9Z )
and her natural good temper, will make her a more exemplary wiSe, than hundreds who marry with their own conSent. But it ought to be a very lively foul to keep Melmoth’s affedtions awake; one that would make him look about him: for his intentions, I fuppofe, are, like thoSe ' of all the free livers, to govern by fear inftead of love.—But hence reflection si No more complaints now : let me turn the bright fide of the profpeCI. The whole family will remain at Rofe Mount till after the Birtlvday: Mrs. Melmoth is then to come to town incog, to take leave of my ladylhip, as our family are to fet out for V‘ “ ■■■" in March or April; then they are to retire to Eahmain, there to refide till juft before the breaking up of parliament, when Mrs. Melmoth is to be prefented, as it is preSumed fhe will by that tirhe be reconciled to her fituationj and that her countenance will refume its wonted ferenity, if Melmoth does not before that time break her heart. I fay unfay all in a breath : in effeCt, I cannot perfuade myfelf to any degree of liking or efteem for this man ;

Lady Lucy was to fet out for Lincolnshire the next day, to attend the nuptials of a lady whom 1 have heard you mention in very reSpe<5tful terms i Mifs Vii-lars, if I miltake not.
You may remember, George, when we were at Florence, we took notice ’of an Englilh lady, who frequently went to the Britilh conSul’s, and always returned with an air of dejedtion : you may likewife remember the offers of Service we both made her; when fhe modeftly anSwered, that her griefs were of Such a nature as not to admit of any relief w^e could give her. This very lady, drclfed in widow’s weeds, I faw in the abbey church ; fhe had with her a lovely girl, about four years of age. I Spoke to her; -but fhe declined conversation with me.

In my way from Bath, I thought 1 would crofs the country, and pay a vifit to my:

He was ordered home to bring a chariot with all pofTible Speed to farmer Wells’s on the common, whither the ladies; permitted me to accompany them : indeed I was obliged to Support the younger, or fhe would have been unable to reach the deftined place.

My dear Lord Bel grave,

A M grieved and pleaSed beyond ex-preffion at 3'our laft. I will Set out as Soon as poISible from this place, nor hop till I reach England. Oh ! my Frederick, you have indeed a Scylla and a Charybdis to fear: although you have fhuniied one, I am afraid you will be wrecked on the other.

Even a good woman may be th means of' making your life unhappy i the amiable Mrs. Melmoth may creaie you almoft as much uneafmefs as the frail widow ; for, fliould you entertain a paf-Eon, although there is no' danger of that
be in

Love and elleem are widely different : the firff is ever due to virtue and SenSe i the other is Spontaneous, and will operate accordingly : nay farther, we often deceive ourSelves in regard to this paffion; and in that cafe it is not at all wonderful

Before you do any thing more for this fine widow, pray, my Frederick, inquire who and what fhe is. I am not apt to be narrow-minded; but I have my doubts concerning her. I have heard fom counts of Charles which give me pain ; I wifh you would inquire into the truth.. I will incloSe you the letter. You will fuppofe i do not doubt the veracity of the. writer, but of his" informant ; and Slander is apt to magnify objedts.

Mdmoth (yes, I muff call him wretch) is an infenfible being; he is blind to the good that courts him; he Scarcely treats her with common civility. Charles’s vnfe Seems to engage his preSent attention ; they are continually coquetting ; for Charles is abfent on an occafion which I am afraid
will end in his eternal difhonour.
Mr.
Villars is at the Spa, upon.another in-famous account; and Peregrine is attending my hopeful brother. Mr. Melmoth is a libertine, in every fenSe of the word ; he does not now even wifh to Save appearances ; he almoU diSdains to be thought virtuous, even in the preSence of his in-
ellimable wife.
Lord Eaftmain is ex-

LETTER XLII.
Lord Mulcester to Lady L. Temple.
AM' under the greateft apprehenfions, on your friend’s account. Lord Eaft-main has embarked for Lillion, as, I told you in my laft, his phyfidans had adviSed him: the tender, the grateful Harriet would have accompanied him, but he would not permit it, partly becaufe he thought her preSence might, perhaps, be Some reftraint on Mr. Melmoth’s condu<5l. An old gentlewoman, in the capacity of a nurSe, and liis chaplain, who is a pious fenSible man, are his companions. Lord Belgrave and my Self, with Mr. and Mrs. Melmoth, attended him to Portsmouth.
'—Melmoth is the moll unfeeling being I ever Saw, except where his interefl is concerned ; then indeed he can appear all foftneSs. His uncle is really fond of him notwithstanding his faults: he has absolutely perSuaded the good old gentleman (could you believe it ?) that a patent for a peerage will be obtained for him, and on the ftrength of it has obtained a considerable-

The latter, hardened man, had the aiSu-rance to afk the loan of two thoufand pounds of me to pay a debt of honour, as he called it. I refufed him, with Some little indignation; and yet, for his Sifter’s fake, endeavoured to reaSon with him: but he is loft; to all fenSe of reafoning. Good heaven ! that a man Should be So infatuated, ias to put on the call of a dye the eftate of which he is in poiTeffion from his anceftors! Yet who will deny, that he who hopes to win what belongs to another^ deServes to loSe his own ? And here, my dear Lucy, let me obServe, in the words of a favourite author,— There is Such a SameneSs in the lives, the aOions, the purSuits of libertines, and Such a likeneSs in the accidents,

On Monday was Se’nnight there was a private party at Mr. Mdmoth’s: Lady Harman and her niece were there; for Mrs, Melmotli (from regard to our family) behaves to them as politely as file can, considering how much fhe muft dillikc their conduct on all oceaSions. I fhould have firft told you, that I dined
there
(	.77 )
there by invitation, no one being preSent but Mr. and Mrs. Melmoth. ASter Harriet withdrew, he had the aiTurance Shall I call it ? it is too SoSt a name—to alk me for more money. My looks Spoke my aftoniShmcnt, as he mull SuppoSe I could not be ignorant of what had become-of the other, as Mrs. Vareny’s letter informed' you. I told him, I really could not advance any more, except Lord Eaft-main joined in the Security. This effectually filenced him. I took my hat, and was going ; but he begged my pardon, although with a Stifled refentment, as I could plainly perceive; and intreated me not to go, as his wife would fuSpedt Something if I did. I would not quarrel with him for that excellent Sufferer’s Sake therefore Sat dov/n again. He then Said he wished he had made a better uSe of

five hundred of

This, together with five hundred more borrowed on the moft exorbitant terms, was loft at Stapleton’s in a few hours.

LETTER
Mul€,ESTER, to Lady L.Temple-;
NEVER, my dear Lucy,, was in greater confternation,. doubt and anxiety, than< I am at^preSent.—On TueSday laft I received the incloSed, iinSealed,. under a cover, with a few lines to beg I would Seal it, and fend it to you by the firft' opportunity. I did not wonder at her. leaving, her brother’s,, but wifh Hie had. returned to town:: however as Ibe has described her Situation, and I doubt not the rectitude of her heart,., fhe mult be much happier than at RoSemount,. not-withllanding the malicious insinuations, thrown out. But there is no defcribing, tho,Se things, except you write to the time. preSent when the tranSadlions occurred.
On the Friday ifollowing I received packet from Lord Eaftmain, in anfwer to.-one which I had Sent,—not the account of Melmoth’s black adfions. I wilbed tO' Shew Mrs. Melmoth this letter, v/ith Such: an agreeable account of her uncle’s health.
I Set out poft without a Servant, as the retreat of Mrs. Mountney was not to be
known:
* * • . ^
( 207	)	.
known: but gueSs my furpriSe, at my arrival, to hear from an old perSon who was left in charge of the houfe, that the ladies had been gone away twenty hours before, and no one could tell whither.
I returned much chagrined, and was inclined to apprehend that Melraoth had found her out •, and yet I think it could fcarcely be polfible, as he is under the threat of the law. I had juft changed my drefs after my journey, when Charles came with an account that was current in all the ' coffee-houSes, and foon after confirmed by a letter from Sir James Hazzeldine to Mr, Afhford', that Lord Belgrave had wounded Mr. Melmoth (as it was apprehended, mortally) in a duel; that this rencounter happened near Cam-bray j and that Belgrave had taken Mrs, Melraoth away. Harriet’s not being to be found gives facdion to the report— to the fcandal, I ought to Say \ for Scandal I am Sure it is: altho’ Mrs. B——t, like Mrs. Blafl in the Spectator, has tired three pair of horSes to fly about the town and tell every one She comes near, that Mrs. Melmoth has run away with Lord Belgrave, and that his Lordfliip. has run Mr. Melmoth through the body, as the former was endeavouring to take his wife from him. InconSiflent as this flory is,

My dear Brother,

known on his arrival at V-------. Both
the

( 216 )
the Earl and CoiinteSs had Seen this nobleman at Versailles, but were only Tightly acquainted with him ; therefore this meS-fage could not fail of furpriSing us. A-coach and Suitable attendants, however, were Sent ; and that evening the Marquis came and prcSented to us a very agreeable young lady, who appeared much fatigued: the negligence of her dreSs, and the languor of her countenance, beSpoke a mind ill at eafe. A Ihort letter from Lord
Belgrave. partly explained the my fiery. His Lordlihip begged my mother to receive the young lady under her protection till his arrival at V——, which he hoped would be in a few a days. And now be
to learn, as follows, what oceans this honour : As. Lord Belgrave

the before*mentioned young lady from an old gentleman attended by three Servants, The old man defended his’

charge valiantly, till he was overpovv'ered by numbers. They were juft forcing the young lady into a chaife, when Lord
Belgrave
(	217	)
Belgrave came up and retook her ; in executing which he wounded the leader of this gang of worSe than robbers, whilft his Servants bound the other mafked man ; for the reft of the Servants, all but one SwjSs, had decamped.. By this time a company of peaSants, going to marketj came up; and the old gentleman being alSo wounded, by the alliftance of thoSe countrypeople he was got into his Lord-Ship’s carriage, which proceeded with him and the lady to Cambray, my Lord him-felf, on one of his Servants horSes, eScort-ing them ;

But the .Marquis de G caftle in the neighbourhood,
being at his and Lo’d
Belgrave being well known to him, he obtained leave for his Lordftiip to be a prisoner at large in his caftle, till the fate of the wounded perSons is known. The old gentleman is guardian to this young lady; and, as the Marquis propofed coming to his Lordfhip for his intereft to permit Lord Belgrave to purSue his tour
to V-------, the lady exprelSed So much
terror at the thought of flaying in or near the place where the wretches are who

would have forced her away, that Lord Belgrave propoSed, and was feconded by the Marquis, to intreat her guardian to
let her accompany him to V------*, and
remain under our protection, till a proper opportunity offers for her to go with Safety to England. Lord Belgrave, through my father’s mediation, was permitted to come hither laft night ; and his Lordfhip, the Marquis, and the Duke de C—i—, have given their words for his being forthcoming. 1 v/ould not write till this affair was in Some meaSure determined, (I mean, with regard to his Lordlhtip’s enlargement) left I ftiould keep you too much in SuSpence.
l am Sorry to tell you he is very much indiSpoSed, owing to his extreme fatigue and anxiety of mind. His too feeling heart, that thrills in every vein for Harriet, and for tliis recent buftle, has thrown him into a kind of a nervous fever ; and his phyficians have ordered him to be kept very quiet, and by no means be fuffered to write ; for which reaSon I am deputed his amanuenSis; and a w'onderful tale I have to tell.——Could you, without the
fpirit of divination, imagine, that the lady under our care is MiSs Del Rio, and the wounded ruffian Melmoth ? From thefe circumftances proceeds poor Frederick’s

a natural,

As his Lordship is So Ilridtly commanded not to write, you muft thereSore expedt but a broken narrative, in which I mull relate as Srom the young lady’s mouth, and which cannot quite do her jullice: becauSe She cannot Speak French So duent as Spanilh, and I do not understand the latter, consequently it will loSe much of that Sweet manner of expreffion, which

This friendship (for Such it then appeared) overcarne me: I thanked her in the moft grateful terms, and no longer heSitated to go on board the veflel; where I found the gentleman who is now left wounded at Cambray, and whofe name I find is Melmoth, and a young lady, whom he Said he had brought to attend me. I Should have told you, Holland was our place of deftination, and pointed out to me as the only place of Safety for me. Both Sir James’s Sifter and the young lady Seemed to ftrive which Ihould Shew me rrioft civilities; yet I was overwhelmed with confulion to think what a fooliSh runaway I muft appear in the eyes of indifferent people. To Holland we came; and there, after Some time it was pointed out to me, both by Mr. Melmoth and Sir James’s Sifter, that, from fome hints which had been thrown out, my reputation would Suffer, if I did not con-deScend to' accept of Sir James for a hulband.

Where is this fame Mrs. B-—t, whom you So properly call Mrs. Blaji? Cannot you contrive to Smuggle her to me.? If you could, we wjuld have her ducked in the Danube to waSh away Some of the poifon of her tongue, and afterwards fend her to work in the mines to purify her ideas; and, if all that did not anSwer the end^ then She Should go to a round tower in the foreSts of Siberia, and vent her fcandal to the wolves and other beaSls of prey that would howl nightly under her window; for their howlirigs^ the voice naturfe has given them, would be preferable to her horrid aSperfions on the innocent.

where I left off: I went, as I propofed, to Newbury, and eaSily found out the houSe of the Mrs. or MiSs Spencer. I was without an attendant for prudential
which you may guefs. I afked for the lady of the raanSion, where I Saw very genteel woman, as to outward appearance. I inquired if Mrs. Melmoth was there She readily anSwered, Yes; but fhe was Sick in bed. I begged ray refpe(5ls, and fent up my name. Saying I wifhed that I could be permitted to fee her for a few minutes. MiSs Spencer went up; but returning; fhe anSwered, that Mrs. Melmoth was too ill to Speak with any one. “ What 1 not to Lord
“ Mulcefter?”
a

( 237 )
Mulceller.?” (Said I with an emphaSis.) “ No, Sir, (Said Ihe) not even to you.’* I was quite dilconcerted, and dired:ly returned to Newbury. By the way I reasoned with mySelS; Perhaps (Said I) She might be fearful it fliould be Some of Melmoth’s emilTaries on a feigned pretence. I then wifhed I had fent up my name in writing. But, on my arrival at the inn, I inquired more minutely into the characSter of MiSs Spencer; when I was informed to my heart-felt grief, that MiSs Spencer was a discarded miftreSs of Sir Charles Barham’s j and that She had come down and taken that houSe, and brought with her a young lady who was kept by a French nobleman, and who indeed was miflreSs of the houSe more properly, as every thing was done by her direction, and all the Servants were at her command i and that She had frequently been there on a market-day, and the nobleman with her; that he was very fond of her; and no wonder as She was very handSome; but that the lady had been very ill. I was affliDed beyond any thing you can imagine ; for a fall from virtue, in Such a chara6ler as Mrs. Melmoth’s, v/hat a triumph to the dilTolute of both Sexes!—And yet it cannot be: there are So many excellencies in the poor
fugitive,
( 2

fugitive, that if mull be misrepresentation. I am bewildered with thought—the people .are So poSitive in their aflertions, yet the general tenor of her life is So contrary to thoSe affertions. But her refuSal to See me, the brother of her dearefl friend, and one who valued her So much himSelf, has more weight with me than any thing that is Said. Does it imply the was conScious of Something wrong and did not with to See me .f* To leave nothing undone, I wrote to her from the inn at Newbury, and returned to town with a heavy heart, having received for anSwer that She would write to me within a few days. In this matter an indifferent perSon would be led to conclude that there could be no artifice, as the wom2tnAcknowkdged that Mrs. Melmoth was in the houSe; a circum-fiance which, had that lady been detained by force or fraud, it is to be fuppofed that She would have denied.
I went the next day to WindSor, where I waited, having left proper diredlions, and hoping that Mrs. Melmoth might by that time have thought proper to write to me; but was informed that Mr. and Mrs. Vareny had Sent three Several for me, intreating to fee me. Without changing my riding*drefs, I waited on them, and was informed that Mrs. Mount-

but Mrs. Mountney believes this to be- merely pretence, and apprehends they are Somewhere in the neighbourhood of Southampton, and, as the Duke’s equipage is So remarkable, thinks we might eaSily trace them. She gave this account with tears to Mrs. Vareny, who deScribes her as a lovely woman.
We are all unhappy, as you may well fuppoSe; for this intelligence cannot, I think, be doubted. And yet, for fo amiable a perfon to plunge at once headlong into vice, is aimoft beyond belief. Mrs..

ther they were gone was uncertain. Slip called a fervant, who told' me they pro-pofed going to Portsmouth, and from thence for Lifbon. I muft own this gave me a glimpfe of hope that Harriet had withdrawn herSelf from that woman thro’ diSguft, and might poflibly have put her-felf under the Duke’s protection to con-duCt her to her brother’s. Faint as this hope was, I crolled the country to RoSe Mount, and there Saw a fcene of deSolation. How unlike the elegant place it once was!

Mr. Marcel arrived here iafb night, but with much difficulty; is now obliged to keep his room. The Spirit of'a true Engliili merchant Shews itfelf in this old gentleman. He has prefented the ConnteSs with a moil Superb piece of gilt plate in the fhape of a cabinet, but So contrived that it will anSwer the end of a complete toilette. To the Marquis he has given, a.s a mark of his gratitude, an Englifh Watch of great value'; but fays he has-reServed for Lord Belgrave an inedimable jewel. Cannot you gueSs, George, what this jewel is? But that will never do; for Lord Belgrave,. were his heart at liberty,, is too delicate to accept a woman who '

But, when I found it was her curSed charms that deprived me of Belgrave, I vowed revenge ; for which reaSon I joined more heartily with Melmoth in all his fchemes, and got her into my power, and make no doubt but I fhould have humbled her, had it not been for that officious apoflate, Tom Conway. But, to do her juflice, She behaved becoming the character llie afSumed—very obflinate, and very virtuous ; for nothing but force could have prevailed with her, although I believe the Duke would have married her, had fhe been at liberty, hev/as So infatuated with her. And yet I fee nothing fo
very extraordinary in her---
faye—no life, no airs. Had fhe not got off as fhe did, not all her virtue could have Saved her, Melmoth being determined to be divorced from her, but for a trick, which I did not know till laft week, that Sir James and his crew have Served me. I will let you into all their Schemes. As for Tom Conway, he fhould not have betrayed US; for I have Supported him theSe three years pafl : nor indeed fhould I

As foon as Lord Eaft-main went to town on your Summons, Lord Charles and the Marquis Set out for Gloucefterfhire; but, on the way, Charles prevailed on him to call on Sir Alexander Nelbit, on the borders of our county. Sir i\.lexander is very hofpitable, and loves convivial friends. The Marquis was pleaSed with his reception, and the
beautiful

( aS7 )
beautiful Situation of Nefbit wood ; therefore they took up their reSidence with him for Some days. But one morning the Marquis, being an early rifer, attended only by his valet. Sallied forth on horfe-backfvcry Imprudent, you will fiiy, when neither of them could fpeak Englifh) : they rode on till they came to the foreft ; where a deer rulhinghaftily from a thicket, the Marquis's horfe took fright, and ran away with him. He kept his feat for Some time ; but, finding no hopes of the creature’s flopping, he threw himSelf off, and thereby broke his leg and diflocated his flioulder. In this condition he was carried by Some poor haymakers to the next village, where there is a tolerable inn ; and a man was dispatched to the next town, at four miles distance, for a Surgeon. In the mean time the poor diftrelSed Marquis, impatient of being amidfl flrangers, who could not under-fland one word of what he Said, made Signs for Some perSon to write a letter, but in vain, till a neighbouring lady was fo kind to come and converfe Some time with him, and by her means a note was dispatched to Mr. Temple, who immediately came away with Sir Alexander; for the Servant was not then returned with the news. He was gone twenty miles another way, miflaking the road, in Search
of
• ( 288 )
of his mailer. Mr. Temple fent away poll for me. I luckily was at home, and fet out with the melTenger. When 1 Arrived, I found the Surgeons had juft fet the frartures : they alTured me the Marquis was in a fair way, if he were kept quiet. You know.

time to contemplate the melancholy contents of your packet to me to inform me of Mrs. Melmoth’s death. In the midft of my grief on that account, the Marquis, finding himSelf much eaSier, and able to converSe, told me how much he was obliged to the lady who So humanely came to him. In all his life, he Said, he never Saw a more beautiful creature, or one in whom Such dignity and SweetneSs were mingled, whilft fhe Spoke to him: but, when,fhe heard the name of Temple, Ihe trembled, turned pale, and went to the window •, but, immediately recolle<ft-ing herSelf, took a hafty leave, and Said fhe would take care a note fhould be Sent to Sir Alexander’s ; which you know fhe

for Belgrave. But, when we retired to
the drawing-room after dinner, how much were we Surprized to fee her take out Lord Bcigrave’s letter, and, waving her hand in the moil graceful manner, commanded our attention : “ My good Lord Belgrave, (Said fhe) here are none but friends preSent; friends to whorn I am under the greateft obligations.—-Your Lordfhip in this letter does the poor Harriet the higheft honour. I am not inSenfible to your merit, beft and wor-thiefl of m*cn ! and, were I to give way to inclination, you would I choofe from all mankind.

Here Mrs. Melmoth ceafed, and withdrew ; leaving Belgrave, and the whole company, in Silent aftonifliment, following her with their eyes, condemning^ and yet admiring her. Poor Lord Belgrave !; all efforts have been uSed, but to no purpofe. She is fixed as fate, and has declared, if any further importunities are ufed with her, flic will retire from all our knowledge. I never Saw a perSon fo fleady in their refolmion. In the bloorn of youth, to give up the man whom flie floated on, from a point of delicacy, and yet, let me fay, a juft one-—is not this the teft of virtue, and the pra<5tiSer of it f My dearefl: friend! how much do I adore her, although flie has disappointed my mofl Sanguine hopes! Oh! George, the diSconfolatc Belgrave is now preparing for

Mulcester. to Lord Belgrave.
Yes, my dear Lord Belgrave, I have been informed of. all by Lucy.-— What Ihall I fay to comfort my friend ? —To expatiate on the excellence, the
cc of Mrs. jMelmothj would be
but

( 319 )
but poor conSoIation. However, it may be proper to inform you, that by my filler’s laft packet I find that, your 1 aft viSit to that lady having given occafion to the talkers to blaze abroad an account that a treaty of marriage was concluded between you, the lovely, injured Harriet was traduced in all companies on this account. This, like the reft of her Sufferings, She bore with a faint-like patience, till, your departure being known, the report was contradi(5led.—--It is well,
“ (Said (he then, lifting her fine eyes to heaven) this is the laft of my trials Amiable youth!—the world no more fhall persecute us: for we muft now “ remain, and it is fit wfe ftiould' where “ mountains. Teas, and deSerts muft di-“ vide us.”
The pearly drop ftood in her eyes while fhe Spoke thus—“ Forgive my weakneSs, “ (Said fhe) but tliis is the laft tribute “ I Shall pay to the memory of my de-parted happineSs.”—Lucy Said more: but, as this is the Sum of all, here I ftop.—1 Shall only add, that Lord Eaft-main, who has fettled all his eftate upon his amiable niece, has rnade her a prefeni of a little rural retreat, about ten miles

who is to remain there till flie can place herSelf in a convent. Lord B--.—, my Sifter, and Mrs. Vareny, arc all thoSe in England, that (he will permit to write to, or viSit her. She added, however, that ftie Should be glad to hear from me, and that, from any other hand than your own. She Should be happy to hear of your welfare.
Having thus given you all the fatis-fadtion in'my power, let me conjure you, my friend, to Summon all your philoSophy to your aid; nor, while yet in the bloom of youth, to refufe wilfully thoSc innocent pleaSure.s, which the Supreme-Being has interSperSed through the Scenes of life to make our journey agreeable. Remember that, as a finite being, you ought to be reSigned to the will of Heaven. Remember that, as a man, you ought not to be excelled by a w'oman, though the moft amiable of her Sex, in fortitude. And, finally, remember that you ought to preserve your life, becauSe it is the^gift of the Creator, and the continuance of it" is of the utmoft, conSequence to all
friends, and. to none more than to
Your rrioft affedlionate

G. Muicester.
