As to my Family, you will find enough of that in the IntroduEhon So I shall only be particular in what regards mySelf, and that Branch of it from wheixe I derive my Being.	v
You must know therefore, that we are very longa^vous, that is, we live a great while j for theSe many Generations there has Scarce died one of us on this fide of one hundred Years; my Grandfather iMd to O ne Hundred and Thirty; my Father indeed died, as I may call it, a young Man, not having exceeded FourScore and Five; but that was the Estedc of his dealing with the Dodors, a Folly I have therefore carefully avoided. . My Mother is yet alive, and having already taken a Walk in this Vale of Mortality one Hundred Years, Seems reSolvM on tVthef Turn for a Second Century.

In the Room of a Wife, I have a very good old Woman for my HouSe-keeper,-who has many uSeful Qtialities ; but chiessy she has a profound Skill in curing broken Shins, Faces or Elbows, from whence I have found great Benefit; for it has been always a Malady of our Family, that the Master of it, before he goes to Bed, is troubled wdth a Sort of Titubation, which is frequently the CauSe of Some ContLifions, as well as Some Crudities the next Morning, againist both of which my

HocSe-keeper is ready with an agreeabl and proper Medicine^ a Tankard of good brown Ale, and a Toast and Nutmeg, with a nice of the best CheeSe, is my ge-
Soinetimes she diverfifies it
neral Recipe; with a Glafs of Sack, for I abominate a Dram ; it is like ill Advice, it may pleaSe indeed, but always draws on an evil Con-Sequence.
I get up with the Sun, take the Air in the Fields, either on my Pad, or on Foot; then returning to my Chamber, 1 divert mySelf with an Author till Dinner-time. But of all Authors, I love Such as entertain my Fancy, leaving the crabbed Trads Oi PliiloSopiiy and Divinity to them who have more Time on their Hands than I have, and more Patience too.

At Dinner I"eat heartily, andfif Friends come in, I take a chirping Bottle; and then purSue what Sports are in SeaSon, till the dusky Hour Summons us to a Mug of OBober or Marchy till my old Woman puts me in Mind that it is Time to withdraw to Bed, where I Sleep without Dreams, till my nfiial Hour oS rifing; and this is my CourSe of Lite, as a Country Gentleman.
I come new to my (Qualifications as a Writer ,* you will not find in my Study many Polid.s; I think, befides Don Quixetey I have none but our Englijh Poets. I deal all in Abridgments, and other Brachil'o-

I cannot omit Fontinelky who has furnish"d my Study with two valuable Pieces, Lhe Hiflory of Oracksy and Fhe Plurality of Worlds. Mr. Vandale^ a Learned Dutch-man, writ a voluminous Book to prove, that the Oracles of the

Heathens were not deliver’d by the Devil, but the Priefis. Mr. Fontinelk ^ liking the Defign, and approving the Arguments, brings all into a little Pocket Volume, and yet leaves the Point beyond a Reply, which was as much as Vandale cou’d do in his larger Work. Phe Plurality of Worlds is another Proof of the admirable AddreSs of this Author; for in a very Small CompaSs he lets his Reader into the three Systems of Astronomy So plainly, and with So much EaSc, that a Lad^^ may be a Judge of them-For my part, who have no BufineSs with the Planets and Stars further than my A-muSement, I have never given my Self the Trouble of any further Enquiry about them. The Paradoxes of Cicero, the EpiS-tles of Seneca, the Satyrs and Epistles of Horace, the Dialogues of Lucian, and the rest of the Antients, who have given-us agreeable Things in short DiScourfes.
Yet this mighty Inclination of mine to this short Sort of Writing, never made me fond ot Martial; nay, I have often blam’d the Method of our common Schools for reading him to our very Boys, becauSe he debauches their Taste of Poetry, and makes themiever after relish nothing but Such Bag-gatelks as Points in all manner of Poetry.
This

PREFACE.
This being my Taste of Authors antient .and modern, thou wilt not, gentle Reader, be SurprizM, that when I write mySelf, I Lpin not out my Matter in Length, or that I chuSe Subjefts that may be kept within the narrow Bounds of a Letter : But that which determstSd me to this way of late Years, has been the Observation that I have made of the Gust of the Times. I jind most Readers are of my Mind, and love not to dwell long on any thing. This gave SucceSs to the Patlers ^ the SpeSiators, the Ltty-Monk, and the like, which are a Sort of Epistles to the Publick, Such as I now preSent thee, tho^ not in the fame Form.
This brings me to the following Book, which confists of fo great a Variety of Matter, as well as Manner, that I think there is Something in Some of them that will pleafe you all. I know^ not how it is, but this Colledion Seems to me far beyond that which I gave the Town with SucceSs Some Years ago under the Name of Phe Packet Iroke open^ or Phe Poji-Boy rcPd of Ms Mail. Perhaps, like carnal Fathers, we are always fondest of our youngest Children. I shall not be So much of an Author to point .out to you every Beauty, that you may find in my Work, I shall leave that to thy x>wnjiidgment \ and yet I carist but recommend

mend to thee the passionate Love-Letters cS the iair Stremunia, I think the most valuable we have Seen in Print of that kinei I Supp-oSe they are genuine j and indeed they bring their own Credentials, for no Body that was not fully poffest of that Past fion, cou’d write So feelingly of its Torments and Pangs.
I wish I had more on the Subje<st for the Ladies fakes j but in the next Volume I promiSe to make them Amends with two valuable Packets of Love-Letters : And I defire the Ladies, who have any of that Kind by them, to fend them to my Book-Seller’s direded to me. The Same I Say to the Gentlemen who have any thing in the Epistolary Way by them, and have a Mind to communicate their Produdions to th
w
World ,• and if I like them as well as they do, the Piiblick shall have their Turn in being pleas’d with them too. There will be Some Things befide Love, in the Second Volume, which will be worth the Reading, as the Packet of an Arabian Spy, who liv’d Some Years in Europe^ eSpecially in England: The Reformation and Improvement of the Englijh Theatre, with a Sort of ■Historical Charaders of the Patentees, and ■the principal Adors of both Companies ; And Several other extraordinary Rarities,

Some of our late Controvertists are much

O	I© ago from	with my old Friend

( O
who, having been abSent a great while in their Ramble about Europe^ were now directly going for England, which Country, though not the Soil of their Nativity, was very much lov’d and valu’d by them both. Wherefore joining with them and their Retinue, we made tlie best of our way for Calais; whence pasting to Dover^ we found our Servants ready to receive us with our own HorSes ; upon which we Set forward on our Journey towards London^ though I had engag’d the Company to take my HouSe at Bromley in Kent in' their way, and there refresh themSelyes for a few Days.
We got to this fide of Rocbejier without any manner of Adventure worth notice ; but we had not rid many Miles on-ward, but my Spaniel Bitch, which my Man Jeojfry had brought with him, beating about the Road, was very buSy in one of the Ditches 3 which my Man observing, examines into theReaSonof it, and finds her lugging at a Sort of a Portmantua ; which Jeoffry^ on diSmounting, found to be a ■.-|VIail, and we all concluded (what on Enquiry we afterwards found true) that the Post-man of that Road had been rob’d, and that the ^Thieves had thrown this Mail astde as not to their PurpoSe.
I know not what Devil of Curiostty prevail’d with me, but I order’d 3eoj[f/y to take it up, and bear it along with us.
Soon after we found another on the Brink of a Pond, but by good Luck not wet 3 this encreastng our Cargoe, we struck out of the publick Road, and got with the Dusk of the Evening to my HouSe near B.omley.
Supper
( 3 )
Supper being over, and all other Incumbrances, as well as the Women, and Scandal being remov’d, Pipes and Tobaccoy and excellent OBo-hery Succeeded ; for the Company, cloy’d with Wine in their Foreign Travels, choSe Malt before the Grape here in England.
Well, Gentlemen, (Said I) what dp you imagine was the Motive of my ordering jeoffry to bring Home the Mails we found on the Road ? Why truly, Sir Roger (affum’d Jack^DoTonright:') I did not think well of it by any means, lince it might have been the CauSe of SomeTrouble to us, had they been found among us : But I have fince confider’d, that your being a Justice of the Peace and Quorum of this County, that Magistratical Authority wou’d bear us out.
For my part, (Said the Baron) Sir Roger DE Whimsey is well known, and his Temper and Adventures So famous, that I expe(st Something very pleaSant from this Proceedure.
Why truly, (Said I) my Lord, I am pretty well known in my own proper Perfon, and more by my Family, which is Spread by Marriages, Inter-marriages, and Alliances, through all the Counties of England and tVaris; (as for Scotlandy I confeSs I know little, my Travels h living been Seldom Northward) : There is Scarce a Family of Note, of Wealth or Pow’r, but I am either a-kin to, or extreamly well receiv’d by it. Among the Ladies none have met with better SucceSs than the HouSe of the De Whim-feys; nor have we had many Wits, at least Suc-ceSsful Wits, who have not been r^ated to us, or fubmitted to our Advice land Direction. In short, the Antiquity of our Family in France^
B z ‘	(for
I

( 4 )
(For we came into England with the Conqueror) I believe might be trac’d as far as King Peftn^ iif not to Pharamond the First.
Ky> ^y> (interrupted Jackf) you are always bragging of the Antiquity of your French Pedh gree. I’ll allow it you, and add CFdfericy and the rest of the Morovean Race, who were fo nearly related to the Family of the De Whim-feysy that they Suffer’d the rower of the Mayors oj the Palace to get to that head, as to be able to wrest the Sovereignty of France out of their Hands. But I thank my Stars, I come of another Stock , the old tough Saxon Race ; the Dou'nrights had rather have their Genealogy drawn from HengiJPa and Horfabs Groom, than from a Privy CounSellor to Pharamond^ ChilferiCy and the rest.
On the contrary, I will own that the Family of the Dou'nrights is Ib far from being So numerous as that of the De Whimfeys^ that I never cou’d hear of any Branch of our HouSe in any County of England ; if there are any, they are fo obScure that it keeps them from being taken notice of. As for the Do^nrights of Dounright-Half we have made shift to keep a pretty Country Gentlemin’s Estate of about 500 Pounds a Year from Generation to Generation. We have never had any Ways and Means of encrealing our Revenue ; for we were never gracious in the Eyes of Kings, Princes, Great Lords, Statesmen, or Scurvy Politicians, nor in thofe of any of the Fortune Menders : Nay, the very Ladies coil’d never endure us ; and indeed, we Seem never to have been So fond of Impertinence, as to flatter the Women into ComplaiSance. In
the
( 5 )
the Days of Old England, when Knighthood was confer’d on the Merit of the Sword, our Family was Seldom without a Knight; but Since that Martial Honour has been thrown on Quacks, Cits, Lawyers, and the like, the Doivn-rights have never been more than your humble Servant ^ohn Doivnright ESq; an honest Englijh Country Gentleman.
We have few Acquaintance, for few are pleas’d with our plain blutit Manner, which has Sav’d us a great deal in HouSe-keeping from Gc" neration to Generation.
But, dear Sir Knight, theSe Baggatelleslaid a-llde, I prithee tell us the Motives that engag’d thee to take up theSe Mails.
Ay, my Lad, ( Said I ) that is indeed to the Point. Why, to be plain with you, I had a mind to look into the Letters, promiling my-lelf Some fort of Diverfion by the different Manners, Ways, Sentiments, Opinions, and the like, of the Several Writers ; who in private Letters are more free of their Minds than in any publick DiScourSes.
I approve your Thought, ( Said the Chevalier Du Hangout ) there may be much USe and Instru£lion, as well as Diverfion, in this Fro-lick.
As for the Letters of BufineSs, ( Said I ) we will immediately difpatch them to the Post, that no Body may be a Sufferer for our Pleasure.
This being agreed on, the next Day I Spent all the Morning in Sorting the Letters, and stn^^ ing away thole that requir’d Difpatch ; In.
B 5	After-

( ^ )
Afternoon all things being in order, the Baron, the Chevalier, MySelf, and Mr. Doivnnght^ began the Enquiry ; the Substance of which I now communicate to the Publick, who am the Publick’s

I.
To the Reverend Mr. A, B, near Cart*
terhurfy Kent.
TIhat Religion in the World is only H u m o u R.'
4
Reverend Sir^
Your Letter of the 19th uh. gave nae
a little Surprize on the first PeruSal. I knew you, or thought at least that 1 knew you, to be a Man of a Settled Principle, of a great deal of Piety, and a Sound Divine ; and therefore cou’d not imagine why you shou’d Seek my Thoughts of Religion, a Subject for which you were infinitely better qualified. But fince you have been pleas’d to impoSe the Task , I Shall make no Scruple of giving you my Sentiments, fince the Privacy of a Letter Secures me from the CenSure of the Malicious, who are noiSy generally against what their Ignorance shall wrest to an ill Meaning, ■and make that against Religion, which is only against their Opinions.
First then, I am perfectly of your Opinion, that Religion, that Divine Band, which binds us to our great and good God , confiSts chiefly in ABion^ for ChdtffhKfm every where ex-prcflfes it as the Rule of our Faith 5 he will
B 4	not

(8)
\
not allow of the Religion (f Tongue , it must be of the Heart, exerted in the Love of God above all things, and our Neighbour as our-felves; and he judges of the Love of God by the Love we shew our Neighbour ; nay, the MeaSure of our Condemnation at the Last Day is taken from our Deficiency in doing Good to our Neighbour ; He plainly tells us, that not thoSe who Say to me Lord. Lord, but thoSe who do the Will of his Father, should be accepted by him ; which Will is through the whole GoSpel made Sufficiently to appear to be in A6lion. For indeed, if crying Lord^ Lord^ and being noily Zealots with the Tongue for Speculations, made a Chrijiian^ and were a Part of the Scripture-Religion, never was a more Religious Age than the prefent: Whereas a Man must be guided by a more than.ordinary LavishneSs of Credulity, to Suppofc one in ten thouSand of theSe Tongue-Religionaries have any share of true Religion.
Having premised this, I shall with the more Freedom tell you ray Opinion of Religion^ as it is now generally pra^is’d throughout the World. I find in my Lord Broohj's Remains this Couplet:
Humour is "Mens Religion, Power tleir Laws, *XKir Wit Confufion^ and their Will their Caufe.
t
A very Severe Satire on Mankind, and the more fevere, becauSe I am afraid it is too true in the general; and I fear it would be no eaSy matter to find any great Number of Exceptions to this general Rule.
But
(?)
But here I have nothing to do with any thing but the first Part of the first Line,-Humour ts
Mens Religion.
And this I think is Sufficiently evident from the great Variety of Religions through all Ages, and Nations 3 for if Men had always, and every where built their Religion on Truth and Rea-fon, all the World wou’d be of one Religion, fince Truth is but one, and ReaSon the Same among all Men 5 If this were the Rule of Condufl of Men in this particular, the Scripture Christian Religion wou’d be Catholick or UniverSal 3 for So it is in its Nature and Constitution. But a general Defeflion from ReaSon, which first corrupted the World, and brought all the MiSe-ries, both of Body and Mind, which have shaken that Peace and HappineSs which Supream ReaSon, that is God, had defign’d us for, admitted the Passions, By-Interests, Fancies, and Humours of Men to form, or rather deform this holy Band, which with an eaSy Tie bound our Souls to God 3 and So rob’d us of the most certain Security of our temporal as well as eternal HappineSs.
But this Maxim of my Lord Brookj will yet be plainer, by a short and curSory View of the different Sentiments of Bodies of People, that is, of the Nations of the Earth, which loudly proclaim Fancy and Humour their Source.
Every Nation almost had Gods of their own, to whom they assign’d the Proteflion of their Country 3 for though the univerSal Moral Religion was more or lefs Spread through them all, yet the Politicians and Priests imagin’d that a Principle, which made all Mankind one Fa-
B 5
mily
( 10 )
%
inily and one People, would not anSwer their Ends; fince the Power they aim’d at was to be Settled and maintain’d by Divifion, and the Enmity of Nations 3 to confirm which, each Set up his God, to bring Heaven into their'Quarrels, and justify their Invafions of their Neighbours; and hence aroSe Tyranny and Extent of Dominion , which yet keep the World at odds.
For whilst the Gods Said only what the Priests wou’d have them, and the Priests were at the Command of the Princes, theSe cou’d never want heavenly Vouchers for their A£Hons, whether against their own Subjects, or Foreign Nations.
Many of the antlent Eastern People thought it Religion to adore the Sun and Moon, and the rest of the Host of Heaven, as the Peruvians like-
wiSe did when first diScover’d.
Others made themSelves Images Sometimes of Men, and Sometimes of mixt Natures, that is, compos’d of Man and Beast, or of Fish and Man, as the Dagon of the PhiliJUnes.
Sometimes of beautiful Women, as AJiarte, and Venm. Many Indian Nations have their Idols the most terrible and frightful that they can form or imagine : And to theSe they offer’d not only mere Animals in great Numbers, but even Men, Women, and Children : As the old Bnfo»5 particularly, whjo, filling a Wicker Machine with People, conSum’d them all with Fire, as an agreeable and atoning Oblation to their
Gods.
The
C11)
The Bmianr -ptace all their Religion in making HoSpitals for lick and diSabled Cartel, and other Beasts, and in reSraining from eating any thing that has Life in it 5 though at the Same time they are the most immoral Rogues in the UniverSe, the greatest Extortioners, USurers, and Cheaters.

But it wou’d be endleSs to run through th fantastick Roll of the PolytheiSm, which I believe will eastly be granted to be mere Humour, Caprice, and the like, and to bear not the least: ReSemblance of true Religion. We will therefore quit them, and come to thoSe who are called Chri/?w«5. But, alas ! we shall find the matter not much mended, or Religion much more remov’d from Fancy and Humour.
To begin with that large Body of Chriflians^, the Romamfis. The Church of Rome has admitted almost all the Follies and Impieties of the Heathens, to which she has added not a few of her own. The Worship of Images, and of Saints and Angels, differs very little, if at all, from the Adoration of the Idols of the Several Gods of the Pagan Nations ; they have added the praying for the Dead, and the making of Gods, and then eatint? them, with various other WhimSeys, obvious and known to every one. 1iL\\eRomamJh think it Religion to go in Pilgrimage to Some Saint’s Shrine, or Chapel, and in that they rival the Tvld ometans. They put ridiculoussy their Faith and Religion in the lyingWonders, and ridiculous Miracles,oFwhich their Legends are full, and which they read with that Reverence we pay the Holy Scriptures. Some of them are extreamly fantastical;
B ^	as
(ll)
as for Example, I have read this in the Life of
St-Catherine of Sienna. She was a Cook-maid in that famous City in Itah^ and that she might have time to pray, the Angels us’d to wash her Dishes ; and she by this Means grew into Such high Favour with Heaven, that the Virgin Mother, and JeSus Christ frequently convers’d with her. Our Saviour at last took out her Heart, and put his own into her Body; and to complete her HappineSs, he married her, and David play’d on the Harp, while the An-, gels danc’d; but whether they danc’d Minuets, or Country Dances, my Author does not determine. She had a most Sagacious NoSe to Smell out Mortal Sin ; and when her Father Confeffor came to her from his MiS-treSs or Whore, she knew it by the Scent, and So rebuk’d him for his WickedneSs.
There was another Saint, called St. Simon Stelites. This great Saint, to arrive at a more than common Perfedfion, retir’d to a DeSart, and had there a Pillar ere6ted eighteen Foot high, and no broader at the Top, than to afford room for one Foot; So that St. Simon be-ing got to the Top of it, stood upon one Leg for many Years together, Day and Night; how he ssept, or what Food he had, or how he came by it, I cannot remember.
The latter end o-f the Saints Lives^ in a large thick Quarto, has the Lives of Some Modern Saints, and of Some who were only beatified ; for Beatification does not cost half the Money that a Canonization does, and does the Bufi-neSs every whit as well, for you may pray to one as well as the other.. Among the rest, it
tells
( 13 )
tells us of one, who having a Fit of Siclcnels, his Phystcian told him, that nothing but eating Flesh would Save his Life 3 but to oblige him to this, the absolute Command of his Superiors was necessary ; So a Chicken was prepar’d and brought to the Table: But the good Man still unwilling to eat it, prayed to God that he might avoid the eating it, and yet not diS-obey his Superiors. Immediately the Chicken Sprung out of the Dish, and stew out of Window.
But it would be endleSs to relate all the Absurdities of which theSe Men compoSe Religion, for whatever Fancy and Humour could Suggest fills up the Roll. So that I believe most Men, who are not Papists, will give up the Church of Rome likewiie into the Number of thoSe Men, whoSe Relt2;ion is Humour.
And to them we may add the Church, and all its under Churches, which entertain the like Notions.
We come therefore of CoUrSe to the Reform’d Congregations 3 and omitting the Con-fideration of all thoSe of a Foreign Establishment 3 for Brevity Sake, we will only touch upon thoSe we have among us : And 1 fincere-ly wish that Fancy and Humour would be found banish’d entirely from them. But here likewise, we Seem willing to compound with Heaven on the eafiest Terms we can, and place our chief Zeal in the Circumstantials of Religion, and not in the Goffel EjpntialSy from whence have arilen theSe Differences, theSe Feuds, and theSe Animofities amongst us. Whereas, if we made the plain and eaSy Doctrines
■ff."
(14)	'
trines of ^effps Chriji our Religion, we should agree in a perfect Love and Unanimity, and by loving one another, prove that we are the DiSciples of the Lord.
But alas! To do that, would be to banish all our Vices, our Pride, our Avarice, our Revenge, four Ambition. ^ We should no more struggle or the Superiority, nor the Power of impofing the Do£lrines of Men on our Neighbours, nor damn all thoSe who have not the fame SenSe of fome obScure and difficult, at least doubtful PaCSages and Expressions in the Scripture; but every one endeavour to work out his own Salvation, and leave the Conscience to the Judgment and Diredlion of God, who can only judge truly of it.
Thus, Some place all Religion in going to Church, a much easser Task than to master our corrupt Appetites, forgive an Injury, love God above all Things, and our Neighbour as ourfelves. The Ladies are particularly zealous for this Point; for by going to Church, they sh ew themfelves and their fine Cloaths, and can come home full of as manyjll Humours to their Families and Husbands, as they went with.
But I forget that I am writing a Letter and not a TreatiSe, which stops me in the midst of my Subje£l, that must for that ReaSon be de-fer’d to another Opportunity. If ever I turn Author, it shall be upon this Subje£l; and yet I fear I should be thought guilty of a Sort of Don QMxotifm^ whilst I strive to re-establifh the Purity of a GoSpel Religion, when I am like to find too many of the very Preachers of
the
(o)
the GoSpel itSelf my Enemies, as well as the wicked Laiety. An Heretic perhaps might be the mildest Term, and Appellation I should meet with. But tho’ I have made you here a double Letter, yet there is starce room left to afiSure you, that I am
Your jtncere Friend and Servant^
Abel Truelove.
When this long Letter was perus’d: I fipd jfSaid the B^row) that Religion has a (^ality of the Manna of old, in which every one finds that Taste he likes best. Or rather (aCSum’d the Chevalier') Rtligion by this Letter is like the Tarrand or Camelion^ that, they Say, change their Colours according to the Herb or Flower they lie before.
But that Ambition, Thirst of Empire, and Scurvy Politicks, gave RiSe to the Multiplicity of Religions, (as this Gentleman obServes) is evident from the History of Jerohoam the Son of Nehat^ who made Ifrael to fin : For tho* in the Covenant made with him by the Prophet Shilonity he was to preServe the true Religion of God 5 yet, when he was once poIfeSs’d of the Kingdom of Ifraeh he argues to this PurpoSe; that if his People worship’d at Ideru-falem^ and had the Same Rites and Religion with the Tribe of Judah, they might in time unite again with that Tribe, and he be Sacrificed to Rehohoam. He therefore Set up the golden Calves at Bethel, and built the high Places,
and made Priests to officiate, of the lowest of
the
the People; thinking to Secure his Kingdom, when he had provided it with Gods of its own, and Rites different from thoSe instituted
bv tAoPs.
Of all' the WhimSeys (Said Jack^Dou-nright') of the Heathens, I find none but the Agyjg-tianSy who planted their Gods first, and then eat them. So that the Gods they adored in the Morning, at Noon made them a Sallad, or relish’d a Ragoust : And indeed, I think theSe Gods much more Savory Food, than the Papist Gods made of Flower and Water, and Something of a longer Duration ; for the Priest makes theSe Gods one half Hour, and de« vours them the next.
For my Part, (Said I) I am glad he left off where he did 3 for I am afraid if he had gone on, he would have made us Protestants a little Whimfical likewiSe in Religion 3 but we have reaSon to hope, that what he has Said will only reach a few of our People.

To Mrs. Catharine Eairwity near Do'very
Kent.
r
A Declaration of Lonje.
y^EAR Madam, I make no manner of doubt, but that you have obServ’d my Conduit So well, as to know that I am one of the Number of your Lovers ; but left I should be deceiv’d in that Opinion, and your want of that Knowledge should be a delay to my HappineSs; I venture now to give it under my Hand, that I love you better than Health blest with the Smiles of Fortune ; for thoSe, without your Smiles, could never give me a fincere HappineSs. I doubt not but you have been told So by many, and, if they Spoke the Sentiments of my Heart, with a great deal of Truth. But lince you have not yet made choice of any Candidate, I hope I may put in my Claim. You must not expeil from my Passion any of the Efforts of common Lovers ;
I shall not make So much as an Anagram upon you ; nor shall I tell you, that your Eyes are twin Stars, that your Face is the Sun, your Bo-Som Hills of Snow, or the like. I grant your Eyes diave a Light, which they diSperSe all around; but it is their own, and not borrow’d, and at the Same time dazzles our Eyes and inflames our Heart; in short, it is Such a Light, that no Star-gazer ever diScover’d in any of
the
i8)
the Planets or fix’d Stars ; it gives a preSent Comfort, and promiSes future Joys: Fine, full, black, rolling Eyes, replenish’d with Spirit in their Motion, have an irrefistible Power 3 and a Man would strive in vain to diSengage his Heart from them, if you thought it worth the keeping.
As your Eyes are much more agreeable Ob-jefts than the Stars, So is your whole Face than the Sun. The chief Benefit of the Sun is Light 3 and the principal Advantage of Light to me, is, that it shews me you. It diScovers Charms in your Face more enliv’ning to Flesh and Blood, than all his Beams. Ruddy Lips, Teeth Small, even, and of the Colour of Pearl; Cheeks, where the red and white are So finely mingled, are Such Beauties, as the old Greeks Fablers made the Gods come down from their Heaven to purSue the Love of Woman. As for your BoSom, I shou’d wrong it to call it a Rock of Snow 3 Snow could only give us the dead Colouring, which is heighten’d by Nature with a pleafing Warmth, which Titian himSelf could never expreSs.
To stop here, for to go further would be to follow Imagination into an unknown Country, which even that Imagination could never deScribe. Thus I love you, Madam, for your own Charms, without endeavouring to magnify them by Similes and Hyperboles 3 but it k, becauSe I think they cannot by Such be made greater than they are. If any one should not think this enough, let him but behold you and be convinc’d.
Well, from what I have Said it is plain, you are truly lovely, and therefore may very well
be
(ip)
be belov’d; but you will perhaps demand Some Proof that I do really love you, lince Words are but weak Arguments or a Man’s Sincerity in this Age: If I knew any Proof greater than what I am going to offer, I would not omit it; but the Surest Testimony of Love that I know, is Marriage; yes. Madam, I am ready to enter into the holy State of Matrimony with you, if you give your ConSent. I confeSs I once thought, he who built his Hap-pineSs on Woman, built on a very Sandy Foundation; . and that has thus long kept me from what I now Seek. If I was a Heretic So long, it was, becauSe no Woman before your-Self brought Such convincing Proofs of my Error; for now I plainly fee, that there is, that there can be no HappineSs, at least for me, without a Woman, that is, without you.
But you will Say, all that marry do not love. True, there are other vile Confiderations that produce Wedlock, as Money, Obedience to Parents, and the like. But none of theSe can reach my Cafe: My Estate and Wealth is too far above what injurious Fortune has left you MistreSs of; nor have you my Father or Mother to influence your Choice; So as you are the only Aim of my Defires, So it is wholly in your Power to gratify them. If you can think of any other Way or Means for me to convince you of my Sincerity in this Point, let me know it, and it shall Soon be embrac’d and perform’d, by,
Dear Madam,
Tour moji faithful and Jmcere Lover,

This is an Epistle of Some old Batchelor^ (Said the Barotj') and of one who puts fome Confidence in his Bags. And if MiSs Kitty have but half the Wit or Cunning, as She has Beauty in the Eye of old Amhrofe^ She may make a good Bargain, and fell herSelf at a very advantageous Rate.
However justifiable (assum’d tfie Chevalier') Amhrofe may be in his Motives to Marriage, 1 mean in Prudence, the Lady has certainly a most rational Call, a good Settlement; a large Jointure for a Small Fortune. Marriage stems to me like the Small Pox, a Distemper, that every one (generally Speaking) must have one time or other; but it proves most kindly when it comes in our younger Days. How happy this may prove I shall not pretend to determine, as knowing neither of the Parties ; but I have made it my Observation, that your old Batchelors, who have rail’d all their Lives at Women and Wedlock, generally make Such a Choice for themSelves at last, as may justify their former railing against the Sex.
Marriage, (Said I) as Chaucer has it, is like a Rabble Rout, when you are out you’d fain get in, and when you’re in you’d fain get out.
That is, (assum’d Douw/gk) ^ foolish Curiofity draws you in; and a painful Experience when you are in, makes you wish your-Self out. But Wishes, dear Knight, are in vain, ’tis Death, only Death, can figii your

LETTER III.
Eoolijh InquiettideSy or the falfe judgment which
is fafs*d on other Mens Ha^finefs.
To John Vaincare ESq; near Maidfione in
Kent.
Dear Jack,
WHEN shall I have a Letter from thee
without Some ridiculous Complaint ? "Whoever is happy, *tis plain you are not So; nay, that you cannot be So, as long as you give way to that uneaSy Temper, which you milcall the Spleen, which every Place will afford Fuel to. Why, my good Friend, if you will not be near any Blockhead of a good Estate, you must chqoSe fome more lucky Climate than ours for your Relidence. Now you have got a new Grievance, Jack. Neatjleather has bought an Estate near Maidfione^ and you cannot without Pain fee his Grandeur, and hear daily of his large and encrealing Poffestions; You fay, his Father was a poor Shoo-maker at the Bath^ and not being able to live by his original Trade, went to Barbadoes j where, by what Means you know not, he grew prodigioussy rich, and left Such an Estate to Jack..^ the Objed of your Indignation, (for I would not call it your Envy) that by good Husbandry he has
brought his Income to loooo L a Year. But
what
(“)
p
what if his Father had been a Cohhr^ I can See nothing in all this that ought to affe£l: you. Has his Gain rob’d you of any thing real? Has he made you Poorer, by his getting Riches ?
But you Say he’s a Blockhead, and deServes not to be So happy. Leave that to Providence, my Friend, the best Judge of its own Dispensations. Blame not an Industry you want, and yet what is So neceCSary to thrive in the World. If you are uneaSy in your Circumstances, take the right Road to improve them ; if you contemn the Means, prithee be not extravagantly conceited of your Merit, to expe6l: Miracles in your Behalf.
But why is he a Blockhead ? Why, he has not a Taste of Poetry; knows nothing of Ho-mer^ Htrgtl., Ovid. Spenfer^ Milton, and the like; but Spends all his instpid Life, without any of the fine and gay PleaSures that humane Nature is capable of, and which distinguishes a Man from a Brute. He is perpetually telling his Gold, toiling to heap up the shining Muck, for he knows not what, or whom. -
Well, my Friend, all this granted you, whst is become of your CauSe of Complaint? Would you change Conditions with him ? Be as fenSleSs, as dull as he, to have his Money, which you wou’d then perhaps enjoy no more than he does? You call him happy; I deny he is So, for a Fool cannot be nappy, it requires at least good SenSe. A MiSer cannot be So, for he is a perfe61: Slave to his Defires of Gain, and Solicitudes, and Fears of Lost.
Thanks
(23 )
Thanks to Heaven you have enough to enjoy all the Sweets of Life, and to keep off all Fears of its Anxiety from Fortune, if you would be pleaSed not to create Tortures to yourSelf. How many worthleSs Fops do I See paSs me every Day, lolling in their gilt Chariots, and four or five Footmen behind them I When I meet Tom Addle among them, famous for his Wealth and his Pride, and foolish Ambition, he moves nothing in me but my Laughter; tho*
I do not know a wretched Rogue, that is move undeferving than he is; there is no Creature he ever did the least good to, or Spoke well of j He Seems to me a Species by himSelf, as bad, if not worSe than the Devil. And he has been So great a Fool to declare it too; for upon Application made to him for an unfortunate Gentleman in great DistreSs, he Said, he did not in his Nature know what Compassion was 5 that if he Saw a Man lying on the Ground, on all the Racks of Pain and Want, and that his crossing the Way and giving him but Sixpence would make him a happy Man, he knew not So much Pity as to do it.
But then you Say, why is Such a Diabolical Monster happy, and abounding in all the Goods of Fortune ?
My Friend, there is nothing in which Men are more deceiv’d, than in the Judgment they make of other Mens HappineSs. They conclude from a magnificent Equipage, a great Estate, Coffers full of Money, Power, Dignities and Titles, that the Possessor of them is ; whereas HappineSs rarely, very rarely enters gilded Roofs. The Monster I have
men-
( h)
mentionM, Is of all Men the most miSerable, being every Day extended on the Racks of Avarice and Ambition ; of Ambition that can never be Satisfied. Tom’s Forefathers were too well known, to let even Money, that we would think could do all things, purchaSe him a Peerage, which he hath attempted with Some confiderable Expence, for his Avarice here, is SubServient to his Ambition; but his Punishment is thus strengthned by the loSs of his Money, and the disappointment of his aSpiring Hopes.
But my Letter will not afford me room for all I have to Say on this Head ; I shall conclude with two Instances, which will I hope Satisfy you ; one of a very unhappy Man, pof-fefs’d of the greatest Power and Riches; another of a poor Man perfectly happy, with very few of the Goods of Fortune.
Eiifshim of Neuremherg a learned	gives
us lilis Story. There was a Grandee of Sfaw^ (he does not mention his Name) who from Small Beginnings raiSed himSelf to the highest Posts both Military and Civil, that the Sfa-nijh Monarchy could bestow; and had sh entire an AScendant over the King, that he always defeated his Enemies Assaults, both private and publick, against him. No Place or Dignity was confer’d, but by his Interpofi-tion ; which brought all who had any Hopes, or PurSuits at Court, to an abSolute Dependance on him.
This brought him in incredible Riches, and in a few Years made him Master of one of the
largest Estates in Spain
Thus, were his two
darling
(^5)
darling Passions of Ambition and Avarice fully gratified, if it had been in the Nature of thoSe Passions ever to be Satisfied.
He was of a comely PerSonage, and a fresh Complexion 5 and in his Youth, had receiv’d innumerable Tokens of the Ladies Favours. He married into one of the best Families of that Nation, and his Wife was esteemed the most beautiful of her Sex; by her he had Several Daughters, and two Sons, all goodly, and promifing the greatest Comfort to the Parents.
Thus far nothing could in all Appearance be added to his HappineSs ; a noble Estate attained in the vigour of his Age, and So Settled a Power, that he wanted nothing but the Name of a Kin^. Yet, my Friend, let us now look into his Family, and his private Anxieties, and you will find there was little real CauSe to envy his Condition.
His Wife was beautiful, that alarmed hfi; Fears ; she was generous, that gave a perpetual Torture to his x\varice. The PromiSe of Posterity every Day decreas’d, all his Children dying in a Small Space, except one Son and one Daughter, and they only liv’d to make him more unhappy. He is next afHiisted with the Gout in a most violent Manner; and his Fears for his Bags gave him DiSquiet both Day and Night. He was by his Post obliged to keep a great Equipage, and every Servant he had, he imagin’d a Thief. This made him deny any one of them to lie in his dwelling HouSe, but lock’d them out every Night to their Quarters in the Out-houSes. He Scarce
C	indeed
( 2 5)
dndeed ventur’d his own Son and Daughter to
remain th ere.
Ills Daughter, now about fifteen, took a Fancy to one of her^Father’s Grooms, and privately Marries him, proves with Child, and was forc’d to acknowledse the whole Matter to her
-	O -
Father ; who Soon diSpatches the Groom into another World, which yet was not conceal’d from the Daughter j who coming into his Bed-cham’oec. Said, you were the instrument by whom Providence brought me to Life, and now you are the Instrument of my Death, So I owe you nothing:; with which Word stie stab’d herSelf to the Heart, and died that Moment. The Mother at the Sight run mad; the Father found Pangs enough in the Event, to furnisti his after Days with many Hours of MiSery, which was Sufficiently encreas’d by the fatabEnd of his Son. Which happen’d thus:
The young Man had but a poor Allowance from his Father, at least far short of what his pr) fuSe Temper requir’d; and therefore he agreed with Some of his Companions, to empty Some of the old Man’s Chests, and deliver the impriSon’d Gold, to Supply thoSe PleaSures which he thought his due. Having prepar’d all things in the best Manner he could, they got into the HouSe, and had remov’d a confi-derable quantity of Money ; the Gout holding the Father So firm a PriSoner, he could not come to the ReScue of his Bags. But great Frights have more than once remov’d Lamc-neSs for a v.;hile ; So getting to a Window by which the Robbers past, he shot among them, and by chance shot his own Son, all the reft
e Sc aping
(27)
eScaping with a confiderable Part of the Boo-
ty.
Morning came on, and the young Gentleman was found dead in the Court-Yard 5 and thus his Labours and continual Fatigues, all the Injustice he had been guilty of to heap Wealth, and engrofs Power, were lost; after a miserable Life, he died Childlels and in dif* race; and thus his very Name Scarce furviv’d im a Day.
Had Men, my Friend, judg’d by Appearance, this miserable Wretch had been call’d happy, and Providence as falssy, as impiousty arraign’d for his ProSperity.
I nave been So long upon this Suppos’d happy ’Man, that 1 have but very little room left for him who really was Ib. In short, I find my Example in a Country ParSon, of about four-fcore Pounds a Year; ParSon Upright he was call’d, from his erected Walk, never in the least stooping, as long as he liv’d. He de-ferv’d that Name as justly, for his vp Way of Living, in all his Aflions diSc" a true Cbrijiian.
He was bleSr’d with a handSome and v .u-ous Wife, and Several Children of .both ^exeSj. every way anSwerable to Such a Father and Mother; he educated all his Sons hinS elf, as his Wife did the Daughters; the Boys he fitted for Trades, the Girls she made the best of HouSewifes; and at their leiSure Hours, the Father gave them a little Light into Such Learning, as might be Serviceable to them ; as Grammar and History. Both the Sons and the Daughters were Mufically inclin’d, which
C z	they
ht
ering
(^8)
they took from both Parents 3 So that he. could entertain his Friends with an agreeable Con-Sort -of Vocal and Instrumental Mustc of his ' own begetting. His Children were, indeed, like Branches of Olive about his Table. The Daughters Accomplishments got them good Husbands, to whom they were Fortunes without Money, as they all acknowledg’d. The Sons were all put out to gainful Trades, in which they grew rich, with the Reputation of honest Men 3 and blest their Parents with a View of a happy Posterity. The Father and Mother, and the Children, were always amicable to one another, and equally dutiful to their Parents to their Deaths 3 which happen’d in a reverend old Age, he being FourScore and one, she Seventy 3 they died both on the Same Day, and were buried both in the Same Grave: So, that after a long Life, Spent lovingly together, without (parrels or Strife, Death itSelf leem’d not able to part them. They were attended to the Grave with a long train of Children and Grandchildren,and join’d by all the Parishioners, every one of whom thought he had lost a Father and Mother in them 3 for all his Time he kept ’em from Variance, and made up all Differences 3 always helping the Needy by his Interest, when he could not by his proper Stock 3 In short, he was their Phylician and Lawyer, as well as their Pastor, and lov’d them 10 well, that he would never change his Cure for one more beneficial; and So liv’d happily, and died uni-verSally belov’d and lamented.
I fancy you would chooSe rather to be this poor Country ParSon, with fourScore Pounds a Year,
than
(29)
than the SpA>uLj Graadee beSore mention’d, with all his Power and Wealth.
I wish w’hat I have Said, may cure you of your trouMeSome Spleen, as you cull it, and. teach you to mind the fixing your own Slappi-neSs, without fretting at that of* others ; and to judge no more by Appearance, which is too apt to deceive us. TSheSe are the fincere Wishes oS

But meth!nks*(purSu’d Doavnriyht) Mr. Care-lefs should have given us a Definition of Happinels, and then we should with more eaSe have decided that Point. I think it is a Sound Mind in a Sound Body, to have no Defires beyond our reach, and to be fully Satisfied with our preSent Condition.
At that rate, (concluded I) the Number of the Happy, as well as Eleff, is but very Small.

My old Friend fttjiice Nimis,
"'yL O U may perhaps be Surpriz’d at a Letter from me after fo long a Silence; but being last Week at Canterbury in a public Room, I heard your Name, and your Condu6l: made very free with by a couple of young Sparks, who, were pasting that Way towards France, in order to make themfelves more finish’d Coxcombs than they were. I confeSs, that their DiScourSe rous’d that old Friendship I had profeSs’d for you, to examine a little nicely into the CauSe of their Rancour against you, in order, if I could, to vindicate your Reputation from their Afperfions; and was not dissatisfied to find, that they were fo angry with you meerly be-' caufe you were justly Zealous in the Execution of your Office, which too many of your Bench have generally fufficiently neglefled; which I thought in Justice fb far from a Reproach , that it Seemed the higliest PraiSe they could give you.

( 3' )
King JKilliam, in a ConverSation with a Nobleman of my Acquaintance, told him^ that the Laws of England were in themSelves excellent, nay, perhaps more excellent than thofe of any of our Neighbours ; that the Legistature had taken care to provide against all the Evils incident to humane Societies, but that there Seem’d a general RemiSneSs in the Execution of them, which render’d them of little or no Effe£l:; Some being for excufing a Criminal. becauSe a Friend or Relation, others for Money, So that thoSe only Suffer’d, who had neither Friends nor Money; but could we once gain Such a Set of Justices as my Friend Nimby who would have no regard to private Ties, Parties, or Bribes, this Infamy of our Nation would Soon be remov’d.
This I urg’d So home to the young Gentlemen, that they had only this to Siy, that Se-rity was indeed necessary in a Magistrate, and that Execution was truly the Life of the Laws, which without that are a meer Speculation of no manner of uSe to the Publick ; but that then this Zeal should be against all

Crimes, and not direSied only against one, which is So grafted in Nature, that it is a meer Jest to aim at the extinguishing of it s That all your Rig«ur only reach’d the poor Whores, which your ProSecutions only harden’d, and made ten times more wicked than they were before; and that only for the Sake a Company of Scoundrel RaScals, call’d Reforming Constables, and their Followers the Informers : That it was not very likely that the Devil shouldipromote Virtue.

When they had Said this, th^ call’d for their HorSes and purSued their Journey, but left me with a ReSolution of Writing to you on this Subject; of which 1 shall give you my Judgment.
Immorality is a very popular Pretence, to cover A6Iions which proceed from a CauSe more infamous than thoSe Immoralities Some Men are So loud against.
It is now near thirty Tears, stnce thisNoife of the Society for the Reformation of Manners was rais’d, and I wou’d fain know what Pro-greSs it has made; is there one Whore or Bawd the leSs for all they have clone ? They have indeed publish’d a large Catalogue of the Names of theSe two Sorts of Wretches ; they have carted half a dozen Bawds, and whipt Some Score of poor Harlots in Bnde'e.el, whence they have come So far from being reform’d, that they were ten times more imp»< dent and abandon’d than before : And all th’s while none Suffer’d in this CaSe, but Such as could not bribe the Informers either with their PerSons or their Money, the Price of their Whoredoms. Many civil Women were abus’d by them, and great Evils brought on Families by the Villains that were employ’d in this pious Work. To repeat the Particulars would Swell to a Volume; I shall mention but two or three. A modest young Woman was follow’d by one of thele Fellows, tho’ attended at a distance by more of the Gang; he tempted her all he could t© get her to go into a Tavern with him, but in vain; and yet she could not shake him off, till coming near to an Alehoufe where
there

(33)
there was a Bench at the Door, he delired her to rid herSelf of him, by fitting down there in the Street, and sharing of one Pot of Ale; the Terms she thought innocent enough, and fat down ; by that time she had pledg’d him, the others came up and Seiz’d her for being pick’d up in the Street, and had carried her off, but that one drinking by, and hearing the Matter, interpos’d, and being a Lawyer, So frighten’d the Informers,, that they were glad to make off. But had k not been for. this Accident, the Poor Woman wou’d have been drag’d to Brideu-ef and So ruin’d, having a Husband too Subjefl to JealouSy.
There was a Lady of my Acquaintance^ who. was by the mistake of the Coachmam carried to a Tavern of an ill Reputation, which stood just by that to which she dire6l:ed him and having Sent for a Gentleman of her Acquaintance, of whom she was to receive ten-Pounds; (Money Sav’d unknown' to, her HuS-band) they had not been long enough together' to drink two Glaffes of Wine,' but in came the Reforming Constable and his Gang, who carries them before a certain Justice,, who Sent her to Tuttle Fields Bridev.-el; and tho’ the Gentleman got her out as loon in the Morning as he could, the Husband heard of it, and Sent to her not to come home any more ; nor h is. me ever liv’d with him fince, tho’ she has ob* lig’d him by the Means of DoUors-Commons to allow her a PAaintenance,
Had not this Lady had Friends, she must hive starv’d by the Folly (not to call it worSe)
y
of the JuSc'ice of the Peace. I shall oaly adi

Q

C 34 )
one Instance more, becaule I Icnew one ofi the PerSons concern’d, who told it me himSelf.
Three Sober and elderly Citizens one Sunday went to the other end of the Town, one of them was oblig’d to call at a certain Place, and destr’d the other two to step into the Cof-fee-HouSe and wait his Return. They call’d for Coffee, but there was nothing to be had but Brandy ; they call’d for half a Quartern, the Woman brought a (Hartern, and then Soon came in two or three Informers with a Constable, with whom while the Citizens were arguing, their Friend return’d, who being a brisk Man, demanded of the Constable to carry them before a Justice, and with them her whom they call’d a Bawd: The Reformers told them it would be Scandalous to have it known, that two Such grave Gentlemen should be taken in a Bawdy-HouSe; that therefore they had better give Something to the Poor of the Parish by their Hands, and go their Ways. They reply’d, they were not afraid of that Matter, and So oblig’d them to go and carry Madam wdth them.
Being come before the Justice, he began to harangue them with the shame of theFa<st, &^c. Why, Sir, do you know this to be a Bawdy-HouSe? Yes marry do I, Said the Justice, the Woman is an old (Offender. How Sir, affum’d they, and have you permitted a known Baw-dy-HouSe to be kept open, to betray ignorant People like us into a Premunire ? But Sir, we will give you in Bail, and shall examine whether your Commission will warrant your Con-
dust in this Affair. The Justice was affrighted
(35)
ed with their Relolution, and came to this Agreement, that the Constable should ask their Pardon,and that the Sign should be pull’d down the next Day, which my Friend assur’d me was done. Now had theSe Gentlemen been timorous, they had been thus betrayed to pay Money Sor the Roguery of'thoSe who were to receive it.
This Stir against the Whores, on Account of Immorality.^ puts me in mind of the Mob in the Oedifm or Dryden and Xef, who thought there was no Sin but Murder; as if there were none immoral but a Common-Whore. But indeed, this is Such a Sort of Immorality^ that eafily furnishes the Tongues of the worst of Men with a canting Clamour, by which they gain the Reputation of Saints ; and thoSe who Scarce believe in God, with that of the most: Religious: Oh the Immorality and Profhanenefs of the Age ! They cry out, while they devour Widows and Orphans, without the least Check from their ConSciences; who can oppreSs the Poor, Squeeze the Necessitous, and ruin Families, and yet paSs for Saints, as if their Actions were not tar more detrimentally immo-ral, than thoSe of a Common-Whore. Plence it is plain, that all this is but a canting Hypo-criSy, to palm upon the World a Company of Devils, for no leSs than the Upright and the Godly. ,	_
This is likewiSe a meet fantastical Chimera.^ a plain Bon QAxotiJm, encountring Windmills, or making a monstrous Bustle to no manner of PurpoSe: To effefl: that in this Nation, which never was here, or in any other Coun-^ try in the World; and I dare assert, never
C 6	will
(30
will be. We find that when the World was not So Populous as at preSent, the Patriarch lay with one he found by the Way fide, which was the Station of thoSe Mercenaries in that Part of the Wshrld. where they pick’d up their Sparks. ’Tis true, she prov’d to be his Daughter in Law, but he thought her one oS the Comnaon 3 which shows that there were Such, even thus early in the World. My dear Friend Nirnd, when thou, or any of thy Fraternity of Whore-Hunters, will show me any Capital! in the UniverSe without this Cattle 3 or, when you’ll prove that you have lefSen’d'the Number of any in London^ but one Whore, 1 will agree that there is firm Ground for your Zeal 3 but till then, 1 must think you are all fet to work by other Motives than Religion 3 and that all you have done or shall do in this kind, is only to multiply Sin, obliging, by this new Tax upon them, the poor Wretches to ex-poSe their Bodies the more frec[uently and the more deSperately, to feed the very Scum of Mankind, the Reformers of Manners.
?ylethinks you might find Some more noble PurSuits for So acHve a Zeal. Step into the Taverns, and destroy all their Sophistical Brewings, that his Majesty’s good Subjeffs may not be poiSon’d in their Mirth and good Fellowship. The CenSors of the College of Phyficiatis have a Right to inSpcCl the Apothecaries Shops, and burn or throw, away the decay’d or bad Drugs 3 and why should the Vinthers' be exempt from as neceffary a Scrutiny ? And who more fit for that Oshce than
a Mid'
(37)
t
a hiiddlefex Justice? Or you might Scatter the
Sharpers, the Gamesters, and Gaming HouSes, where So many are daily undone. But it is pleaSant enougffto obServe, that when the wiSe City put down the Drolls of Banbolomen--Fair^ the Kafihag.Shops and Gaming-Tables were Suffer’d to ujaSeatonable Hours in the Night.
IS your Zeal is more Heroic, go to Exchange-Alley and diSperSe the Stock.Dbbers, that Trading Sort of Gaming, where ThouSands are every Year over-reach’d and undone by cunning Knaves, and tricking Sharpers.
If you will be Patriots, look, into the Pri-Sons, See what Inhumanity and Barbarities are us’d to the Unfortunate; how many are confin’d in the MarjJjalfea., and Some other By-Pri-Sons, for half a (Srown ; and undergo for a Misfortune, more intolerable Punishments , than the mxOst criminal Offenders in the most rigorous Countries in the World.
I might Send you* to Gi'een'n-tch-Hofpital.^ to take a Survey of the Condition of the poorfuperan-nuated and maimed Seamen, by that to diScover how plentifully they are provided for, and how few Land-Lubbers are admitted to feed upon the Tarpaulin Foundation; but that'perhaps may be out of your JuriSdiffion. I shall conclude my long Letter, with the Advice of a Friend : Do not fignalize yourfelf as the Don Quixote of Hklts’’s-AaU do your Duty justly, that is, impartially, that is, be most Severe on the most criminal Immoralities ; and Spend not your very a^live Life in PurSuits, tha,t are of no more ConSequence than if you had lain still

Your old Bottle Companion and Ftnend^

Mr. Tronjide (Said the Brfro;?,) has expreSs’d fome Fellow-feeling for the poor Pains-takers of the Hundreds of Drury.
Let him have a Fellow-feeling for whom he will, (affum’d the Chevalier') he is perfectly just in his Sentiments; for I think there can be nothing more evident, than that HypocriSy Set this new Work of Reformation on Foot, with much NoiSe to purSue what can never be attain’d.
At least, (Said Dotvnright) by their Methods, for the Devil’s Imps are but odd Apostles for the CauSe of God.
True, my Friend john, (concluded I) it is more the BustneSs of the Clergy to effefl: it by Prayer, good Exhortations and a bright Example.

HO’ it is Some Time fince you diSmiSs’d me your Service; yet being oblig’d to stay a Sew Days at Canterbury in my way to France, I there heard that you are now going to enter the holy State of Matrimony with a future Do6Ior of Phylick, for from your PurSe he waits to take his Degree. This is the Occa-ston of my preSent Writing, to shew, that you have made the worst Choice, in chooling a Murderer before a Gamejier, (or as you ar^ pleas’d to call us) Sharper, the much more innocent and leSs criminal PerSon ; we only strip a rich Fool, and ,bring him to Sobriety and Repentance, which the Rogue otherwile would never have thought of; the young
Dostor of Phystck, by first being a Retainer
of

of two or three topping Apothecaries, and la-tisfying their Avarice with chargeable Prescriptions, without regard to the Health or the Pocket of the Patient^ m:ty, Vilce David, in a few Years kill his ten N^houSind, and So get into BufineSs as they call it.
Mrs. Tahitha^ I destre you would look back on all that has paSs’d between us lince 1 first purSu’d you in the Street, from our wicked end of the Town, to your more godly Abode; and then you will recollefl how agreeable you thought Mr. Bemigard on So little an Acquaintance, and how you admitted him into your Father’s Tabernacle of RighteouSnefs, representing me as a most Sober and accomplish’d PerSon to old Obadiah-y who, upon his virtuous Daughter’s Charadler, gave me free EgreSs and RegreSs, till the Devil, I believe loth to loSe his Hopes of me, made the DiScovery to you that my Name was Coggdie.^ and not Bemigard^ a Knight of the Box and Dice, and no Gentleman of an Estate; tho’ indeed I only assur’d you that I was a Man of Fortune, and truly, for on her blind Ladyship, and my industrious Elbow,^ I bear the Part and Appearance of a Gentleman in So agreeable a Manner, that more than Mrs. Tabitha have thought me a very pretty Fellow. Rut indeed I was not So fond of my Profession, but that I had'rather have enjoy’d the Money your Father went to the Devil for, than to go to the old Gentleman in Black, for what my Industry might find a lucky Hit to obtain. But fince it is So,. I am Sure of Some of Mrs. Tabithats Friends and Relations
for my Companions.
But
1 «
( 41 )
But why are you So averSe to a Gamefier ? I mean one who lives hy Gam'mgf. Oh! it is an Abomination, down right Cheating, and the living on the Ruin of Families. Well Mrs.	and what do you thin-fc of dear
Fapa ? do you imagine that he got- all his Wealth honestly by Selling of Belts ? If he had no more than Honesty would have given him, I had never thought of addressing his Daughter; no, no, first, he got by the oppressing the poor Workmen, whoSe Sweat, and whofe Toil and Labour fill’d his Pocket, whilst their own Families starv’d ; So the difference between-hina and me, is, what I get I force from the Rich*, and fend them away empty; but he Squeezes the poor Labourer, and makes a hundred Families miferable to fill his Coffers.
This holds good of all your thriving Shopkeepers and' Traders who employ the Poor, whom they are Sure to keep always in that Number, So that ObaMah is not the only Rog-ue in the City.
Then what think you of Exchange-Alley ?' That Groom Porters, as I may call it,, of City Gaming: Has not thy honest Father play’d’ many a Game there, thrown many a merry Main of the Bear-skin, to fill his own Pockets, and empty thoSe of his lefs cautious Neighbour ? All the Gamesters and Sharpers in Town are nothing to the Gentlemen-of that Alley ; they are but meer Dealers in the Retalc of MiSchief and Ruin, in which the Stock-Jobber deals by WholeSale.
So
( 4^ ),
So much for the City— But v/hat think. you of the Lawyers,. thoSe ConServators of our Rights and Liberties ? The Pra£i;ice of Law,, their Market, and they have no manner of regard to Right or Wrong, but plead the worft GauSe- for a Fee,, and oppreSs the best which is destitute of Money enough to run the Gauntlet of all their Hearings and Rehearings, Writs of Error, Common-Law, Kings-Bench,
and above all Chancery^ by which the Lawr yers Swallow the Estates contended for, and we Fools that employed them, leave off Beggars. So is your Liberty and Properties guarded, and So dispos’d of by Mercenary Tongues.
I will Say nothing of the Divines,. they are the common Topick of Railery, and few of them get Estates as ever I could find!
Upon, the whole, Sweet Mrs. Tabitha, I, think it will appear, that you have reJested the most honest Profession that a Man can get a great deal of Money by, to chooSe the worst; for of all,, the Phystcian is So much the worst, as Mens Lives are what he deals in ; all other Cheats are only in the Goods of Fortune : And you may remember that old Satan (who was no Fool) obServ’d, So long ago aS‘ the .Dime of Joh.^_ That a Man u'illfart ivith ad. rather than 'with hif Liji y and yet, fo many part with that every Day for the Benefit of the Phyficians, that the Difeafe call’d the Dostor Sweeps Men away more, than all the other.' Distempers in.the Bills of Mortality.
So
(43)
So, Sweet Mrs. Tabuha^ much good may it do you with your Galen and Paraceljm^ for I have fill’d my Paper, and So adieu;.
Dear Mrs. Tabitha,
Yours^

A good whimfical Sort of a Letter (Said I) the Sharper rambles agreeably enough; And with too much Truth (affum’d Downright') for I am afraid there are few Estates got with that Honesty and Integrity, that the Severity of Religion requires. He has omitted one way of growing Rich, (purSu’d the Chevalier) much-more criminal in my Opinion,, than any. of theSe3 and that is, Estates got by the' where the Nation is the Da^e to private Gain 3 and he that has amaSs’d great Wealth together by the Government enjoys it, and. tranSmits the Spoils of Thoufands to a worth-leSs Posterity. For Small Thieves are bang’d, but the great Robbers triumph in .their Rogueries.
Nay, (Said the- Baron) the Sharper has been' modest in his own Defence, for we have heard of Men of Dignity, who have not diSdain’^d'" being of their Fraternity ; and it is So modish . an Employ, that it can bring the Footman from the Coach Tail to his Lord’s Table, and Sometimes to his Lady’s Bed.
Befides, (reSum’dI) the Sharper ht^s this Advantage of all the other Money-Hunters, the
Wretches
/
(
Wretches he makes are all Voluntiers, for no Man is forc’d to be a BuhhLe ; he is So out of Choice, and not out of Necessity. True, (pur^ Su’d the Chevalier) whilst all the poor Labourers in the other State are compelled to it, by being oblig’d to Serve their Oppresstrs Screven that miserable Livelihood they get under them.
Another Advantage (Said the Bami) the Gamester has is, that by what he does, he in-fliSls a Punishment on the most d'estruSbve Vice of humane Nature, Avadure^ which has ruin’d So many Kingdoms and Commonwealths ;.for the most arrant Bubble that is, becomes lo by a Dissatisfadlion with what he has, and a Dessre of more.
And yet (concluded DoroKright') the Sharper gains no great Advantage in Esteem or Honesty, and Glory and Reputation, by being the Executioner of this Punishment, Executioners of all Punishments being detested, witneSs the Hangman and the- Devil, the two great Executioners of this World and the next.

SINCE I Saw you, I have taken a Trip to France^ not to Paris I aSSure you, I had no Call to improve mySelf [in Dancing : I went no further than Calais^ and that about BulineSs, which held me there above a Month; in which time I got acquainted with a merry Fellow, that us’d to drink with me at the Fille de Londres^ a new Convert^ as they call them ; but on our Conversation I found that he was a Protestant in his Opinion still, though he outwardly conform’d to Save his Bacon, that is, his little Estate, and himSelf from the Gallies.
Monfieur Antoin (for that was his NameJ) had a curious Colleflion of Papers, which he communicated to few but Englijh^ in whom he had Some Confidence, among which was this Letter, the Transsation of which I here fend you. That it is genuine, I cannot Say, having no other Voucher but the Gentleman who permitted me to tranScribe it; but this I can Say , that it contains nothing but the real Principles of Pofery ^ it is Said to be written by

My dear Comfere^^
The BuIineSs of this Epistle relates more to honestD^i^^^^ than to you, and therefore I de--stre you to show him my Letter if he be with you still, and not tript over to that Sink of He-reSy England. I have often been afraid that his Conversation with thoSe Hereticks here in their Journeys to and from Paris, wou’d Some time or other rob me of the most agreeable Companion ;I ever had in my Life ; For “ifaques has a great many engaging (i^alities, as well as Frailties. ’Tis true, he loves a Drah as well as an Englifi* man, and his Bottle as much as a German 5 but ithen he has the Gaiety of a true Frenchman, is all Spirit, Life and Mirth.
He is very much afraid ©f going to the De-wil j and therefore to Secure himSelf on that fide, he generally has Some Priest for a Night-'Companion; for drunk or lober he will not go 'to Bed without AbSolution, So that he evens his Spiritual Accounts every Night, and wipes Tiut all the Scores of the Day by a Noilurnal Sacrament: Nor does he much care for Purgatory, and therefore lays by a Stock for Indulgences and Masses whenever he dies.
I have often told him, that he need not be sh strupulous as long as he is in the BoSom of the Roman Catholick Church ; for it is Said, Qa<£~
rite trrimum Regnum Dei, Qp hac omnia adiidentur voUs ; that i s, Seet{, fir (I the Kingdom of God, and all Pings are la'veful to you : Now his plain, the ^Kingdom of God is the Holy Catholick Roman
Apostoliok
( 47 )
istpostolick Church; be obedient to her Precepts, obey her Priests, and all things are lawful to,.you that are Sins in the Hereticks, whoSe best and most pious Actions are no leSs. This is a Comfort he will be entirely depriv’d of if he .turn Heretick. 1 confeSs that ibme of them have lately pretended to AbSolution in the highest SenSe it can be understood, viz., that there is no Condition req^uir’d in the Penitent, but the Sins are forgiven meerly by the Power of being pronounced by the Priest But to me they Seem to a£l on a very weak Bottom, for that Power was only given to Priests of the true Succestion, for no others have the Mark that This was Said to them as well as to the Apostles, mean Miracles : Whereas every	Catho-
lick Priest, every ©ay he Says MaSs, performs a great Miracle, for he changes a Bit of Bread, ^or Wafer, into the Crod who made Heaven and 'Earth ; and then to become entire all Divine himSelf, he ta!kes his Breakfast of this God : 1 verily believe there is Scarce a Particle about me but has proceeded from this Heavenly ^eti-taculum; for 1 believe I may have made and eaten above two thouSand Gods of the larger Size fince I have been In Priest’s Orders.
Put therefore my Friend ^ques in mind of •theSe Comforts and Advantages he has by being in the Church into which he was born and christen’d ; for sh he enjoys a Heaven both here and hereafter ; whereas the Hereticks are in Pain and Solicitudes here, and will be damn’d hereafter. Adieu.

Methought I Sound mySelf at the Foot of a very high Mountain, which overlook’d all Eu. robe, and which 1 was oblig’d to aScend and pafs in the Way I was to go ; when I came to Wards the Top, I was entertain’d with a hundred delightful ProSpedls all round me, which, whilft I Was taking a View of, methought I heard a very loud Laughter ; yet not Such a Laughter as proceeds from PleaSure, but from Indignation, and triumphant Malice : It was not therefore pleafing to the Ear, nor delightful to the Heart, in So vast a Solitude I then was palling ; no, it rather struck me with Horror, and my Flesh all trembled ; my Hair stood erested as in the greatest Fright, and my whole Com-posttion being shock’d, I was apprehenstve of Some ill Adventure that threatned me.
Turning mySelf to the North-east, from whence the Sound Seem’d to come, I Saw the ghastly Appearance of Sin, Death, and the IF 'Oil. Sin and Death went with an incredible SwiftneSs, each holding one end of a Net ofi prodigious LargeneSs, So that in its Extent it cover’d whole Nations ; the Nature of the Meshes of this Net were Such, that thoSe who were ordain’d to a longer Life broke through them, whereas the rest were in a Minute all dead on the Spot.
' Satan, as Soon as it was fall’n, hasted to^he Quarry to See what was caught ; on his examining of which, he fell into th^Se loud Fits of Laughter.
I was in too great a Consternation to mind much what was done in the North-east of En-

Now therefore the Net is thrown over part
of Italy^ France^ Spain^ and England.
Well, Father, Said Sin to Satan., whom have we taken at this Draught ? Ho, ho, ho 1 reply’d the Devil, with his horrible Laugh, Here are two old rich Cardinals, that have amaSs’d vast TreaSure in hopes that the next Sede Fa-cante they might be able to bribe the Conclave to Set them in the infallible Chair, though one was FourScore and upwards, the other Seventy eight: Not that they believ’d that the Poffel-fion of the Triple Crown wou’d bring them any other Infallibility than Wealth, and the Power of making their Scoundrel Relations Princes-In all the vast Variety of Beings which I have been able to diScover thro’ the vast ExpanSe, I have not met with So very filly an Animal as that of Man, vain in his Defires, and crooked in his CounSels. ReaSon indeed he boasts'of, and has Such an invaluable Jewel, but how Seldom does he conSult it in any of his PurSuits ? Avarice is his Guide, and heaping vast Stores of Silver and Gold together. Seems his Happi-neSs, but for what? To enjoy it? No, the thriving Tribes have nothing leSs in their Heads : They all know well enough that they have but a little time to live at the longest, and yet they aft as if they were to dwell here for ever:

The End of their Creation few ever think of, or believe, as Suppofing no Life after this 3 a Doffrine that has brought me many a million •of Souls, and is So well establish’d now, that I have no great need to fear that Virtue and true Religion will ever Spoil my Markets.
Ho, ho, ho, ho, ho, ho, ho! Death and Sin hearing the Devil laugh So long and So loud, enquir’d the CauSe ; but Satan not direclly minding them, addreSs’d himSelf to the Dead; Ho, ho! whom have we here, the Immortal Man] What have thy Flatterers deceiv’d thee, and art thou too fall’n into the common Rubbish?
Ho, ho ! See how his Idolaters run from him holding their NoSes! Why, you Scoundrel Dogs, what can your Monarch stink now he’s dead, who just now Spread nothing but Perfumes a-round him ? Why, So it is, my Children—Men who fell fiat to the Ground to the living Prince, wou’d not harbour him in their HouSes when
dead: My Son and GrandSon Death^ thou art a strange MetamorphoSer of things in this World.
T'his Piece of Clay, when warm, had power to destroy whole Nations, and he was indeed myjust Representative j not leSs than Forty millions have bled for his Glory, belides the millions that are left to a miSerable Life. Here!
here a Troop of my Imps convey him to Nero^ Helioyahalus,, and the rest of the great Destroyers of Mankind ; let him be well attended to my Retrions, where he will have time to refiest, that the way for a King to aScend the Stars, is to be the PreServer of Men, and not the Destroyer j he has choSen the Lot that is fall’n to
him,

( 53 )
him, and now he finds that the Soul Is immortal.
At which I thought I Saw a Troop of Devils convey the unhappy Soul away witliTerrors not to be expreSs’d.
Ha ! Monfieur Pons^ what are you So faithful as to attend your Master (continu’d Satan) What, and to the Same Place too ? What, cou’d not you fiddle yourSelf np to Heaven ? Whar, Said Death, was he a Fidler ? No, no, reply’d the Devil, a much more worthleSs Creature, he kept a whole Band of Fidlers and Singers at vast Expence, who Sung and play’d to him all the Week, and on Sundays to God Almighty in a Chapel of his own building : For he Set up for a great Zealot for the worst of the Clergy, call’d the JeSuits. He got vast Riches in paying the King’s numerous Armies, and Squander’d it in this manner , fori can’t find that he ever did one good or generous AfUon in his whole Life : But by his Death now he has eScaped a Punishment here, which many of the Pillagers of the Publick will meet with in a little time.
Ho, ho, ho ! what, Madam Ogle, are you come at last ? Had you no Arts to charm Death? It is well he has no Eyes, and is not a Man 5 he cou’d not elSe have eScap’d your Snares, to which the Wife and the Valiant fell constant Viflims : What must you come to my share at last ? Why, you were more constant at Church than the Priest, though he got by it; nay, you got too ; you got what you fought,new Lovers, show’d your fine Cloaths, cast round the wanton Glances, that gave Hopes to every one, and
D $	by

by that means made what choice you pleas’d. But Beauty, as well as Valour, must yield whea Death Summons.
f
Oh ! here is a modern StateSman ; he wasori-
\
ginally a little Monsseur Advocate of Bretagne, •where his Father and Family liv’d tolerably well, and made a Figure among the Country Gentry ; but this Wretch being very Sanguine, and full of Confidence in his tricking Genius, made his way to Court, where when either ill or weak Princes reign, there is great room for the Rife of the WorthleSs; there by Tricks he got into Posts, and So put himSelf on the World jor a profound Politician or StateSman : For though there be nothing wanting to govern a People but good SenSe and Honesty, yet when Knaves get into Power, and do unwarrantable Things, they cover them under the Name of Arcana of State: And by this means the modern Times have excluded true WiSdom, Knowledge, Virtue, Hondur, and the like, from the Governing Part of Mankind, though now and then a great Genius forces itSelf into Power, to the Confufion of the Trickjiers.
But how now great Statefman ! never a Trick to put on Death? you put him off indeed a little while by one, yet you fee we have got you at last 3 here, away with him to the Den of Attornies, Solicitors, Prodlors, Petty-fbggers, who will Scarce let the Devils alone, often trying to Set them together by the ears, not knowing that Devils fall not out with De-, nor persecute one another ; no, no, we have BufineSs, Sport, and Employment enough to hunt Men,

Ho! ho! old Fool, Sir, are you come too? This now was an overgrown Alderman, and has left behind him four hundred thouSand Pounds for his Heirs to rejoice with, that he is come to me. He originally Set oat from the North on Foot, was entertain’d by a rich Citizen to clean his Servants Shoes, and So advanc’d from Post to Post, till his Master took him Apprentice, and then Partner; but at last: he gave his helping Hand in a grateful Return to ruin his Master, and make him die a Beggar ; who had taken him from Beggary, and made him capable of being a Lord-Mayor. But all
this would not do, here we have him, without one good Deed to plead in his Favour.
Alas! poor Seven and Eleven, have you thrown out? What you, who from a kick’d Bully, and bilking of Coaches, arriv’d by the Box and Dice to 70000 f. and So became a Man of Figure, and Companion for Lords? no Trick to bilk Death and the Devil ? no, no, the only Trick there, was quite out of your Taste, Firtue and Religion.
Who have we here ? All-love the Atheist ? for So they call’d thee; but Such Atheists ner ver came to me. His Love to Mankind was general, his Life was a perpetual Scene of good Astions, the Milerable were Sure of his Help, let their Opinions be what they would ; yet could he not eScape the Imputation of an Heretic by Some, and an Atheist by others, who were really themSelves what they called him out of Envy ; See, he is Sneaking away to Heaven by himSelf, while all that Troop of his Acquaintance tak-e up their Lodging with me.

In my Opinion, (Said the Baron) this Visson needs no Interpretation, the Lesson it teaches, is too plain to need a Comment. But I can’t endure (Said I) that the Devil should be allow’d to Speak So much Truth. Phool Phoo! (assum’d the Chevalier) the Devil may be allow’d to Speak his Thoughts truly among his own Tribe, he need only lie to Man, and that too, only when a Lie will do his Buli-neSs better than Truth. What he is made to utter here, is a fatal Truth, that few or none of Mankind apply themlelves to distinguiUi, the real from the appearing Good, which is the Caufe of all our MiSerics here and hereafter.

FerSon was Sufficiently contemptible, sh liis Fortune contributed to. give himi the Name of Scmhy Bob^ and made him the Laughter,, and the Footbal of the whole Parish ; till his great Soul, unable to bear theSe daily Indignities any longer, and his good Mother being dead, he was reSolv’d to Seek his Fortune in Some more favour.able Climate, and So Set forward and Beg’d his way to London,
He was of a dwarfish Size, his Complexion tawny, his Hair black and greeSy, his Legs Seem’d Set on the wrong End upward ; his Body was strait enough, and strongly made to fit him for Labour, had not his natural Lazi-neSs render’d him very unaftive ; all together he made in the Eye of the whole Village, young and old, a most ridiculous and deSpicable Figure. However Fortune thought better of him, and raiSed him from vS'cm^jy Bo^, to Rokn ScrAy ESq; When he was first entertain’d, he was only admitted to lie in the Stable, litter’d with the Horfes: thence he sot into the Kitch-en, and in the nature of a Scullion got Warmth, and now and then a good bit of Victuals to eat. How long he remain’d in this Post I have not learn’d; but the next Point of his Advancement we find in a Lady’s HouSe not far from Chifivick. in Middlefex^ and there he got in a Livery, made the Fires for the Maids, did their Errands, and Sometimes was admitted to go behind his Lady’s Coacli when she took the Air.
He made his Lady’s Fire So long in her •Apartment, that he kindled a Fire in her Heart unknovvn to himSelf or his Fellow Ser-

vants. He was first order’d a new Livery, and care taken to keep him a little clean. When one Day the Coach was order’d to carry his Lady abroad, and no other Lacquey to attend her but himSelf, the Coachman was bid to drive to CbiJuFk Church, where while she waited in her Coach, Bob was Sent to fetch the ParSon to her ; who being come, she alighted and went in with him and Bob, and pulling out a Licence gave it the ParSon, and told him she had made choice of him to perform the Ceremony of her Marriage ; the ParSon assur’d her he was ready to do his' Ossice, but he Saw no Husband, but Suppos’d he was not yet come; yes, reverend Sir, Said she, this is the Man I intend to make my Husband, taking Bob by the Hand. He little dreaming of this strange Revolution of Fortune, and full of ConSufion, made his Lady many Bows; the ParSon refus’d to marry her fb much beneath herSelf; in short, she told him she had ten Guineas in her Hand for him, and the Licence was Sufficient Authority for his performing his Office, which if he refus’d. Some other Minister should do it, fince she was fully determin’d to have it done that very Day. The good ParSon was unable to refist the Gold and the Lady’s Commands, and So quickly join’d Bob and his Lady in the holy Bands of Matrimony: The Lady went into the Coach, and Bob as he came thitlier behind it, and So got home Some time before Dinner. Boh went up with Madam, nenleffing his uSual duty of kindling the Fire in the Parlour, which occafion’d him Some Reproaches from the HouSe-Maid 5 but her I.ady told her, she

might do it herSelf, or make Some other" perform that Office, fince Bob was othervviSe employ’d. The Maid being gone, Madam gave him a Key, and bid him open Such a Clofet, and he would find a Suit of Cloaths that would fit him, and Linnen anSwerable, ordering him to dreSs himSelf from Head to Foot now, like her Husband. Bob with Joy put her Commands in Execution, and was got rea-dv bv Dinner time to fit down at Table with
J	^
his SpouSe, to the Surprize and Amazement of the whole Family.
Bob behav’d himSelf with great Moderation in his new Fortune, and none of his Fellow Servants had cauSe to complain of his Pride or InSolence. He made a very loving Husband, and his Lady grew fondpr-and fonder of him.
This Exaltation of Scruby Bob. to Robert Sern-
^ *
by ESq; had not extinguish’d the Memory of our Village, where he first Saw Light; but he found a great Inclination to make it a Vi-fit, either out of that natural Love we all bear to our Places of Birth, or out of Pride to shew his quondam Friends his prefent Condition. But to fee how Wealth alters Things, every one of this wife Village now found Some Beauty in his PerSon, or his AfHons, and they all Swore that Surely Some Gentleman begot him, fince he diScover’d Siich Accomplifh-ments in all he did.
For my Part, I could not be of their Opinion; for Srruby Bob was still in my Mind, and I found nothing alter’d *n him but his DreSs; two or three thouSand Pounds a Year thrown on him by the fantastick Freakishnefs of a Woman;
gave

(61-)
gave him in my Eye no Quality, nor Appearance of a Gentleman. But this was nothing to me, I let the Villagers enjoy their Opinion, and paSs’d on to my own HouSe, fuller of Indignation for the Lady, than Admiration of Boh.
When I was got to Bed, I could not but re-fle£l: on the strange Alteration in the Opinion of my Neighbours in regard of Mr. Scmhy^ who could now think him charming in every thing, who a few Years before hist at him as intolerable in all.
_ /
In the midst of theSe Reste£Hons I fell asseep ; when Fancy began to work, and I imagin’d mySelf at the Foot of a Hill, which I had a Mind to get up, but was deter’d by the steepneSs of the AScent: But in this Difficulty methought a grave Gentleman join’d me, and taking me by the Hand, con-du6Ied me through a Secret Path , which Soon and with little Pain mounted me up to the Summit. But there I found a stop to my Journey by a most terrible Precipice, defended however by a Wall, in which there were two Holes, and thoSe filled with two Glaffes, through which I might take a View in Safety of all the Vale beneath me. Over one was written in Letters of Gold Phitu^ ^ over the other, in plain common Chara^ers, Penia.
Here, young Man, Said my Guide, look through this GlaSs, and if thou wilt profit by what thou Seest, confider that to be great and happy in this World, this is the God that m-ust'have thy chief Devotion,.	bestows

not only Wealth, but Power, Beauty, WiSdom, Valour, and all that is valuable, and esteem’d j look through and See his Devotees^ how charming they all are, how worship’d, and what Power and Grandeur they enjoy ; and then be yourSelf your own Judge, what CourSe to steer in the after PurSuits of your Life.
Accordingly I look’d through the GlaSs of Pliittps^ and beheld a vast Plain extended on every fide. Here were Several Thrones ered-ed, and on them Sovereign Princes Surrounded with their Pomps and Grandeur ; there were infinite Numbers of all Sorts, Conditions, Religions , and Nations ; in the midst there march’d on towards the Thrones various beautiful Appearances, preceded by a glorious Image all of burnish’d Gold, Supported by Several awful Figures, while the Eyes and Hands of all that follow’d it were lifted up to it, and receiv’d in Return whole showers of Gold, which fell all round them, and which though they pick’d not cleanly up, yet was no other permitted to touch any one Piece of it, but all was left, as it were to pave their Way, and not for LTc; as they went, they Sung divers Songs or Hymns, which made a most excellent Harmony, and vdien they approach’d the Thrones, they,made Several Speeches full of the mofi: moving Oratory that ever Mortals utter’d, till they sot round the Kinns and Princes, and hem’d them in, So that none could come to them but by their Permission.
Surely, Said I, to my Guide, theSe are Some heavenly Beings, Something Superior to humane

mane Kind j how univerSally charming their PerSons, not one Blemish among them ! What Harmony proceeds from their Songs, and what strange Emotions from their Speeches! With what Applaufe are they heard both by the Princes, and all thofe vast Crowds that look on the Procession 5 Cardinals, Bishops, Priests, Men, Women, and Children, are all transported with the ravishing Sight.
But hold, what are thoSe that follow them in a diSmal Train, where were they Scrap’d together? W^hat a Rabble of tatter’d Wretches, fee how all draw back at the ssght of them !
As ivhen a v:ell qrafd ABor leaves the Staste,
"Mens Eyes are taly bent on him that enters mxt^ Thinking his Prattle to be tediom ;
Ev’n foj or 'ivith much more Contempt^
Mens Eyes^ did fcou-l on this ragged Regiment.
No one minded them, or mark’d what they did or Said, unleSs to shew their Contempt of their Songs and Orations.
This Crew was conduced by Several lean Sower-look’d Figures, to whom they yet Seemed to pay a very great deal of Deference, Their PerSons Seem’d all deform’d, their Voices harsh, and their Speeches without Force. Yet now and then I obServ’d, that one of theSe was on a fudden by a blind Power lifted over the others, and Set near the Princes, and then aS-fum’d that Beauty and Charms they wanted before. But theSe were ff w in number.
Most of the forwarded and afbve of This

or

Heaven, and whoSe Ends extended So far, Shat they were not to be purSu’d by the Sight.
As for that Pavilion, faid my Guide, it is not
worth your regarding, leave it to the ragged Fools, who go on their Silly Pilgrimage to it, in hopes of future Glory, Immortality, and I know not what j you have the preSent in view, and must tnink of nothing elSe, if you would be like that iglorious Band, that fo dazzles your

Alas! faid my Guide, you are ignorant of theSe Matters, I that brought you up one Way, can let you down another ; the Defcent is wonderful eaSy, but you can never get up again, nor will you defire it. Give but your Heart and Soul to the great Pham, and you will Soon find Means of getting into his Favour, and sharing of his Bounty; but he will not be Serv’d by halves. You do not obServe, I find, that thofe bright and lovely Figures or Beings, who environ the Thrones, and bar all AcceSs to the Princes but by them, are likewiSe Surrounded by another Sort of more inferior
Crea^

■id

Creatures, like a List to a fine Cloth 5 look well, and you will find that they keep off all others Srom approaching the Rich, as the Rich do them from the Thrones. See how well they merit the Name of Umbra; or Shadows, for they watch the Motions oS the Great, and imitate their Ailions in all Things; they admire and applaud all the Wealthy Say and do, and So get into their Favour, and by degrees make way to the Princes themSelves. But thoSe who are the most cunning, and manage best, find out a little Trap-Door, which is under every one of the great Ones, and where his Vices and PleaSures have their Retreat, and if they once get well acquainted with them, their BufineSs is done, and they are Sure to riSe. There are a Company of filly Rogues, who have tried to recommend them-fel ves by Arts and Sciences, by endeavouring to instrufl and improve their Minds, but they Seldom get much for their Superfluous Labour ; for what should the Rich and the Great trouble themSelves with Such Things, when they are Sure of ApplauSe, are Secure of being admired
’em ? ThoSe are (Qualifications for the Poor, who with all their Arts, all their Knowledge, all their fine Genius’s, can Scarce be taken notice of.
This Part of my Guide’s Do6Irine Seem’d leSs relifliing to me, than even all he had Said to me before, for which methought I found no great Inclination. But before I could determine, 1 cast my Eye on the other GlaSs, and Saw a Hand pointing to an Instription, which

It put me in mind of my beloved /a'owf, and that made me reSolve to look through that likewise, which my Guide Seem’d unwil-ling to permit me to do. However I followed my own Inclination, and found it look’d into the fame Plain. But wonderful! what a change was there in the* View ? how chang’d ! how alter’d were all the Objefls I had Seen through the other GlaSs! ThoSe Demi-Gods, at lead thoSe who Seemed So before, were now all deform’d, ugly, mean, and affrightful. Their Songs all Dilcord, their DiScourSes dull and inlipid, their Looks had a mixture of Brute and Ideot; and thoSe who before appear’d little leSs than Gods, now Seemed below the Dignity of Men. And the ragged Regiment assum’d a more illustrious Form; Peace and Joy were in their Faces, Charity in their Miens, Beauty in their Figures, and perfefl Harmony in their Voices ; the Hymns they Sung, excelled thofe of Or^heu/s, Homer, or Pindar; Virtue and Knowledge were-their Guides, and led them on to the Pavilion of Eternity, which through this GlaSs shone out like a thouSand Suns. TheSe indeed look’d like the Workm.anship of Heaven, the others like the Creatures of Pin-
or the Devil, their Eyes all cast to the Earth and the glittering Dirt they ador’d, while the Idol they worship’d, now plainly appeared a golden (dalf, Supported by Avarice, Pride, Ambition, Self-love, anxious Cares, languid Joys, aukward Mirth, shameful Ignorance,

My Guide grew impatient at .my Satisfa£lion in this GlaSs of Poverty, and left me by my-Self; the Place and Solitude gave me no Small Fear, and that Fear awaked roe.

LETTER X.
To T. S. Efq;
S I R.
OINCE I ventur’d to Hint.to you my Opij nion of the Imitation of NemKs Prophecy, | and find it agrees in general with yours : Seei if I have expreSs’d your Thoughts of it i n the following Remarks.

The


( ^9)
The Ode in Horace is of the Sublime Kind, and one of the noblest Pieces of Poetry in that Author. He deligns to expreSs, in a Prophetick Denunciation, the MiSery and Ruin which be-fel the Trojans for the Rape of Helen ; the Sub* jest therefore is not only great and heroick, but has a Mixture in it of the Pathetick : To raiSe it yet more, a Machine is employ’d, and Nerem is brought up out of the Sea, stopping the Ship in which the Adulterer was Sailing for Troj', whilst he Sets before him the fatal ConSequen-ces of his Crime. The Speech is fit for a God, and the Dignity of his Charaster is every where Sustain’d in it.
Confider now whether there is any thing in the Cast of this Ode, or the particular Sentiments, that wou’d Suggest to you a merry Thought, or that Seems proper, by way of Pa-rodie, to be turn’d to a Subjest of Humour. I cannot tell whether there is any Allegory in it, or that Horace meant any Secret Application of this old Story to the Civil Wars, or Fastions in his own Country ; but this is certain, that the Moral is very noble and important ; and the Application of if to the Earl of and to the ConSequences of the Rebellion, is an elegant and happy Thought. It is certain too, that this might Have been extreamly well executed in the Serious Way, and was capable of being work’d up into a very fine Poem. However, I may venture to affirm, that (which way Soever is best) it ought to have been of apiece, either wholly grave, or wholly humorous. Instead of that it is neither, and yet both. The Imitator chuSes to be pleafant, but he follows a wrong
Idea:
(7°)
*
Idea : In Spight oS his Delign you See the Sublime and thePathetick have the Prevalency in it : The Serious destroys the BurleSque, and the BurleSque inSecls and debaSes the Serious. Can anything be more Solemn or poetical than theSe Lines ?

You will find Such another Instance of this improper Mixture in that Paragraph 5

The last Paragraph of the Poem has the Same Fault : For nothing can be more Solemn than all the VerSes in it, even to the middle of the last Line, when instead of ending Serioussy, Ijoc-fey is brought in to dole all with a Jest.
TheSe Instances I think shew, that the Hu-

Gi ve me leave to add a Remark or two about the Charaders.
There
( 7^ )
There is likewiSe Some Inconfistency here: The God Nerem is too much Sunk in the Scotch Wizard, and yet not enough. His Figure is very naturally drawn ; in the beginning oShis Speech you hear and See the SoofcFma>z j and his PropheSying the Plunder of the High-land Bonnets and Plads, are good Topographical Strokes of Nature and Humour : But from the Simplicity of this Charafler, you wou’d hardly exped that he shou’d afterwards grow witty and facetious : much leSs that he shou’d rife into the
Sublime, and Speak like the God Nereu'i m Horace's Ode, with no leSs Dignity both of Sentiments and Expressions. Bessdes, how comes he, after the first Paragraph of his Speech, all of a Sudden to forget his Scotch^ and not to drop a word more to' the end of the Poem ?
The Charaflers of the Loyal Chiefs are well drawn : Hay, Athol, DoagUs, Forfar, Argyle, are
finely complimented. Virgfil cou’d not have muster’d his Heroes more honourably. But in all this Part ( which I think is much the bed Imitation of Horace^ there is no Offer at Mirth or Humour, and no one of them has any Mixture of the Comick in his Figure, except Saiher-l.ind with Voice fo rujly : Which Circumstance (though natural enough) might better perhaps have been omitted, fince the other Charafiers have no Such Sprinkling.
P’or the ReaSons I have here given, 1 cannot but wish, fince there are excellent Lines in this Imitation, that the whole had been Serious, and I am Sure the Imitator wou’d have Succeeded much better.

The Letter (Said I) is worthy the Author,
who is one of the most accomplish’d Gentlemen I know.

He is a Master in Mufic, a very good Painter, an excellent Poet, and a judicious Critic. Allowing all this, (alTum’d the Baron) I can I think add Something to his Remarks oh Horaces Ode. It was made (i( I mistake not) on this Occallon. Augufius C^far had a mind to remove the Seat of Enmire from Rome, to the Place where Troy once stood, which put Horace on shewing in this manner that the Place was accurs’d by the Gods, and that no City should proSper that should be built on it.
But in my Opinion, concluded the Chevalier^ the Engfijh Voemy with all its Faults^ has Merit enough to deServe our PraiSe.

My Lord,
QINCE my Opinion of your Lordship’s ^ Judgment, and Publick Spirit, has already drawn on you my Importunities for a very con-fiderable Service to our Common Country, (for which certainly a Man of your Lordship’s Post, Quality and Fortune, cannot be leSs zealous than I am, who nave nothing to loSe, by its Ruin, but my Life ) 1 must beg leave to remind your Lordship of thoSe Hopes, you have been pleas’d to give me, that my PropoSal of the Academy was not only highly reaSonable, but that your Lordship wou a contribute all your Zeal, Power and Interest, for the Speedy perfecting of a Destgn So beneficial to your Country, as well as honourable to yourSelf. And, my Lord, I must beg leave of your Lord-ship to uSe all that honest Liberty which the Importance of the Affair requires, and the great' ReaSon and Judgment, your Lordship is Master of, will admit; Since after this time, I shall
not
(77)
not sive your Lordship any fruitleSs Trouble m a CauSe, which in itSelf (if justly weigh’d) must be more pathetick, eloquent, and prevailing to a Man of SenSe, and a true Statesman, than the Tongues of the best Orators and Pleaders cou’d make it, with ail the Foreign Additions of Art. For Truth, as well as Wif-dom, has in its bare and naked Beauties more Charms than they cou’d receive from the gaudy Colourings of the Pulpit, or the Bar.
If therefore, my Lord, what I have Said, and what I now shall Say, will not accomplish what I aim at with your Lordship, I am unacquainted with the Advantages of Impudence, and im-portunite Teizings to recommend it; Not that 1 am ignorant that few gain their Point at Court without them ; but that I am conScious of the evident Merit of the PropoSal, and of your Lord (hi p’s being not only a true, but a judicious Patriot, whoSe Understanding distinguishes , and whole Love promotes (without thoSe Goads and Spurs) whatever is beneficial and honourable to your Country, and to your Prince, whoSe Interest, Honour and Glory are, in my Opinion, truly and inSeparably the lame ; and for which,justly united, I can, I thank God, with as much Willingnefs and Joy Sacrifice my-felf as Cu Fm., or any honest Roman of them all 5 for as I have always lov’d my Friend better than my'Self, So I shall always love my Country and my Prince better than my Friend : I hope therefore, that your Lordship will forgive any Liberty I may take in this DiScourSe, fince the Love of that Country prompts me, and the Service of my Prince in her Honour, Grandeur and

Lbs lime of VYir, no improper Lime for Under--takings ProduBive of a Puhlick Spirit.
My Lord,
O purSue my Deflgn, I must put your Lorcl-ship in mind of my Arguments in my former Paper, mentioned in my last. The Words in my first PropoSal, are theSe ;
“ It may be objested, that this Time of War “ is not a proper Junsture for an Undertaking “ of this Nature , but with Submishon to better Judges, (to Say nothing of parallel Instances ) I think this is infinitely the most proper Time that cou’d occur ; for when So necessary, bloody and expenfive a War is in view, all the Means that can be contriv’d to keep up the People’s ReSolution, must be allow’d not only proper, but necessary ; but to have a perpetual Succession of publick DiScourSes, dirested to that End, attended
E 4.	“ with

(C

(8o)
with the Pomp and Ceremony of the Performance, will hearten the People, awd fix their Zeal for the ProSecution of a War that wou’d daily be made appear of that Necef-fity for their Defence, nay Prefervation. And the Daily PraiSe of her Majesty’s Condust, the A£Iions of her Generals, and the Juft-neSs of the Administration, would raife the People’s Admiration, Admiration W’ou’d beget Love, and Love is always a£Iive in the Service of the Belov’d.
I must farther add, that Alfred, who fought with an Enemy in the Bowels of his Kingdom 40, or as others 80 pitch’d Battles, in the midft of the Danijh Invaston founded Oxford, and fe-veral other Schools of publick Learning ; ordained, that all Men should put their Children to School till 15 ; gave Royal Encouragement to Learning in his Subje<fi:s, and by Rewards drew hither learned Men from abroad. Poetry had his particular Favour, as Writing in the old Saxon VerSe himSelf. This Prince, in infinitely greater Difficulties than theC^een, God be prais’d, is ever likely to be, found, in the midst of a powerful foreign Invaston, not only time to constder the Advancement of Learning and polishing his People, but thought it no ill Policy to do So : For whoever knows any thing of that Prince’s Life, must own him as eminent for Civil Government, as War ; witneSs his admirable Body of Laws, like thoSe of iduji'mian\ Codex^ and that AddreSs in the Management of his Affairs, by which, from the greatest Dili refs a Prince cou’d be liable to, in Spight of the excessive Pow’r of a barbarous Enemy, too often
stxt
(8i)
fixt in the heart of his Kinadom, terrible to his Friends, and watchful of his Motions, he establish’d the Monarchy of En^~and in So noble a Degree, that I doubt very much whether this Nation was ever more noble, more dreadful, more just, and more wife, than in his, and the Succeeding Reigns, till the Succeshve Degeneracy of Princes destroy’d the Foundation of that HappineSs he had So wiSely laid.
This, my Lord, is no ill Argument, Ishope, that the Time of War is not So improper a Time for the promoting Learning, and the polishing and refining the People, as may be Suppos’d, fince that only can render them capable of na-bler Notions and Actions, than can be expected from Principles So degenerate as are now a-mong us.
If my PropoSd requir’d any Money from the State, the important Emergences that demand it, might be a just Obstacle to it ; or if the powerful Interest of an oppofite Party were prevalent in the Cabinet-Council, the TediouSneSs of the Debates might at this Juncture take up too much time: But when we defire only a. bare Charter, without a,Farthing out of ' th’c QneeKs Pocket, and when there is no body to make an Interest against it but two or three Players, and that against she highest demonstrable Justice, ReaSon, and Religion; I cannot have So mean an Opinion of the WiSdom, Ho-nour. Justice, and Religion of thoSe that com-pofe it, as So mtvcli as to fear that there can bs one Word offer’d in their behalf.

Befides, ray Lord, Betterton., wHoSe Licence for A6ling expir’d with the late King, has^ found Interest enough to have it renewed by her Majesty, either with, or without the Advice ot the Cabinet-Council. If without it, certainly this, which is So much more to the Honour and Service of the Queen and Nation, can meet with no Difficulty there; if with the Advice of the Cabinet-Council, certainly thofe, who had leiSure to confider and grant a Licence, that, if throughly constder’d, ought to be Sup-preSs’d, will never SuppoSe it Time wasted, or Advice ill given to Set that up in a much greater Perfeflion. And I dare be confident, that they wou’d pay an entire Deference to your Lordship’s Judgment in a thing of that Nature, if they did not immediately apprehend the ReaSons and Demonstrations of its USe and Excellence.
Can any Time, my Lord, be more proper than that of War to reform our Vices and pub-lick AbuSes, and promote our Virtues, by which, or the want of which, all Nations rile or fall ? Can any Time be more proper than that of War, to reconcile all Fadlions, put an end to all Parties, whofe Animofities retard the DiSpatch of Publick Affairs, and give too many Advantages to the Enemy, as I cou’d eafily make appear ? It was a wife and just Observation o£Midpfa, on his Death-bed, to Jagurtha, and his Sons, that Concordia Res parva Crefeunt, Difeordia magnee dilabunturMnlon advances Small, while Faflion destroys great Kingdoms. But our Enemies, befides their vast Force, are made more powerful by a perfect Union among thetn-
felves,

(83)	'
Selves, and we are rob’d ev’n of that Pow’r we might have, if united, by fatal Parties, that lofe the publick Good in a blind Zeal for private Passions, and all Sprung from Avarice, or Superstition; for whatever interferes with the Good of our Country , is not true Religion 5 which certainly, when rightly understood, is the Surest Basts of the State , as it ha& always been itsDestruflion when mistaken. Can therefore any Time be more proper for the Removing, or to begin to remove, thoSe Obstacles to our HappineSs, than when that HappineSs is most at stake ? For there never has been, stnce the Roman Commonwealth, a Junflure So critical as this, on whole Turn depended So certainly the Liberty or Slavery of Europe. Let therefore, my Lord, theSe weighty Constdera-tions prevail with your Lordship to exert your-felf in th is for the Refcuc of your Native Country, and in that of all Eurofey from Danger, iff not Ruin. lam,

More Arguments to the fame Purf>ofey See,
'My Lord.
TO purSue this Point yet a little further, the great Divifjon in England, my Lord, is betwixt the Diffenters and Church ; for this includes all the lesser Political Fadions, The
Dissenters have always grown by PerSecution; and their Pride, and Ostentation of Suffering, Kave won not a few to their Party 3 for while Mankind are more govern’d by their Passions than their ReaSons, the Suffering Party will still engage the Multitude, while their Pity bribes their Judgment to believe, that the Suf-
ferer is always in the Right, eSpecially in Matters of Religion, in which Zeal and Obstinacy have So large a Dominion. That Formality, and Specious HypocriSy, that has promoted this Fa£bon, gain’d new Force from PerSecution, which would infallibly fall off on an entire Remission of Severity towards them, and their Vizor of Austerity wou’d drop to the Ground,, if theyenioy’d a perSefl Tranquillity, and were foftned by frequenting publick Diverssons. But while the publick Diverssons lie under Such Prejudices with them,, they will never participate of them, and by conSequence cannot be polish’d by what they think a Crime to behold : Whereas, if by accomplishing my Pro-poSal they were put on an unquestionable Bottom
I
u

(85)
totii, the Dissenters wou’d not Scruple to come to them, and by that means in time wear off the Rust of their AffeClation, whence both their Obstinacy, and our MiSeries proceed, and by conSequence, my Lord, no better Time than' this can be found to Set aSoot So necessary a Work, which cannot be too Soon begun. But that theSe Diversions are conducive to this end, I. will not obtrude my own Opinion dogmatically; but prove by^the SameEffcist, in the lik Circumstances, the Certainty of my Pofition. No Time nor Age produc’d a greater Man, than Lorenx.0 di Media ; and he, to SuppreSs the Divilions of Florence, took this very Method , as will hereafter appear.
Again, my Lord, in this Time of War Mr. F-— has got dooo /. Subscriptions for the Building a new Theatre for Opera’s in the Hay-Marlirt^ and has already taken meaSure of that in Drury-Lane for his Model ; which is a very pregnant Argument, that he understands nothing of Theatrical Architeifure, for nothing can be more contrary to it than our Theatres. I confeSs, my Lord, that your Lordship has-not So abfblute a Pow’r in the Court, as Fdckelieu had in that of Fiance ; yet it can be no Doubt to any that know your Lordship, but that if you wou’d exert that Interest and Pow’r you have with her Majesty, and the Cabinet-Council, you might with no great Difficulty obtain a Charter, which wou’d be So honourable to yourSelf, So Serviceable to her Majesty,. and So beneficial to the Nation. The (Opinion they have of your Lordship’s Candor, Judgment, and
Honour,

Honour, wou’d give a prevailing Influence to their Advice ; and the Evidence, that in this your Lordship a£l:ed without any private View oS Self-Interest, wou’d still add freSh Force to your ReaSons.
If Mr. V------ (without that (i^ality and 0-
pinion your Lordship justly enjoys) cou’d per-Suade So many to SubScribe Sodargely to the Six thouSand Pounds out of their Pockets for a meer and imperfefi Diverfion, at a Time when our Great Men are not very forward to part with their Money, (the greatest Obstacle to a thing of that Nature) how much ealier wou’d it be for your Lordship to win the ConSent of a much Imaller Number to that which does not touch a thing So Sacred as their PurSe ? I have not forgot the Difficulty your Lordship Seem’d to raife, that it wou’d be look’d on, in your Lordship, perhaps, as too partial aFond-neSs of a Study, to which your Lordship’s Inclinations were So notorious ; yet, my Lord, I hope, you will give me leave with Submission to anSwer, First , That when this Dessgn is back’d with So many, and Such Substantial ReaSons for your Zeal, as well as their ConSent, it cannot justly be judg’d a partial FondneSs of Inclination, for that is never Seconded by Rea-Son. Next, this Dessgn is not confin’d to Poe-try ; it only protefls that, to Secure the Fund for the promoting all manner of ufeful and polite Studies, which can make a People great or happy. Thirdly, To apply my Self to thoSe that are not inclin’d to Poetry, and the other Polite Arts and Sciences, wou’d be to create

(87)
Difficulties not S6 eafily Surmounted, by one Ib little known as mySelf, while thoSe Demonstrations, I have form’d, will come with greater Force and Advantage from a Man of your Lordr ship ® Quality and Reputation : For the great-r est Part of the World judge of the Force of a thing, more from the Condition of the Man, than from its own Energy and Demonstration ; and most of our EnLlijh StateSmen and Courti--ers have So peculiar a Path to tread, that to offer any thing out of that common Road , is:^ either to confound them, or raife their Con^ tempt.

Am not ignorant of the general Contempt our Englifh Great Men have ever bestowed on the most uSeful Projects ; and Coiumbm is a plain Instance how little apt our StateSmen have been to give Ear to any new Defign, by which we then lost the richest and most noble Part of
America : But, my Lord, a Man that has any
Portion of Understanding, must perceive how
abSurd a Conduct this is ; for if the World had been always So averfe to new DiScoveries, we had now been as barbarous as the most ignorant of our Ancestors. Nay, this Principles an Enemy to all Knowledge, for no part of that but daily admits an Improvement: And I’m Sure, unleSs our Politicks had better Events, we have no reaSon to be deaf to any thing propos’d for their Advantage.

(89)
most Rank for both. Thebes found this in the Administration of Efamlnondai,^ who lifted her up by his lingle Virtue above all the l^pub-
licks of Greece.^ and Lacediemon ; which Glory she never knew before nor after his time. Thus Cofmo the Old, and his GrandSon Loremo di Medicf started up from a p>rivate State, and rais’d Florence from a degree of Barbarity and Contempt, almost ruin’d by domestick Fafbons, to the Power of coping with more than one Italian State at once. The latter uniting the most Seditious and divided City in Italy., and during his Life preServ’d that Unity among them, which ended with his Death, to prove that it was only one Man’s exerting his own lingular Virtue, that did that
O	/
Miracle. The Guelfhs and the Gihellmes for the Popes and the Emperors, were not unlike our Fa(stions of WFt^ and Tory, or Church and DiJJen-ter 5 yet by a Political Encouragement of Learning, thefe two Great Men SuppreSs’d them; the latter by a Defign not unlike mine, of Soothing the rugged People, and diverting them by Plays, Painting, Mustek, and the like, from their Sullen and malicious Intrigues of Parties, which bad before brought their Commonwealth to its last gaSp.
. Thus, my Lord, if you wou’d exert your Interest, and that noble Spirit So conSpicuous in your Lordship , and appear at the Head of Arts and Sciences, and publick National Virtues (as by accomplishing the Destgn I have offer’d, your Lordship eastly might) you wou’d inSpire another Genius into the Eh^lijh, and stop the
hasty
(.9°)
hasty Ruin of your Country. We have the Same Fa6tions and Divistons Florence ^as deliver’d from by Lorent.o di Medici; but our pub-lick Diverstons are too much Sunk in the Opinion of the World, and too obnoxious to that very Party they shou’d chiefly be dirested to Soften ; nay, they want another Turn, with Something different and more noble than the preSent, to stir up the Curiostty and Appetite of thoSe who yet frequent them, which my De-lign will most certainly accomplifli, elSe they must in a few Years fail of courSe.
But, my Lord, to prove my Affertions from Experience, I shall here quote what Farillas tells us in this particular ; He was the Restorer of the Drama, like a true StateSman encouraging Poetry, to refine and polish his Florentine Fellow Citizens.
“ But (as Karillas Says) as Lorenu had a nice Wit in Gallantry, as well as all other things, he fell to the Reforming the Recreations of the Carnaval, loy making them more ingemom, and more; capable of being relijh'd by Perfons oj Honour, * For the better understanding of what I am going to Say, it is to be Suppos’d that the Faflions of the Guelphs and the Gi-hellineSy by obliging the Florentines to be perpetually in Arms, had introduc’d into their Sports abundance of Libertine A£bons, which “ Savour’d of War ; and had at last degenerated into Such a Brutality, as made it a Point

And to bring^ this Reformation about, he conSulted the Men of SenSe of Italy and So introduc’d Tragedy^ that at once delighted and instructed. The ManuScript of the first of which is now in the French King’s Library, and call’d, The Nuptials o/'Perithous, and the Combat of Hercules 'with the Centaurs ; adorn’d with Sculpture, Mustek,Painting,—And by encouraging theSe publick Shows, he aim’d at uniting the People’s Minds,

And it is plain, that what I have propos’d to your Lordship, is the fame Method that brought Arts to their Per-feffion in Italy., and heal’d the Hereditary Feuds that rag’d in Florence, though before I had read any thing of this Part of that History. I have, my Lord, laid before you the lame CounSel the greatest Man Italy ever produc’d, took for the Good and Glory of his Country. The Same that the greatest StateSman our Nation ever Saw, Harrington in his Oceana (a most

land, in the most perfe<st Form of Government he cou’d frame for us. The Same that Milton So wish’d, extoil’d, and recommended withfo much Force ev’n when the highest Zeal of Fa-naticiSm domineer’d : In short, my Lord, it is the Same that	establish’d with So much

Which confirms me in the JustneSs of my Foundation and Judgment in this Affair ; and gives me the Vanity to believe, that a PropoSal grounded on Such Experience, Such Authority, and Such Rea-fon, cannot be reje<sted or flighted without Some Violence to ReaSon : For if there be any Love of Honour, of our Country, or of our Queen in the Court, and in them who poffefs her Favour, this cannot fail of a Speedy Grant. The Motives that engag’d Richelieu in a lefs erfe£l Destgn of this nature were, no doubt, is DefIre of Glory, the Reputation of his Country, and the Service of his Prince, which are Motives that ought to influence all Men of your Lordship’s Post and Quality to the like Attempts ; for nothing can render Great Men worthy the Dignity of their Rank, but Atlions as distinguishing as their Titles ; Efpecially in a Country like England^ where Popularity is the Way to a just Esteem, and where there is not So profound a Deference paid to meer (Quality, as in France, Spain, and Some other Countries. For indeed , that which first rais’d one Man a-bove another, is the only just ground of Veneration,

Arguments for Gloryy and the Love of Praife
againjl a falfe Humility.
My Lord,
U R Nobility have not enough weigh’d the Nature of Government in general, or of the Englijh in particular; for if the Nobility grow cheap and low in the Eye of the People (as they will Surely do, where they neglect distinguishing themfelves as much by their Honour as their Titles) by lofing their Interest they weaken that Part of the Constitution, which has the Power to do more for the Preservation of the whole, if it kept up the Dignity of the Order, than perhaps all the rest:. And the Englijh on the other Hand always pay more to PerSonal Worth, than to
Title.

Title, especially when they stand in Competition. England values itSelf extremely on being a Sree Nation ; and luch are Seldom won by leSs than Attempts, at least, at public Actions. The Popularity which ariSes from thofe is noble and delireable, and cannot justly be condemn’d of Vanity out of a falSe Stoical, or Christian Humility; (in which pure Religion, Public Examples are often, and emphatically recommended) for that can be no Virtue, that is inconfistent with the Good of Humane Society, as that fallc Humility that contemns Glory is. God made Man a Rational and a Sociable Creaturenay, has put him under fo great a necessity of Society, that he cannot Subssst withoiit the Benefits of it. Thofe, therefore, who promote Doctrines destrustive of that Society, must be odious to its wife Author Providence, as thoSe are most agreeable to it, who advance Maxims and Defigns mod conducive to the public Good. The falfe Maxims of Seneca.^ and thoSe not leSs pernicious of Our Monkish RecluSes, have produc’d very confiderable Damages to the Republic of Ewrojie, and eat' out the Coar and Heart of all pub Services; for they are the Refuge of Sloth, and the Source of a mean and private Spirit, Enemies to Society, which can be only preserv’d by A£bon. The Contempt of Glory is a Doffrine that promotes Avarice, for thofe who look on Reputation as a Bubble, and ef-teem it a criminal Vanity, will not be over Solicitous of what is faid of them, by that Indifference loofing one guard of Virtue, and one defence against the Assaults of Vice, efpe-

daily Avarice, and the blind purSuit of Riches. For while Seneca wrote against Glory, he amaSs’d Wealth by baSe USury, and Extortion ; and while the Monks wrote for Retirement, and against Worldly Dignities, they engroSs’d the Wealth and Power of Eurofe.
No Body certainly ought to be indifferent in public Affairs, for every Man being concern’d in the public Good, every Man ought to have a Regard to, and a Zeal for it, fince no private Good can be Secure, when that of the Public is in danger. A Nobleman particularly ought to have a public Spirit, and be Zealous for the Interest of the Nation, as receiving his Quality and Title for, and from public Service, and being distinguish’d by public Honours. Nay the falSe StateSman, who employs all his Interest in making up to himSelf a great Estate, ought for his own Security (if he understood it) to promote that of the Public ; fince without that he can have no Safe Enjoyment of even his public Robberies. The Necessity, therefore, and Obligation that every one has to contribute to the public Advantage, or Service, is a Sufficient Proof of the Folly and WickedneSs of recluSe Princi-; pies ; tho’ the Preference of the active Life to the retir’d, is too evident to need Arguments to convince us; this being confin’d to our-felves, that extended to Thoufands. This

The Schools and Gardens of Athens bred only uSeleSs Speculations, and were only the NurSeries of PhiloSophical Pride j where, while the Heads of each Se6l were buSy in advancing different Summum Bonums^ they lost the true and Solid Good of the Public, in which the Good of all Particulars was included, and which was never the Aim or Endeavour of the Gown in any Religion, who, by Preaching up Duties to make us better than Men can be, make us worfe than Men might be, if they ropos’d Things more within our CompaSs and ower. And indeed, the falSe Pleasures of Speculation are too lazy and Supine to give a strong or rational Delight. That whicli stows to a Man of SenSe from an aistive Life must be refin’d and vivacious. For how can the stothful Retirement of a Melancholy and Pedantic Life afford half the rational Sa-tisfa6Iion that a Man of Bufinefs finds in the SucceSs of his CounSels, and Endeavours for the public Good 3 when he restefls that fo many Thoufands, that is, his Native Country, depend on, and are happy by his Care, Industry, and AddreSs ? Retirement can afford no brisk and lively PleaSure, being remov’d from all thoSe Aclions and Accidents, that only can give it a Relifh, which can never be found in a calm, infipid Inaistivity; for Sloth, at best, can only furnish a bare heavy Indolence, a lazy Tranquillity, without any thing Great or Tranfporting.
Nor is this Preheminence of an a<stive Life meerly imaginary, but founded on ReaSon, in the Nature of humane Society 3 for that being





( P7 )
ing built on mutual Assistance, thoSe, who most contribute to it , must most according to ReaSon and the common Security: Whereas, if the Selfish-recluSe Humour should prevail, the Public Security must fall, and by conSequence the Private be destroy’d, while every Man direfis his whole Care to his own particular, and preSent mistaken Tranquility. If Man look’d only on the PreScnt, without any Eye on the Future, in what differs he from a Beast or an Ideot ? ’.Ds true indeed, that Such a recluSe Spirit is never likely to be UniverSal; yet Spain gives us an undeniable Proof of how pernicious a ConSequence it may be to the Public; for the vast Efflux of People to the American Conquests, was not more fatal to the Power of Spain, than the overgrown Number of Religious HouSes and Mo-nastries, beyond all Proportion to the rest of the People, where Co many were daily buried to the public Service.

My Lord^
BU T tho’ there is no great fear of that particular Mode of withdrawing from the Public to the Private in this Protestant Kingdom, yet there are other Ways not lefs detri. mental to the Common-wealth, perhaps more, which may, nay, have too much prevail’d here. For whatever diverts a Man from a public to a private Spirit, must contribute to ihe common Destruction; and that is the Spirit of Avarice, which has Spread So far in this Nation, for it too efficaciousty promotes a pernicious Principle of Distinction betwixt the public and private Interest ; and by a fatal Mistake makes Men always Sacrifice the firll to the last, which in Time must inevitably de-stroy Both. Avarice has the fame (if not a far more pernicious) EffeCl on the Public, as that melancholy, recluSe Temper; for it robs the State of as many Members, as there are Perfons infeCted with it; nay, it not only robs the Commonwealth of So many uSeful Members, but by Setting up a distinCl Interest in them from that of the Public, creates So many dangerous Enemies to it. And
this distinCl Interest does greater or leSs damage



A99)
mage to the State in proportion to the Post, Quality, and Power of the Avaricious Mart.
For let us SuppoSe a first Minister of State, or Favourite extreamly Covetous, and then add to this Suppofition a PropoSal made to him for the Public Good and Benefit, by which his particular PurSe gets little or nothing ; out of a Habitude of Court Civility, or unable to contradifl: Demonstration, he may approve the Defign, and give hopes enough of SucceSs to betray a Dependance j but we must: never hope, that he will ever have Sincerity enough to accomplish it; for he has too many private Aims and Occafions to make uSe of his Interest with his Prince for enereafing his own Wealth and Estate, to throw away one Demand for the Public Good. On the other hand, my Lord, give me leave to Suppoie another PropoSal made to the Same Avaricious Favourite, and that extreamly beneficial to him-Self, but detrimental to the Public, he is not able to refist the Temptation; the Gold it brings has no Faults, and his Soul being infinitely charm’d with its Beauty, he employs all his fine Arts of Modern Politics to find how he shall enjoy it under Some plaufible Name of Public Interest or Necessity; which Knack alone has more than once made a Man’s Fortune, and advanc’d him from a Projeflor to a first Minister. Francejeo de Pat.zi a Florentine Spend-Thrift, (more infamous afterwards by his Vil-lanous Conspiracy against his Country, and
the best of Florentines^ Lorento di Medici') was introduc’d to Pope Sixtus the Fourth for his Dexterity and AdareSs in finding out new Imposts
F z	and
( 10° )

and Taxes under plaufible Titles, and for that Faculty alone was rais’d by that Pope to be a Favourite, and chief Miniller of State.
But, my Lord, if you will yet give me leave once again to SuppoSe, that the Gold and AddreSs of Some Foreign Prince makes way ro this Favourite to betray the Secrets, or to mif-lead the CounSels of his King and Country, what Defence has he against the powerful Charms of Such a Bribe? His Judgment is blinded by Defire ; the only Thing he loves, is offer’d to his Poffestion; His Virtue (if ever he had any) long fince forgot, and Sunk in the Opinion, that it is nothing but a Specious Name, of no farther uSe than to Serve his Turn, a taking Bait to angle for Trusts, and his greatest Security in betraying of them. How could (I Say) Such a Favourite refuSe Selling his Country, if he met with a Prince, that wou’d come to the Price ?
Tliat Things of this Nature have been done, and ev’n m our Age and Nation, is a Truth no Man can doubt, that has known the World twenty Years and upwards; but it is’a Truth Safer to controvert, than prove. However, -from this Suppofition, my Lord, it will appear, how much more pernicious this private Spirit of Avarice is to the State, than that of Retirement.
Of PropoSals beneficial to the Public I could give various Instances, but I shall confine mySelf to this, that I have now made to your
Lordship ; his above Seven Years fince I made
it to my Lord--------, encourag’d to it by the
Reputation he had obtain’d of being a mighty
Patron
/
(I
01
)
Patron of the MuSes, tho’ I experimentally found common Rumour as falSe in that, as her other Reports. For tho’ he was So far from rejeffing it, (when far from the Perfeff ion your Lordship Sees it in) that he receiv’d it with all the Alacrity and Satisfaflion imaginable, and with frequent Affurances of a DiS-patch as Speedy as So uleSul and noble a Defign deServ’d j yet, my Lord, after Some Years Attendance, all this Heat and Zeal vanish’d.
Rut, my Lord, this is a Principle too far Spread among our Great Men; the Traders Vice has taken too much hold of them, nay, Avarice is as much more pernicious, as conSpicuous in them-They have been too much Slaves to a falSe Pride, that centers in themSelves, that directs all their Thoughts and Aftions to the lazy Satisfaflion of their own brutal or infamous Inclinations. Their Ostentation and Vanity is confin’d to the narrow Circle of themSelves, and cuts them off from the Public more irrationally, than the poor Principles of a recluSe Life. For at the Same time, that they run down the generous Vanity of the Greekj and Roman^^ their Pride of Noble and Heroic Aflions in the Public Service, they would fain Swell above the Vulgar with a falSe Pride of Birth, Title, or Wealth ! But if, as the Advocate of Truth, I might have leave to Speak my Mind, I would ask them what Pretence any Man has to Pride, or the preferring himSelf to another, who does Good to no Man ? When, indeed, he ought as little to ^^lue himSelf, as to ex-pe£l: the Esteem and ReSpefl: of others? AS-Suming without Merit, is the last Point of the
F 3	Ri-
( 102 )
Ridiculous ; for thus Fops, ugly Coquets, and Poetasters move not our Value, but Laughter and Contempt.
From this Source Springs that poor, tho’ conceited Content, to fink and paSs away in the common Flood of Mankind, without distinction from the Vulgar 3 but it is n6 Argument of their WiSdom, as contrary to ReaSon in that Duty incumbent on all public Members of humane Society, but is a Proof of a Little-neSs of Spirit, as well as SenSe and Understanding.

While the Esteem, that stows from public A£Hons, is firm, just, and extended; that which comes from Title, is precarious, and confin’d to the Hats of their Followers.

Money is the whole Aim of our Actions, and Motive of our Endeavours ; and that which promiSes most Gain, is Surest to engage our Attempts. But alas ! very few of thoSe Actions, that bring in most Money, are moft for the Public Interest ; and where a Public Good, and a private Gain contend, the first always loSes the Day. An Instance of this is in our Privateers, who will not attack thoSe of the Enemy, becauSe by that they shall get nothing but Blows, tho’ the Destru6lion of one Privateer is of more Service to the Na« tion, than the taking twenty of the Adversaries Merchants, confidering the low value of their Cargoes, the great value of ours, and how many of thefe may be Successively taken by one Privateer; the Destruilion of which is of more uSe to the Public than all their paltry Merchantmen, as feeuring our Trade and Commerce ; but this brings not the Same Profit into the Adventurers Hands, and we understand not the Principles of Sacrificing private Gain to public Good.

If our Nobility do not lead the Way, it may perhaps be more difficult to reform the People 5 , but with them it is most eafy, becauSe the Con-fpicuouSneSs of their Dignity and Title being advanc’d, and made glorious by Virtue and ' public Merit, would have a vast influence on the People, who being by that taught a just;

Veneration for your Order, their Veneration would naturally beget Imitation. So that, my Lord, your Lordship Sees, that there is no more likely way to Spread a public Spirit among us, than by your Lordship’s exerting yours ; for the AwfulneSs of the Solemnity ot doing it by this PropoSal, would run it into a Mode, and then every one would struggle, which should first get into the Fashion.
This I am Sure would Succeed, if our Noblemen were acquainted with the Sentiments of the People about them 3 but alas ! they are not fenfible how much their Conduct has lost their Interest in their reSpeStive Countries, as I could prove from a Man of the first Rank for Dignity and Estate, who has not So much Interest, as a Gentleman of Three Hundred Pounds a Year. For his exceffive Avarice cuts off all Means of Popularity ; that Vice naturally Squeezing all the Faculties of the Soul into a very narrow CompaSs 3 for getting Money being the whole Aim of the avaricious Mind, it destroys all that, which should render Men truly valuable, that is, truly noble and distinguish’d from the common Rank. For Co-vetousheSs is not distinguishing 3 a Cobler that is covetous, is as cautious, parfimonious, and griping in his Small Stock, as the Citizien, or Lord in their greater. Prodigality is preferable to Avarice, as more beneficial to the Public; for in th is the ProSufion of one promotes the Advantage of many, while the Avarice of one destroys abundance, who would clfe be uSeful to the State. It naturally di-
re£ls its Votaries to the Performance of poor
and
( i°7 )
and little Aflions, which as naturally produce Abhorrence and Contempt in the generality of Mankind ; and it is a hard Matter in our Age (where ReaSon has obtain’d So great a Liberty) to perSwade Men, that the Prince can give a real Value for that, which ReaSon and Nature command our Contempt of.
Befides, it is the most irrational and foolish
of Vices.----Amassing and heaping up Money
to obtain Pow’r, Interest, Glory, and the like, may plead Some Excule, becauSe there is an End propos’d ; but to rake it together, meerly to have Mountains of Gold by one, is a preposterous Dessre to be among Feasts and Banquets, without any Appetite or Stomach. I would fain know whether that Man, who pro--poSes no rational End and Aim of his Actions, Can deServe the Name of a Man, or rational Creature ? nay, he must be below a Brute, for a Brute a<sts not without Dessgn, direfling all its Aflions either to Preservation or Propagation of its Being and Kind. Now I challenge all the Devotees of Avarice, to lay down any rational End of their Defires and Endeavours; is that then worthy a Man of (^ality, which is unworthy a Man ?
But this is too large a Theme throughly to diScufs in this Place; it must Suffice to Say, that there is no Vice more destruflive to humane Society, and the good of all public Communities ; which made SaUuft in his ingenious Oration to 'ifulius Ctefar de Ordinanda KepuMica^ or of his reforming the State of Rom?., recommend a necessary and abSolute DiScouragement of the Love of Money, as most pernicious to

his Service, and most destructive of the State and HappineSs of Rome; and very reafonably too, lince no Member of the Commonwealth can love any thing beneficial to the Public, that is lost in So infamous a Pastion. For how can he aCt like a Man, who always thinks like a Child ? How can he have thoSe noble Sentiments, which your Lordship expreSs’d after your perufal of my first Paper, vit.

of the Degeneracy of the ‘Tajle of our Great
Men in their Pleafttres.
My Lord.
UT this is not the only Argument of the Degeneracy of the Great Men; the Depravity of their Taste in PleaSure is perhaps yet a greater Proof.
A hundred Years ago, there were about five or fix Play-houSes in this Town, (which then was far leSs Populous than it is now) all frequented, and full, tho’ the Stage was yet in its rude uncultivated Drels, without Art in the Poet, or in the Decorations, and only Sup-, ported by the lower Sort of People. Yet, my Lord, theSe lower Sort of People had Souls enough to be diverted by the naked and unar-namental Drama.
But in our Times the Great Men, who should in ReaSon have been the Guards and Supporters of the^ noblest Diverfion, that the Wit of Man-can invent, which at once instruffs and transports the Soul, were the first that con-fpir’d its Ruin, by prodigal Subscriptions for Squeakingand capering Monfieurs. And
the more infamousty to distinguish their poor and mean Diverfions from theSe more noble of the Public, they wou’d have no Play at all mingled with them, lest the World, should think,
that
(no)'
\
that they paid any Deference to Wit and SenSe, or that their Satisfaftion and Delight reach’d farther, than their Eyes or Ears. And yet to shew their wretched Taste, ev’n in thoSe they were generally pleas’d with what shock’d a nice Ear, and could not divert a curious Eye^ For the best of French Dancers are without Variety; their Steps, their Postures, their Ri-stngs are perpetually the fame, and all without any Meaning or Destgn ; and a French Dancer is at best but a graceful Mover, full of a brisk and fenSeleSs A^ivity, unworthy the Eye of a Man of ScnSe, who can take no Pleafure worth attending, in which the Mind has not a constderable share.
Were our Modern Dancers like the Mimes and Pantomimes of Rome^ our Dotage would be excuSeable. For one of them in a Dance by himSelf, by the variety of his Motions and Gesticulations, would reprefent a whole HiS-tory with variety of PcrSons, and that So very evidently, that a King of Perfia Seeing one of them, beg’d him of Nero for an Interpreter to the Several Nations and Tongues he had to do with ; fince his Aflion was a univerSal Language, intelligible to all.
In this Something must strike the Mind, and rationally entertain it, every A61ion depending on another, and all dire61ed to one End. But to be fond of our Modern Dancing, is still to be Children, and pleas’d with a Rattle that makes always the Same NoiSe. All that can be Said of Ballon (or any French Dancer of more Reputation) is, that his Motion is eaSy and graceful, the Figures he throws his Body into
fine,
(III)
fine, and that he riSes high with Freedom and Strength , the whole in short is, that he is an a6live Man. But is that, or wou’d indeed the Roman Pantomimes be a Sufficient Ballance against the Drama to any Man of common SenSe ?	^
I own, their ExcuSe is greater in their Indulgence of Mufic in their Subscriptions for Ita-lian Singers. Yet to be drawn wholly by Sound, tho’ never So harmonious, is neither the greatest or justest PraiSe. Yet it is certain that Mufic has an intrinfic Value, discovering a Power not to be refisted. But then this Power is heighten’d by the Addition of Poetry, and paffionate Words give a double Force to Harmony, and make it a Surer Way to the Heart, than when the Soul is not So fully concern’d in the bare Notes ; and Vocal Mufic is agreed by all the noblest and most touching ; that Tone being most excellent, which comes nearest to Vocal Sounds.
Mufic therefore ought still , as originally it was, to be mingled with the Drama, where it is SubServient to Poetry, and comes in to the Relief of the Mind , when that has been long intenSe on Some noble Scene of PaS-fion ; but ought never to be a Separate Entertainment of any length.
I give theSe Allowances, my Lord, only in confideration of good Mufic, Vocal or Instrumental, to which thoSe of the 1500 i. Subscriptions have not the least Pretence, as being the diSgrace of Mufic. But having heard in Italyj what Bubbles we Tramontam were in their
Foreign

()
Foreign Trash, ventur’d o’re the Aft to share the Prize.
Hence, my Lord, appears the Degeneracy of the Age, eSpecially of the Great Men, who were the Setters' up, and Encouragers of this paltry Diverfion. They can with no Shadow of ReaSon or Justice urge, that our preSent Plays are worSe, than thoSe of loo Years ago, for that wou’d be too palpable an Instance of their profound Ignorance, or extravagant Prejudice, which is below a Man of Judgment and SenSe 3 as may eastly be made appear in Tragedy only, of which we are Scarce yet arriv’d to a just Notion. Nor was there much of Comedy known before S,en "Johnfon 3 for no Man can allow any of ShakyfpeadSy Comedies, except the Merry W ives of JFindfor. There are indeed excellent Humours Scatter’d about and interwoven in his other Plays 3 but Ben ^ohnfon was the first, that ever gave us a true entire Comedy. Since him we have had Etheridge^ Wkherly^ Shadu'el^ and Croivn in Some of his Plays, with the rest of King Charleds Reigiii Since that Mr. Congreve in two Plays has merited PraiSe, and in one of them very well distinguish’d his Characters, and hit true Humour. Mr. Dennis has excell’d in. Comedy in the PM and no Plot,, and in Ifhigenla'xxi Tragedy ; and Mr. Fanhrookh^s shewn abundance of rude, ill conduced, and unartful Nature. His Dialogue ge-r nerally is Dramatic and EaSy 3 he is I SuppoSe no Scholar, and has run on Some monstrous Ab^ Surdities,in ConduC and Manners,-which want' of Skill in his Art has thrown him on. After theSe, our very Farcewriglits deServe more ES-
teem,;,
(ii3)
teem, than the taking Plays of an hundred Years ago, as having as much Nature, more Delign and Conduist, and more Wit.
Whence it appears that the Stage wou’d now meet with as much Encouragement, if our Audience of the Great Men had as much Soul, Force, SenSe and Spirit, as the Vulgar had then : Or if they! cou’d themSelves distinguish betwixt Good and Bad, So far as to encourage the Good, and explode the Bad, they would Soon have Plays more worthy the lijh Genius; but while they do direffly the contrary, we must every Day expe£l worSe, fince no Man of SenSe wou’d expoSe his Reputation to So Scandalous a Cenfure.
This, with what I have already Said of the Degeneracy of the Nation, is enough, I hope, to move your Lordship to fly to its Refeue, and stop its hast’ning Fall. I am,

Next it is true indeed, that we have People executing Such and Such Places and Offices, and that notwithstanding the general Corruption of thefe Officers, the BufineSs of thefe Offices is in Some Manner done; and by ConSequence, that our private Interest has the Same Effe<fi: with us, as the public Spirit had with the Antients, and other leSs degenerate People at this Time. Yet first—Avarice prevailing in our Ministers and Officers, that expoSes them to Bribes, and by thoSe to betray their Trusts and the Nation. And this is plain in the Vi£lualling-Of-fice, where corrupt Negligence, or Avarice
has
’•*9“
(”5)
has done the Nation irreparable Damage at Sea; the ill Condu£l towards, or Oppression of the Seamen in the public Service, diScou-rages them from it, making them rather take up with the French, than undergo the Hard" ships at Home in the Service of their o\yn Prince. Next, the avaricious DiScharge of thefe Offices, makes Men of Spirit and Bravery , who cannot brook the Slavish Treatment they meet with from Such Hands, for-Sake the Service of the Public, or elfe, which is worSe, join in cheating it in their own Defence. For no Man ever yet attempted to do Justice to the Public, by discovering the Cheats of thefe Officers, but was ruin’d by them, the USefulneSs and Honesty of the Undertaking not furnishing them with Patrons feven in the Parliaments) to defend them against the Power, Interest, and Money of the Offenders; for tho’ an Impunity in robbing the Public be a very great Encouragement to the Robbers, yet the Oppression of all thoSe who attempt their Punishment, puts away all Thoughts of returning to their Duty, being So fecure, nay perhaps only Safe in the Breach of it. And tho’ by the Strength of our Constitution deriv’d down to us from our robust Ancestors, the natural Wealth of the Nation, and the Number and Courage of her People, we may a little while withstand a total Sub-verfion, yet thefe Evils daily encreafing, must in a few Years entirely ruin us: For, like a robust PerSon, trusting to the strength of our Body, our Constitution bears up awhile against all the Attacks of a debauch’d and disorderly
Life,
(il(5)
LiSe, yet at last that gives way on the Sudden, and perishes all at once.
A Sure and lamentable Proof of my Speculation, is the late AddreSs of the HouJ'e of Cowj-
enough to evidence the Truth of the Fa£lr, and the Certainty of our Ruin, if not ijpeedily prevented.
I might instance the public L.oSs by Trade purely by the Interest of private Men who gain by it; but it would be too long for this Place, as well as the Source and Remedy of all thefe Evils, which cannot be compals’cl So eastly, as by the Establishment of my PropoSal, and the ConSequences of it.
I shou’d too here show your Lordship a Draught of the State of	when pre-
par’d by falSe Pride, Luxury and Avarice, for that certain and Speedy Ruin, which came upon it, as admirably painted by Ammianw Mar-cellinu^ in his xiv Book, but that it is too long for this Place. Where he shows what Virtues raiSed the Roman State to its immenSe Pow’r, and what Vices prevail’d among the Nobility and People in its Decay. The Great Men o£ Rome in its Declenfion were proud of their Equipage, Buildings, vast Revenues, and the like, never restefling, that Faledim Publico-la was burled at the public Charge; the Widow and Children of Regulm maintain’d by his Friends, and the Portion of Scipio’s Daughter paid her Husband by the State; the later So-mans plac’d all their Pride and Glory in them-felves and Retinue, wholly forgetting thoSe Virtues, that fix’d Such a Force to the Roman Name, that ev’n then preServ’d their Luxury
and
(”7)
and Folly. But they Soon felt the ConSe-quence; Sor in an Age or two they Sunk under, and were overrun by barbarous Nations, that their Ancestors contemn’d. Gaming, Drinking, Feasting, Mimes, Dancers, Singers, Eunuchs, and the like, were their Pride, and their PleaSures, of which every Man of Figure had whole Bands in his Train. The common People, by their Example, were as idle as debauch’d, by which they lost all GreatneSs of Mind, all Military Virtue, and in the End their Empire.
In England too, we have had Instances of another Sort of a Spirit among our Nobility, as v:hen Edu-ard the Black Prince was a Terror to France, he bestowed 500 Marks fer Annum on the Lord Audeley, after his Service in the Battle of PoiBiers or CreJJy, which Lord immediately gave the Royal PreSent among his four Squires, who fought bravely with him ; which being carried to the Prince by Some Court-Informers, as a flight of his Gift; my Lord was Sent for, and own’d the Fafl in Terms to this PurpoSe : May it pleaSe your HighneSs, thefe four Gentlemen behav’d them-Selves better than mySelf, and deServ’d the Reward I have given them, and bleSs’d be God I have Estate enough to enjoy all I de-flre. The Prince, touch’d with his Generofity, confirm’d his Donation, and gave ray Lord Fi ve Hundred more for himSelf. Thefe are Actions worthy an Englijh Prince, and worthy an Endijh Nobleman.
♦
But
( ii8 )
But now, like the Roman Nobility in the Time of Ammianm yiarcellmm, our (.Dality distinguish themSelves generally Speaking (for I am far from including that illustrious Body, of which many are yet, and would be more worthy their Titles and Esteem) either by excessive Avarice, or Prodigality. Their Quality they urge, as a Defence against their lawful Debts, or as a Bar against the CourSe of Law: They either Swell with the Vanity of an ancient Family, or the GreatneSs of their Estate and Wealth. A French Fidler, or a french Valet is generally their Favourite, for they are often So bad EngUpmen to prefer any Foreigner to a Native, tho’ they are generally infinitely worSe ; but the Foreigner makes up his Defefls by Impudence and Fawning. I remember, that Euripides in one of his Fragments Says, that he, who loves the Manners and Fashions of another Country, has evn in that betray’d his own. If we should judge our Great Men by that Rule, (which is very well grounded, if justly weigh’d) how many Traitors shou’d we find ev’n among our Legistators ? I have observ’d that Men of Letters, Wit and SenSe, are Seldom encourag’d and entertain’d by our Quality, whereas if they were, they wou’d be more justly Serv’d, and get more Reputation by their Condudl. A Man of true SenSc must be an honest Man, and by conSe-quence would not abuSe his Master’s Ear, to the lost of his Credit or Interest. For there are a great many of Figure in the World, that are So govern’d by their Servants, as to have
nothing
( oi p)
noshing but the Sormal Name of Masters left them, by that Means making themSelves a Jest to the World, and a Property to their Domestics. I am,

U T, my Lord, it is not the BustneSs of this Time or Place, to draw So just and rigorous a Picture of too many of our Quality, as I eafily could; most of whoSe Follies wou’d vanish in the Imitation of your Lordship, if you wou’d exert thoSe noble Maxims, of which your Lordship is Master, into Action, in the Accomplishment of only this one Defign, on which So many depend of that extraordinary USe to the Public, that, my Lord, you might live to See the Englijh Name more glorious by your Lordship’s Means, than ever it has been stnce a Nation.

In short, my Lord, on You the Genius of your Country calls 3 to You she Sends out her tender and expiring Complaints ; from You she begs Security from impending Ruin. To You the Glory and Safety of England (your native Soil, a Name dear to the most barbarous) comes with Suppliant Hands, imploring your Help and your Interest. On You, my Lord, Posterity calls to prevent thoSe MiSeries, they must elSe be born to: Nay, on You, Nature and ReaSon depend for their Right, and Heaven itSelf, which is always delighted with Deeds be* nelicial to humane Society, challenges this Return from your Lordship for that SenSe, that For-tune; and that Interest it has given you with your Prince, to exert it all shfar, as to accomplish a Thing, that evidently tends to the Safety, Glory, and HappineSs of that Nation, of which your Lordship is So very confiderable a Member.
Were the Difficulty greater by infinite Degrees, than it now is, yet, my Lord, a Genius like your Lordship’s might ealily Surmount it; whereas, here is nothing requir’d but your Lordship’s Speaking to the Queen, and bringing over a few Noblemen to affent to a Demonstration, who would think your Lordship’s Authority Sufficient.

IS true, as I have already obServ’d, that * your Lordship has not So arbitrary a DiSpoSal of Things here, as Richtheu had in France ; yet, my Lord, give me leave to Say, it is in your Power to do this, by exerting that Interest you have.
How much the ReSolution of one Man can do, tho’ a Subject, is plain from Lorento MMe-diciy a Nobleman of Florencey who on the Death of his Father Pierroy (a Man of Small Parts, and maintaining his Authority perfestly on his Father’s Reputation) was left Scarce Seventeen Years old, in the midst of dangerous Wars of the State, and more dangerous Factions against his own HouSf, and yet overcame them all by the Force of his own Genius.
“ Of all the HouSes fSays Farill.ts') that now bear Sovereign Sway, there is not one, that has been reduc’d to stranger Extremities than that of the Mediciy nor was that ever So, near Ruin, as in the fad Conjunffure, when young Lorento became its Head.

He became the Head of his Family, and one of the most confiderable Citizens of Florence^ at an Age when others require Several Years a Guardian ; and his Youth was almost equally deSpiSeable to his Friends and Enemies. He found himSelf engag’d in a War, for the Support of which, all his Hereditary Wealth was too Small ; and which was worSe, this War Seem’d to threaten Con-Sequences of a longer Date, lince the Repub-lick of Venice was concern’d in it.
“ Belides the declar’d Enemies of his Houle, that appear’d Twenty thouSand strong in the Field, there were abundance both in the Tuf-State, and in the City of Florence^ that were as much to be fear’d. The Murmurs of the People had already shown how weary they were of the War, before they had Suffer’d any Inconvenience from it, and gave out, that they wou’d make their Peace at the Expence of thoSe who had been the Caufe or Pretext of the DiScord.

his Accommodation apart. In few words)> the Danger was So great, and Seem’d So inevitable, that there needed the utmost Endea-* vours of the most heroick, and consummate Virtue, to vanquish So many Difficulties.
“ Neverthelels, Lorento M Medid^ as a Proof of his Judgment, ReSolution and Force, undertook it. History Supply’d his Want of proper Experience, and he loon shew’d him-lelf a Man that wou’d fill the Place both of ** his Father and Grandfather. Thus far /O-
In the midst of thele Difficulties, my Lord, and coming So early to the Management of Publick Asthirs, the little Wits of Folterra^ for his ProgreSs in polite Learning, and his Studies under Angelm PoUtianm, lampoon’d him , becauSe Learning was not then uSual among the Italian Noblemen ; yet by the Assistance of this, in the height of this Struggle of State, and Crifis of the Fortune of his Family, he utterly destroy’d the Pitti under their Venetian General Co^Uone. And notwithstanding the fordid Jests of the ignoranton a Nobleman’s Learning, in his Time he restor’d it to that Reputation, that his Master Politian had 500 young Gentlemen of Quality at a time, that waited on him from his Houle to his School, and thence Home again.
He founded the Univerfity of Pifa, and by large Benefices and Rewards drew thither Men of Learning in all polite Arts and Sciences,and, as a Spur to Emulation, fix’d Prizes for the best Performers.
G z	VaftlUs
(ih)
Faddi-a aCSerts, that there were better Painters, Sculptors and Architects in Loremo^s time, than in Old Greece., by his Encouragement of Alberti, who commented on Fitruvms, and improv’d Opticks in Painting. Leremo got together all Monuments of Antiquity for their-Im-provement, as well as the most excellent Maf-ters, to train up, and instruCl all that wou’d study thoSe three Arts; providing for thoSe who
had not Money, for he never ffafd his Ptirje in any thing that cod.d lift him above the Vulgar, The Works of the Learners were brought to the Test, examin’d by the Masters, and the Faults, which rob’d them of Perfection, pointed fairly out. Emulation was kept up, which encreas’d Industry and Perfection of each Art. In this School Michael Angelo improv’d himSelf So early to that degree, that at Nineteen his Copy of an Original was So wonderful, that they cou’d not be distinguish’d.
He fix’d a Defign of Phyfical and Astronomical Experiments : He perSuaded the Florentines to build Schools for the Virtmf, and Settled Penfions on them himlelf. To him we owe all the Gml:, Manufcripts brought from Conjian-tinogle, when that City was taken by the Turfs. He was not content to careSs the MuSes, and receive them frequently at his Table, ( as the Kings of Nagles and Hungary did at that time) but took care to exerciSe each in his properTa-lent,and gave them Spirit from his ownExample. He wrote Odes, Sonnets, Letters of Gallantry, a Dialogue of the Nature of Love, without any Imputation to his Gravity or his Politicks. And tho’ theSe, as well as his Book to
his
( 125 )
his Son, are lost; yet Panlu-s ^ovm. who had Seen them, makes them equal to the best Performances of that Age. If we conlider th-e Wars, the Negotiations of State he manag’d , the Conspiracies he eScap’d and defeated , the Fa(stions he quell’d, ^c. we shou’d think he had no time on his hands to regard Arts and Sciences 3 yet if we conlider his Zeal for theSe, and the Advantages they all deriv’d from him, one wou’d think his whole time Spent in cultivating the MuSes, and all this in a very little time, for he died at Forty three.
By his own Virtue, in the private State of a Subje(51:, without any Post in the Government, he rais’d his Reputation to Such a height, that all the Italian Princes paid an entire Deference to his Merit: Bajatet II, Emperor of the Turfs^ Sent to him to testify his Value for his Virtue ; and Matthias Corvinus^ Ki^g ®S Hungary^ Sent a Solemn Embaffy to him. The famous Cayte Bey, Soldanoi Egypt., Sent him Such magnificent PreSents, as no Prince had feen fince the Fall of the Roman Empire.
Oh ! my Lord ! which is more reaSonable, which more defirable to a Man, a Life likeLo-re«2.o’s, Spent in Astion for the Publick Good , his Country’s Service, and his own Immortal Glory 3 or a Sordid, narrow, stothful Age, stream’d out in a stupid InafHvIty ? If it is not in all Great Men’s Power to do what Lorent^o did, it is in all to attempt Something like it 3 and the Surest way not to attain what he did, is to perSwade one’s Self that one can’t, for that cuts off all Industry and Attempts : And I can--not, while I am Master of ReaSon, but believe
G %	that
(126)
that more Great Men have a heavier Account for negle6iing to uSe their Interest for the Bene-fit of their Country, than for all their other Crimes put together : .Dis betraying a Trust put into their hands by God and Nature.
Such was not Loremo cU Medici^ whoSe Actions in this Nature , So contrary to thole of our Great Men, are justify’d by the SucceSs of his Counlels, and the univerSal Approbation of Furore.
In short, as he was a Man of Letters, fb he had Parts equal to his Learning, which join’d, enabled him to make Such a Figure in both in Peace and War, that he always gain’d his Point, and Surmounted all Difficulties, not only of the Pat-Ffs Confpiracy, but the united and open Forces of the Church and Naples^ the Church and Venice^ Sic. And as by his own lin-gle Virtue he freed Florence from impending Ruin in the War with S'Xtm IV and Naples; So he by the fame reScu’d Ferrara^ and the young Duke of Mantua., from the Ambition of that Prelate, in fb Masterly a manner, that It at once difappointed and mortify’d his HoIineSs, by frishtning him with Summoning a Council, the Test of which Slxtm IV cou’d by no means think of standing. Thefe SuccefiSes of Loremo are the more remarkable, for being at a time when Learning was a DiSgrace, and for which he himlelf had been lampoon’d, as I have Said. Though indeed a Statefman that is not perfectly vers’d in History, must be a meer Dabler in Politicks ; and the Succefs of his CounSels, if they ever have any , must be like Empiric Cures, owing rather to Chance, or the Const!-

tution of the Patient, than to his Art v He doe^ in Politicks, as Some do in Religion, veil h is Ignorance under Arcana., or Mysteries. To-renT-o was qualiSy’d in another manner ; he was a perfeil: Master of the Constitution of the Government, and People of his own Country y throughly skill’d in the Inclinations, Intereits, Strengths and Weakneffes of his Neighbours, nicely vers’d in History, ancient and modern ; was furnish’d with a PerSpicacity, ReadineSs of Apprehenston, AddreSs, and an inviolable Honour, Royal Liberality ; and was a zealous En^ courager of thoSe Arts and Sciences from whence most of theSe Perfeffions proceed, and by which the rest are confirm’d, and grow fix’d and robust. As he immediately apprehended what was beneficial for the Publick, So he never wanted ReSolution to attempt the Execution of it ; and all the Inconveniencies and Difficulties that oppos’d it. Serv’d only to whet his InduS-try to accomplish it. He had a Solid Judgment, and a Sprightly Imagination ; w'as a Scholar himSelf, and Founder of an Academy of the politer Studies, though not So perfect as what I propoSe to your Lordship. I wish too many of onv Englifj StateSmen had not been more like his Contemporaries than him; for they neither knew nor Saw any thing but the PreSent, and judg’d of preSent Emergencies from their own Inclinations, or private Interest ; or by Some ill digested Maxims "Machiavel^ which, for want of Experience and History, they never understood, and by conSequence always miSapply’d ; for he that know^s not the Proof of Political Problems from History, will do with them as
G 4.	Some
(128)
Some Poetasters do with the Rules in Poetry, pretending to write regularly by Rules wrong understood, and So compoSe a Piece agreeable neither to the Critick, nor the Town.
Bur, my Lord, So good a StateSman as your Lordship, and So every way qualiSy’d for a generous Rival of Lorem.0.^ cannot but be struck with the great Aistions of his Life, and preSer the Reputation he had before all the poor Pride, and narrow Aims oS our mistaken Great Men. No more reaSonable, no more noble, nor any more feastble Means can be propos’d for your Lordship’s arriving to the greatest Esteem of all the prelent and futur-e Learned World, and indeed of all Mankind that can think, and shall know the Affair.
Should!, my Lord, multiply Words as long as my Zeal for this CauSe would furnish me, I might be tedious, but I could ne’er be stlent. But to avoid that TediouSneSs, I fear I have already incurM, I shall only add, that if after all I have Said, your Lordship may have anyRea-fons yet to deter and ssacken your Zeal in this Caufe; I only beg your Lordship to enable me to bring it into Such a ForwardneSs, that your Lordship may have no Trouble but a Word or two to give it the finishing Stroke. lam,

Well, Gentlemen, ( Said 1) what think you of this Packet ? For my part (Said the Baron) they pleaSe me very much ; but I am Surpriz’d that So much ReaSon has found So little Effeist in the promoting of So Publick Spirited a De-lign. That (assur’d the Chevalier) ought to be no Surprize in this Nation : It had been a greater CauSe of Wonder if the Undertaker had Succeeded. Little Projects for private Gain e-very Day carry their Point; and a Patent is Seldom refus’d to thoSe who Seek it on the least probable Grounds.

A Learned Controverjy between Adam Pump“< kin a Gardiner, and Alexander Gerund a Country School-mafier.
To Mr. Roberts, at his Lodgings at the Sign of the Mitre in Fleet-ftreeti London.
"M.y Friend Boh,
WHILE your Town is fill’d with the
Scolding Controverfies of the Learned, I venture to Send you one that has lately happen’d between a Gardiner of our Parish,
rish, and the School-master. Which of the two was theAggreSSor in the Quarrel, Ido not certainly know, each laying the Blame on his Ad-verSary. But whatever may have past before by Word of Mouth, is from the preSent Pur-poSe, lince it is evident that Gerund gave the first Attack in writing, Sure of the Viilory as he imagin’d, becauSe Adam cou’d not reply by, way of Pen and Ink, as not being able to write down his own Defence. However, that was a Defeat which he Supply’d by the Assistance of the Clerk of the Parish, who makes his Addresses to his Daughter Maudlin ; by which-means I have the Power of lending you his An-Swer to the proud Pedagogue. How this DiS-pute will end, I know not, both fides being obstinate, and utterly averSe to any Accommodation. If they go on in the Same manner, I shall take care to Send you what their Indignations shall produce, as very fit to be made a shrt in a Colle(stIon of the Argumentations of the Times. I am
Yours to command^
Samuel Oddlove.’
Adam^ thou ignorant Delver, be not proud" that I vouchsafe to write to thee, for it is to thy Confufion. Stop that noiSy Tongue of thine, nor loSe any more of thy Time in railing at Learning, and particularly at us who are the Teachers of it, for thou dost but kick against the Pricks, and bringst no Advantage either* to thy Self, or thy GauSe : I dare be confident that not an old Woman in the Parish will ever
G 6	be
(130
be So far thy Convert as to think the worSe of my Occupation, or the better of thine, or put us two on the Same toot for Excellence.
Great Princes have been School-masters, and the World grows wife by our Instructions : For utterly to confound thee, Hercules himSelf was but an itinerant School-master, who, travelling from Town to Town, instructed the People, fo that all the Monsters he kill’d, was Ignorance in Several Shapes. Homer was a School-master of Smyrnawhere they yet keep his PiClure ; and there writ a fine Romance, or Story Book, in VerSe, much finer than Halentine’s OrPn^ or the Seven Champions of Christendom, which he taught his Scholars, till a Gardiner’s Son stole his VerSes away, and run into Greece with them, and Set up foV himSelf; which was the ' Occafion of Homer s Travels to .find him out, and get his Book again ; and this gave pretence for So many Cities striving for the Honour of h s Birth. But we have yet had greater Men of our Profession ; Agamemnon.^ after he had conc[uer’d Troj)\ being cast away on the Neaf^o-ihan Coast, Set up a School, and there had for his Scholar Petromm Arbiter^ who in Gratitude mentions him in his facetious Book of Tales, written in excellent Latin in the time of Nero Emperor of Rome.
What ynzsDionyfim., but a great Prince, who, when his rebellious SubjeCIs had driven him from his Throne, went to Athens^ and as the nearest Dignity to a King, choSe to Set up a School ? where he had Such SucceSs, that he was choSen Parliament Man for that State;
and was aCIually one of the Areopagus when St.
’	Paul
(i33)
Paul converted him to ChrijUanity^ in which he prov’d So zealous, as to go and preach the GoSpel in France^ and in the Massacre of Parp$ had his Head cut off; but he taking it up in his Hand, walk’d away as far as St. Dennu.^ where he had a Mind to be buried, and has ever fince been the Patron of France^ all whoSe Kings are buried in the very Same Place. When will a Gardiner arrive at that Honour ? What should I mention more? Socrates was a Schoolmaster, and had Alcihiades^ Zenophon^ Plato^ and others to his Scholars; but being forc’d to sty from a ConSpiracy of the Gardiners, who always hated Learning, he eScap’d to Confian-tinople^ and there Set up a School, and- writ part of the Ecdejtajiical Hijlory which is yet extant. Qmntilian and Seneca were Schoolmasters InRomCy the latter had the great Emperor Nero for his Scholar, who burnt Rome only to have the Honour of rebuilding it of Marble ; but a Gardiner getting into his Favour in the fixth Year of his Reign, he put his Master Seneca to Death. For whom St. had that Veneration, that he pray’d So heartily for him, that he was carried by a Sort of Hahe.cs Cortm from Hell to Heaven, and left all the Gardiners behind him with the Devil. But what do I talk of this? Did not Adam^ the first Man who was a Gardiner, damn all Mankind, and brought Such a univerSal Ignorance on his Race, that it has been the BufineSs of the Schoolmaster to endeavour to remedy this Evil ever fince ?

LETTER II.
An Anfwer to the foregoing..
Saivny Gerund.
HOU hast reckon’d without, thine Host;, when thou didst think to confound me with thy Epistle, which 1 shall in few Words"^ confute, and shew thee to be a very lying ACs. For first, Hercules was no Schoolmaster,, but a good lusty raw-bon’d Fellow, and could do a better Day’s Work than most of his Time, and therefore was employ’d by an eminent Gardiner, to cleanfe his Stable, and dung his Ground ; but then asking more Hire than Au-gceus thought he deferv’d, he could not get his Wages, which the Gardiner honestly refer’d to the next Justice of the Peace. But Hercules wou’d admit of no Reference, and knock’d poor Auz^teus on the Head, and So run away to the next Country,, and was Safe till he play’d Some new Prank, for the States of that Part of the World were So fmall, that a Man run through two or three of them in a Day.
As for Homer,, I am told he was a blind Beggar, who having pawn’d his Verfes to that Gardiner for Herbs, Roots, and the like, was not able to redeem them, and So as a Forfeiture they were carried away. And bad Payment too. For how cou’d the Gardiner pay his Men, and go to Market with an old Ballad or two? but he was a mighty Lover of Ballads, and So
was
()
was content with that Payment, when no better was to be had. Th^it Agamemnon wa.s no Schoolmaster, is plain, for he was a good Cudgel Player, which no Schoolmaster ever was 3 So that from his breaking So many of the Trojans Heads, I rather believe him to have been a Gardiner. But as for your Roman Pedants, I have little to Say to them, unleSs that it’s likely they had all Popes in their Bellies 3 but you have forgot the Schoolmaster, who, to betray his Country, carried all his Scholars, under Pretence of airing them, into the Enemies Camp 3 but the Enemies General, who cat abundance of Sallad, if he were not a Gardiner, Sent them back again with each a Rod in his Hand, with which they flog’d the Tray tor Pedant back to his own Town, where he was foon hang’d, as you all should be, were I your Judge and Jury.
But how hadst thou the Impudence to mention Socrates.^ who was the Scourge of all the Pedants of his Time, and who was So fond of Gardens, that he had Ibme fixt in Athens it-Self, for the Philofbphers to walk in and chop Logics, And as for his Ecdefiafilcal Hifhry^ it is a meer Fiftion of thy own Brain, for he never writ any thing in his Life: He was a Fellow of a voluble Tongue, and could out-talk all the wiSe Men of his Age 3 but I question whether he could write or not 3 but Sure I am he never writ History, therefore, Gerund^ thou best in thy Throat. Thus thou hast made St. Dennis a Schoolmaster, whereas on Enquiry of my Neighbour Monsteur Dancee^ a Frenchman born
and
(i37)
and bred, I find he Scarce ever went to School hi in Self.
I could Say much for the Honour of Gardiners, and tell you of one A'dnom a Prince of a Country, and who entertain’d Vlyjjes in his return Home, who was famous for his Gardens. I could likewiSe, Gerund^ mention one Dioclejian an Emperor, who quitted the Empire to turn Gardiner. And your Anger against Adam, the- first Man whom your Dogship owns to have been a Gardiner, it shows your Ingratitude, for if he had not fain, we never had had the CurSe of Pedants, but all the World had been Gardiners. In short, you are yourSelves a Tax upon the Nation, and a NuSance to the Place where you are, and next Quarter-SeS-fions I intend to indite you, for your Brats make luch a hauling, that it frights my Team every time I drive to Market, and I am afraid Some time or other I shall Suffer in my Cattle, by the damnable NoiSe of a Company of idle young RaScals, who learn to rob an Orchard, before they can tell what’s Latin for an Apple. The Gonclufion of your Letter is as impudent as the beginning, by putting one Cicero on me for a Schoolmaster, when he was a Dealer in Vetches in the Herb-Market in Rome, and had his Name from that PulSe, for Pedant Cicero comes from Cicer, which is a Vetch in En^HJh. He was I believe a great Cornchandleri and by Som of his Works I fancy a Costermonger likewiSe, if not a Gardiner, for he writ a Book de Fimbus bonorum Maforum, that is, of the End or USe of
good
C»
(138)
good Apples, that is, of our Hentish. Pippins, they are the best Apples that I know of.-
But the Gardiners are not without their History Writers too; for, blundering Gerund. what dost thou think of one Ludus Flortts^ whoSe very Name proves him-a Gardiner, for
that is in En^'tfh Luke the Floriji^ from Flores Flowers; Florus eafily comes from Flores. So I now return thee the Halter you Sent me, and do not doubt but to hear thou hast hang’d thy-Self, on being So handled by honest
Adam Pumpkin.
This is a merry Quarrel (Said 0 and I think that old Adam has got the better of the Peda-gogue. The Pedagogue (affum d the Cbevalier} discovers a great deal of Ignorance, or Impudence, or both 5 and I believe (purSu’d the Baron) the Gardiner hy the help of the Phrish Clerk,, who Seems to be a notable- Wag,., is not behind Hand with him in either. In my Opinion (concluded' Downright) the whole Controverfy Seems much of a Piece with thoSe of the Learned, as they are call’d - there is a hearty Contempt of his AdverSary in each ; falSe Nations,, much Wrath, and very little Wit..

Some Comfort for a Cuckold.. ■
It is thus direfted,
'y at his Chambers in New
Inn, London.
"Dear Ralfh^
Have receiv’d your melancholy Letter, iti-which you complain of your hard Fate in having a Wife. You know what Gomet in the
S^anijh Fry at lays,----We are 'mctmed for our
Sins., and the Lord have hdercy upon us ought to be Witten over our Boors. And old Acajlo in the Orphan, in his dying Advice to his Sons,
fays,
1. et 7vla‘Tia<ge he the laji mad Thing you do,.
To fatisjy for all the former.
Did you know Woman (o little, as to place any HappineSs or Content in a Wife ? How came you to forget the SucceSs you had found with other Mens Wives, that^you could ever think of having one yourSelf ? What Charms did you think an old Batchelor should have to tie the wandring Appetite of a Woman to himSelf? Or cou’d you have the Confidence or Vanity to imagine, that you shou’d fare better, than your Neighbours ? For my Part, I have
that
-I
( H° )
, that value for the Sex, that I will trust none of them, that 1 may not be oblig’d to SuSpefi:, or curSe any.
But you may comfort yourSelf in this Affliction, by refle6Iing you are not a Cuckold alone, you have a jolly Company of Fellow-Sufferers; and it is So much the Fashion now-a-days, that a Man would be look’d on as a Monster that was out of the Mode : Every one wou’d think that you had made a very Scandalous Choice, who was not capable of provoking one to ask her the Question; for you know what Ovid Said long ago, who had a pretty large
Acc^uaintanee among the Bona Rood’s of Rome :
0
Cafla eji quam nemo regavit.
All I can blame your good Wife for in this Affair, is, that she manag’d So ill as to let her Intrigue be found out by the only Man in the World from whom she ought to have conceal’d it; for as long as the Husband is ignorant, the Wife is virtuous.
You know my Client Mr. GoIdhite\^ he married too, and thought himfelf the only happy Man, till he caught her in the Fa£l; but then with the Temper of a PhiloSopher he remain’d perfeilly Calm, no Blood and Wounds follow’d ; he only preSently order’d his Coach to be got ready, and taking her by the Hand, Come Madam (Said he) we must just now make your Father a Viiit. How unwilling Soever Madam was, she was fain to Submit, for as the
Emperor in Anrentehe fays,-------Vice make' them
humhlcy gives them Care to fleaje. They got to
her
( IT )
her Father’s by Noon, where Mr. Goldhite let both Father and Mother know the Adventure, and told them he had brought them their Daughter again.
The old Gentleman was very much troubled, for she was his Darling, and therefore endeavouring to pacify his Son-in-Law, he proffer’d to give him 500 b more, if he wou’d hush all up and take her Home with him
In short, Goldhite having brought him
again
The Father bid his
up to 1000/. conlented.
Wife take her Daughter to her Chamber, and feverely chide her. The young Lady and her Mother retiring ; the old Man preSs’d hLs Son to go with him, and listen to what his Wife should Say. The Motion being agreed to, they fixt themSelves to overhear the Ma ternal Leflure —— When they hear theSe
Words,----Oh! you heedlels filly Whore, to
be caught 1 I do not blame thee for Cuckolding thy Husband, for that’s a common Peccadillo in our Sex ; but I blame thee for doing it with So little Caution as to let thy own Husband catch thee in the Faff ; why I have made thy Father a Cuckold a hundred Times,
and he knows nothing of it yet.------Come,
come. Son, Said the old Gentleman, Come away, we have heard enough to Satisfy you, that you are not the only Cuckold ; you have me for a Partner, but with this Difference, you have got 1000 /. by being a Cuckold, I nothing.
Thus Goldhitehemg doubly Satisfied, return’d home with his Wife, who has ever fince been,
if
'^0
(
if not more virtuous, at least more cautious I wish you as good Luck, who am
Thy faithful Friend.
but no married Man^
JeOFFRYSi N G LEMAN,
Poor Oldfap (Said the Baron') is it come to this at last ? Is thy EncloSure broke up? Why Sue the TreSpaflScr, a gobd London Jury will give thee Costs and Damages enough, if thy Wife’s Gallant can but pay them.
But, (afSum’d the Chevalier) perhaps the good Lady made choice of one who is not worth a Groat, and then it wou’d be proclaiming him-Self a Cuckold for no manner of Advantage. ’Tis no great Matter'(Said I) that this is befal’n Oldfap^ who has all the Tricks of a thorough Attorney, (for I know him) and of a USurer, and a damnable Extortioner; and if all the young Fellows he has drawn in, or injur’d, stiou’d be receiv’d by his Wife, it wou’d be but just upon him.
Tho’ I am no great Admirer (Said Dotenright) of the Fair Sex, yet I cannot agree with Mr. Singleman.^ but shall always believe, that there are a great number of chaste Women, meerly out of a Principle of Virtue.

LETTER IV.
of Dancing
SPQ Mr. Gay land, at his Houfe in the PalL
mall, London. .
]Wy good Friend.
Your two or three last Letters have given me the Spleen So much, that I can’t prevent your having a share in the Effedl of it. I have no Patience to read your extravagant Panegyrics on a couple of Scoundrel French Dancers. How there is nothing So fine, So charming, Ib transporting as Monfieur Coufie ; and then Monfieur Rigadoon Surpasses all Mankind ; I am not able to repeat their PraiSes. If your Letters were read to a third PerSon, without mentioning their Faculty, he wou’d imagine you were giving the Eulogium of Some Heroes of Antiquity, for nothing Modern can come up to it.
Had your DeScription been of the dancing •of two beautiful young Ladies, it had been excuSable 3 for there Nature wou’d have pleaded for you, and your young Blood being Set in Motion by So engaging an Objeft, might stir up in your Fancy strange Ideas of PleaSure. But to feel Such Raptures from the Antic Postures, Capers and Gesticulations of a fenSelefs Monfieur, wou’d perSuade one that your Head is as
light
( ^44 )
light as their Heels. I expe^l e’re long we shall have a Book of your writing in thefraiSe of this fensseSs Diverfion ; but if you have any Such Thoughts, I wou’d adviSe you to read the Antients on this Subject, as LudaKs Dialogues^ AtheneeM^ and others; join to them Hieronymm Mercurialis^ and Some modern Antiquaries ; and by that time you have done So, you will deSpiSe your French Dancers : Or if you are averSe to the Greek, and Roman Performances of this kind, travel into Africa and Afei^ and there you will find Wonders worthy your Pen. Take a short Account of Some of them as I had it from a grave Citizen of London^ who alfur’d me that he himSelf had Seen it.
On the Coast of Guinea there are wonderful Fellows at this Art ; one in his Dancing shall So amuSe you, and deceive your Eyes in So strange a manner, that you believe you See him thrust himSelf through an Augerhole in a Tree Set there on purpoSe. Another, in his Dance, throws up a Ball of Packthread into the Air, and the the Thread mounts up after it quite out of fight. A third has a Fire made by the Stage where he dances, and has his Wife by him ; in his Dance he expresses hisUneafinels at her Tricks, and threatens to throw himSelf into the Fire ; accordingly he Seems to cut off his Legs one after another, and lastly his Head, throwing them into the Fire : But while the Speilators are gazing at this strange Astion, and the burning of his Limbs , he is Seen whole and Sound by the Stage laughing at the Company, and making ridiculous and apish Tricks at their Credulity. If you will go So far as
China,
( H5 )
China^ there you may See half a Score lusty Fellows stretching out a Piece of fine Shadow Muzlin , and then one or more jumping upon it, and dancing after their Way on it without breaking So much as a Thread of it.
But you will Say theSe are all Lies, and that my grave Citizen bubbled me into a Belief of his Romance by the Solemnity of his Countenance. As for that, I shall not Say much, nor will I defend his Narration as a Truth in all its Parts ; but it is agreed by most who have been in thoSe Places, that they perform Such un-*
accountable things, that our Europeans attribute it to the Devil, and the Black Art: But be it as it will, I had rather hear theSe Lies, than fee your Monfieurs caper. Therefore prithee trouble me no more with your Coupees and Riga--doons; if you lee any dancing Monk'^ys, Dogs, or Bears, pray let me rather have their Pane-gyricks for the future. I am, Sir,
Your humble Servants
Nic. Plainstep.
This Gentleman I find (Said the Baron') is Something of my Mind, though he carries his Averfion further than I do. I am So far for it, that I wou’d have Children taught, becatiSe it gives them a graceful Mien ; but, I confeSs, I cou’d never find any PleaSure in Seeing grown People dance. I am of your Mind, (Said the Chevalier ) and I never went to the Play-houSe when I Saw fdAhbe or Ballon\n the Bills. I know not, (Said I) but I must own I take a great deal
H	of
( )
\ •
of PleaSure in a fine Dancer; and the Family ibS the de JVFimfeys have been often great Proficients that way. As for my part, ( Said Down-right) though I am not for any French Kickshaws, yet I love a Country Dance ; it is Sociable , and a good ExerciSe 3 and requires not throwing away of So much of our Time to learn as the others.
LETTER V.
A.d.vice to a yotmg Gentleman^ who wm going
to turn Author.
It was direiled
To -Mr. Sprightly at his Chambers in the
Middle-Tempky London.
Dear Harry.
Receiv’d yours of the i8th Instant with a great steal of Satisfa6l:ion, becauSe it brought me the NeWs of your Recovery at a time when Distempers prove So mortal as they have of late.
But this is not the only News your Letter brings me, for you there inform me that you are Setting up for an Author. I wish your Luck may be equal to your Abilities, elSe I must tell you, that you will write in vain, either for Reputation or Profit. It is not Learning, it is not Wit, and thofe eminently join’d, that will do your BufineSs 3 Fortune has as large a share in this, as in any other particular PurSuit of Man s
List.
(147 )
Life. You run a great risk, for you stake all that Reputation that your ConverSation has gain’d you against the injudicious Approbation of -a giddy and ignorant People, wnoSe Fancy and Caprice are tneonly Guide of their CenSure, which is erroneous ten times for once it is in the right, and then it is the meer Effect of Chance too.
There are a great many Authors who have been Favourites of the Publick, whoSe real Merit cou’d not challenge two judicious Readers. A lucky Concurrence of Accidents often, nay generally, does the Work ; as violent Parties, the striking in with one may give SucceSs. To this Oldham ow’d what little Name he has. Scandal is another great Help ; for I have known an Author obScure and negle<sted for many Years, and th^ Contempt ev’n of the fixth Rate Scribbler^, who by boldly publishing Scandal has become a celebrated PerSon, and Set up a BookSeller by the Sale of his Works. If the Party you chooSe be undermost, it is ten to one but you have not only a Sufficient Number of Buyers, but numerous Defenders of your Merit, how indifferent Soever it may be in Reality 5 for it is So with both Parties, that all the Wit and fine Writing is of their fide. But theSe Works, and the Glory they gain you , is but tranfitory and mortal as yourSelf, nay often of a shorter Date, as dying with the preSent Heat.
Never think of growing popular by Wit, good SenSe, or Solid ReaSon ; there is a Bur-lefque Spirit that rules the Age, and a meny Buffoon is Sure to carry the Prize; a Tale of a
Ha-	Tvh
'V
( )
TiS Spreads immediately into every Corner of the Nation, and the Wicked and the Godly join to propagate its Sale.
If you delign any thing for the Stage ,' you mud remember to prepare its Reception by all the modern Arts which the Authors have found out who would be SucceSsful. You must make a Confident or two of Some leading Wits; you must make your court to the young Gentlemen of tneTown, shew ’em a DeScription, applaud their Judgment, and pay your Devoirs to the Ladies, eSpecially Such of them as have great Vifiting-Days, and frec[uent all the Assemblies of the rest of their Sex : If you can infinuate the Merit of your Performance by any publick Papers, it is of great uSe ; then when by your ObSequiouSnels to the Players, both Men and Women, it comes on, you must place Parties of your Friends in the Pit and first Gallery, who v/ill be Sure to begin Claps enough ; and this artfully manag’d, may do your Bufi-nefs, and establish you for a Dramatic Poet for the future. Yet you must not grow above ufing the Means that rais’d you, which must in fome degree be repeated every time you think fit to appear on the Stage with any thing new. But notwithstanding all theSe politick Pradlices, it is possible you may raifcarry, or meet with a cold Reception, and then you must in your Preface arraign the Judgment of the Town ; for though you are Satisfy’d in it when it gives you ApplauSe, though never So unmerited, yet you will never acquieSce in it when it condemns you. In the latter indeed you are more likely to be in the right ; for a thing must be very
.	execrably
(H9)
execrably bad indeed when they hiSs witli Just tice, that is in compariSon of what they approve.
I know there are Some Sanguine Gentlemen who flatter themielves with the AfSurance, that their Works will find that Justice from Posterity, waich the preient Age denies them. But this is built on a very Salle Foundation , that is, their real Merit and Excellence, and a vain Belief that Posterity will have more Judgment and Understanding than we have, and that what they write will ever reach Posterity.
That many Plays, and other Books likewiSe, which have not the good Luck to pleaSe, have yet far greater DeSert than the most taking, I grant to be true ; but I can See no ReaSon from, thence, that they will be more approv’d by thoSe who come after us, than by our Contemporaries, becaule I See no ProSpeifi: that they will know more of the Matter ; and we have Proofs from Experience, that we have not done So by our Predecessors : Mafinger is far a better Poet than Beaumont and Fletcher ; yet we find the Plays of the latter are printed and reprinted , while it is a difficult thing to meet with thoSe of the former. ’Tis true, the Dra-matick Poets of the foregoing Times were not worthy of that Name, as being at most but Dialogists", except the immortal Ben. Johnfon^ in Some of his Comedies : Yet on that Bottom Beaumont and Fletcher deServe the very least PraiSe, stnce they never defign’d a just Charaffer in their Serious Plays 3 their Kings are all Footmen , or of the Mob, and have nothing Royal : and their Women Seldom Modesty
H
3
enough
( IJO )
enough for a Whore in a Comedy. Talking with Mr. Dry den about the SucceSs of theSe two Poets, he told me, that they were first cry’d and help’d up by a Party , and Some of their Plays afterwards continu’d in Reputation on the Stage by the great A6lors that follow’d ; So that now they are receiv’d by Prescription ; and indeed it is pretty plain from this, that let us revive any of them, without Some new Helps, they will not be borne. Another ReaSon that thoSe Poems and Plays, as well as other Books, vvhich meet not witn immediate SucceSs, never can come to Posterity, is, that the preSent Book-Sellers, when they do not fell, condemn with the many, and Sell off the Remainder for Waste-Paper, or to Moor-jields^ where I have often met with more valuable Books than most that Set out the BookSellers Shops.
One Advice I had forgot, and which I learnt of a Poet, (as he is call’d) who has met with frequent SucceSs: For asking him what Rules he follow’d to pleafe the Town, as he had done, he frankly told me, no Rules at all, except what he had gather’d chiefly from the Rehearfal. That indeed, reply’d I, may furnish you with many just CriticiSms, cSpecially in a-voiding the Blunders of your Predeceffors. What CriticiSms in Art he may afford. Said he, I have never confider’d ; but I was of opinion, that he endeavour’d to ridicule nothing that Ivad not pleas’d the Town, concluded that what once pleas’d, might pleafe again, and So I choSe to imitate what you call Blunders, and I have Seldom miSs’d my Aim when I did So. And you may obServe, that the very Same Audience that
clap
c
(I5I)
clap at the Kehearfal^ clap likewiSe at thoSe'Pia}v; which have been ridicul’d in it. But you may Say, this wou’d be to make the People laugh at a Tragedy, which Seems not the Aim of that Sort oS Poem : Nay, if you are for moving Pity and Tears, you may meet with the Fate of a Friend of mine, who was condemn’d for having mov’d Tears from the BeRinnin" of hisTrage-
CD	^
dy to the End , and that by a celebrated Wit among the Ladies. I have known an Author, whilst all the Audience were in a loud Laugh-
CD
ter at hisTragedy, stand at the Stage-door and be as merry as they: Our Spe<stators are So fond of Mirth in theSe Representations, that they ar more willing to laugh than weep at Tragedy it-Self.
Thus it is plain, that it is with Authors as Hiffocrates wou’d have it with Phyficians, when he adviSes to chooSe one for his Fortune more than his Skill.
TheSe are a few of the Conliderations which I have on this Subjefl ; my Paper denies rtie Room for more ; and if theSe are not enough to stop your Pen, why write on as long as you can find BookSellers to print your Copies: I am Sure I shall be a Gainer by it, fince I shall then be able to enjoy you in your Books, when I cannot in PerSon. Pray Send me a Book I have
heard much of, call’d , The Complete Art of Poetry. If it anSwer the Title, and meet with Suc-ceSs, I have Some Hopes that our Posterity may be better Judges than we, and that they will have better Subjefls for their Judgment. Poetry is a Sort of wild uncultivated Region yet, quite over-run with Verfifyers and Poetasters ;
H 4	Regu-
Regularity may introduce Beauties, which we have Seldom leen in Britain. I am
Your fincere Friend and faithful Servanty
Hugh Jean,
This Gentleman has muster’d up (Said I) Such a Company of terrible Difficulties, that I fear he will rob us of a new Author in his Friend. Never fear that, (Said the Baron) for when a young Fellow has the Itch of Scribbling upon him , he is hardly cur’d till he has Scratch’d himSelf Sufficiently in Publiek to shew his Perfe6tion.
Mr. Sprightly (Said the Chevalier) may do as he pleaies ; but let him restefl, that as there is nothing more valuable than a good Writer, So there is nothing more deSpicable than a bad. For my part (Said Downright) I think we have Books enough already, and, as Solomon Says,
there is no end of writing of Bcofs.
N
Here is another Packet, (Said I) though not So big as the last : Shall I break it open, and read the Contents, or paSs on to the next ? By all means ( Said the Baron) read it in its turn, for I lik’d the last So well, that I am not frighted at the Bulk. On this I read the DireCiion, which was thus.

‘ T^Uring my late stay in Provence, I met
‘ with the following Letters in the Prc-
*	vencial Tongue, which pleas’d me So well,
‘ that I got the Permission of the Gentleman ‘ to whom they belong’d to tranScribe them,
*	and which I have now put into Latin, for
*	the Benefit of all thofe who do not under-‘ stand the Original.
'* Alphonfo the Wife (Says my Author) was
*	born to the abSolute Sovereignty of Provence, ‘ the’ with the Title only of Count or Earl; his
*	Administration was So just and equal, that
*	he might be Said to govern by Love, and
*	not Fear, or if his People felt aiiy Fear, it
*	was of offending against a Father.
‘ This admirable Justice of the Prince dif-‘ fus’d itSelf through all his Ministers, who
*	were Sure of his Favour, only as they dif-‘ charg’d their Duty with Impartiality and
*	UprightneSs.
* This Prince So belov’d at home, and So
*	deServing to be belov’d, was for the Fame ‘ of his Wisdom and Justice, as well as his ‘. Relation to the Kings of Cajiile and Aragon, ‘ call’d to thofe Thrones on the Death of the ‘ last Prince of a former Race, and So oblig’d
*	to leave Provence to the Administration of
his Brother, and Such other great Men as he thought fit to join with him in his Commission.
‘ There
6
i
(i57)
* There was a general Grief through all his Dominions, on his Departure from his native Country to go and take Pofiestion of his new Dignities; where he was not to meet with So loving a People, as unacquainted with his excellent Qualities and Virtues truly Royal. TheSe Kingdoms had been too long in the Hands of weak and irreSolute Pr inces, which had given Rife to great and dangerous Parties, and he w'as Sure which ever of them he choSe, he shou’d have the other his Enemy.
‘ He was advis’d not to distinguish himSeif in either, but to have his Ministers and Council mixt of both; but thoSe moderate Meafures were rejefled, either by the new King’s Opinion, that but one of them was stncerely in his Interest ; or, becauSe it was urg’d that a medly Ministry wou’d always be So clashing and thwarting each other, that the BustneSs of the State must be at a stand, and nothing but Confulion be at the Helm.
‘ Which of theSe two Constderations prevail’d, I dare not pretend to determine; but believe that the King was fixt in one Party by the most prudent and wife ReaSons. But having thus choSen, Alphonfo with the bravest ReSolution in the World kept to his Choice; which caus’d many Troubles, Tumults and Rebellions, all which he vanquish’d with Glory, and at last brought the nateful Distin6:ions which had So many Years divided the CafltUans to nothing ; and that Peace and Plenty that enSu’d, that Interest and Power he attain’d in all the Courts

of Spain and other Parts of Europe^ made the most fa£lioas of the CaJUUam own the BleS-ling which Providence had bestow’d on them in So wiSe and brave a Sovereign.
‘ But I have not much to do with his Political Excellencies, at least only with that Part of them which was found ev’n in his Amours; for it is certain that the Several Love Engagements that this Prince had, were not the bare Effefl of Constitution, but in Some MeaSure were influenc’d by political Confiderations; for by his Gallantries he got the good Word of the Ladies, who by this Means fancy’d themSelves not excluded entirely from his Thoughts. For I know not how it is, a King or other Sovereign Prince, who has no vifible Amours, is Sure to provoke the Malice of the Women, and Set them on inventing Scandals not So popular as a wiSe Prince would like. They wou’d repreSent him as a detested Slave to unnatural Lust, or barbarous, avaritious and cruel. Whether the natural Vanity of the Sex gives hopes to them all, of having a lucky Chance of being the happy Woman in her Turn, or that the great Men and Courtiers generally imitate their Lord, and So the Ladies find the Benefit of more freejuent Addreffes and Intrigues. And when a Court is that way inclin’d, the Mode takes away the Fear of the lost of Reputation.
‘ Be this as it will, Alphonfo by his Amours kept himlelf in the good Graces of the Female Sex, with whom he never engag’d So
* strong-
\
(i59>
strongly, as to be at the Command of any

‘ He was generous enough to thoSe he ' choSe, to leave the old one no CauSe to com-’ plain whenever he thought fit to make a ’ new- Choice; and that, with his great Dig-' nity, and the Charms of his Perion, made ’ it no difficult Matter for him to gain whom-ever he had a Mind to. He was inclining to be low of Stature, but his PerSon most agreeably turn’d, all his Limbs perfe£Ily propor-■ tion’d and strongly knit together,, his Coun-‘ tenance majestic, his Eyes awful, and yet ' full of SweetneSs ; So that he at once com-’ manded Veneration and Love 3 and indeed ‘ there were Such evident Lines of GoodneSs in ‘ his Face, that his very Enemies were not able to check their ReSpeft and Value for

‘ I shall not here mention all the Ladies ‘ who Successively were his Mistresses Of all ‘ of them Sacclimene had the Art of remaining

‘ Thus no*'« Was more obliging to the young Stremuma on her Advancement, or more forward to engage her Heart to the King, than Sacclimene ^ tho’ she afterwards repented of what she had done, finding her grow So much in Favour, that none before her had receiv’d Such Marks of Honour, Distinffion and Bounty, as this young MistreSs had done. She confider’d that Alfhonfo grew in Years, being past Fifty, and did not know but he might at last be wholly engroSs’d by a Lady that had So much Youth and Beauty
as Stremunia.
‘ She was not therefore idle in Seeking out Some other Lady to put in the King’s way, to break, at least divide his Inclination, which if she cou’d obtain, she did not fear but that his Passion wou’d Soon grow So
weak towards her, that she wou’d be no longer So dangerous a Rival.
‘ The CaJUlians^ tho’ fond enough of Strangers out of the Court, were yet always un-eaSy at their living in Power with their Prince ; and Alphonfo had all along, after his coming to the Crown, shown a particular FondneSs of Some of his Countrymen of Provence, perhaps more than was confistent with the Prudence of So wife a Prince ; nor had he yet admitted any CafUHan Lady to his Bo-Som. But Sacclimene, being destitute of Pro-vencial Beauties to promote, thought she might ingratiate herSelf with the Cajitlians, by advancing Some Beauty among them.

‘ This Count had found out a most perfedl Beauty, and one whoSe Accomplishments he did not doubt wou’d touch the King’s Heart; There was but one Obstacle, and that was, she was Daughter to one of the Party which were esteem’d the King’s Enemies ; but Ambition, and the Hopes of thoSe Advantages which attend a King’s MistreSs, stifled all other Thoughts in the young Lady, who cou’d be as zealous for Afhonfo, if Slie had the Benefit of it, as ever her Father had been against him.
‘ In short, the Count had her at one of his Entertainments, Set out with all Advantages that Art cou’d add to her natural Perfefbons. There the King Saw her, lik’d her, and determin’d to have her, if she cou’d be won by any reaSonable Means. That Task was left to the Count and Sacclimene, who, glad of the Office, Ibon fitted her for his Bed, by aS-fiiring a noble Settlement, and magnifying the King’s Bounty, and his perfbnal Excellencies. ^
‘ All this was tranfafled without the Knowledge or ev’n SuSpicion of the ^poor Srremu-

‘ The very Night of this fatal Interview, fire had a very ominous and troubleSome Dream, which made her Send the King the following Letter,

PArdon me, my most adorable Prince, that ‘ I dare intrude the Extravagance of my Passion into your buSy Hours ; if it be an Impertinence I shou’d not be guilty of, yet if you conssder me betray’d to this Offence by the violence of Love, you will not only forgive, but pity me. Alas ! were the Souls of Men half So tender as ours, I shou’d not need to make this Apology ; but Ambition governs there, and Love is not known. Ah! my King, that you were as great and unexampled in Love, as in all thoSe Royal Virtues, that make you the Admiration of all the other Sex, and the Idol of ours ! Then you wou’d feel thoSe Tortures and Agonies, that last Night tormented your poor Stremu-Oh ! Horror I I tremble but to think
nia.

of it again! ’tis true, it was but a Dream, and blessed be my Stars that it was no more; for had it been real, I shou’d^pot have had Life to have writ down my MiSery. Me-thought, oh God! far be the Omen, I thought, that whilst I had you in my Arms, in a Moment you vanish’d away, and left me embracing the empty Air. Imagine the Racks I was upon : In deSpair methought I
flew from my Bed, and wander’d distrasted
‘ to
(i^3)
to another Apartment in the Palace, and there I found you ! But how? Oh my King I In the Arms of another. DeSpair, Rage, Grief, with united Force made an Assault upon my Soul, that the Bands of Sleep eou’d not contain, but immediately burst in funder: And waking I found mySelf all in Tears, and So terrible an Agony, that I came not to mySelf perfectly in Some Hours. But oh, diSmal Night! when at last I fell again into a Slumber, the Same curSed Imar ges disturb’d me once more ; So that I gave the rest of the dark Hours to wakeful Pain, while my fearful Soul form’d direful Appre-henstons upon theSe empty Dreams. Oh! rather let me never steep again, than have any'more Such.
‘ Oh ! my adorable Prince, let your Good-neSs indulge the fond WeakneSs of your poor Sf^emmia^ lb far as to let her fee you this Morning, and with your destreable PreSence dissipate the Anxieties of my lovessck Mind ! But if the Tyranny of Bussnels deny me that, this Night is mine, and I beg you wou’d lengthen the Joy by coming as Soon as possible, ev’n tho’ you leave Something of State undone till to Morrow ; the Public will not Suffer ; but till I See you, your Strs-muma dies. *
* The Messenger brought Word, that the the King was So engag’d in BussneSs, tho’ lb early, ^ that he cou’d get no AnSwer ;, which gave her a fresh Alarm, ssnce her Messengers were not us’d to want Admittance, let the

Affairs of State be what they wou’d. However, she comforted herSelf that all would be well at Night, fince it was one of thoSe on which she us’d to have the King’s Company, and of which she had yet never fail’d. But she Sat up all the Night in expedlation of the wish’d-for Bleffing; but no Alfhonfo (W Sent. As Soon as she cou’d See, she writ him the following Letter.

LETTER VIII.
A H! cruel Prince! and cou’d you know ‘ that your Stremumds Soul was in Sorrow, and that on your Account too, and rob her of her only Comfort? Not give her one Moment, ev’n in the Night, when Bu-fineSs is no more, and all the Crowds of Courtiers befiege you no longer ? What not on that Night, which hitherto you have let me call my own, when I us’d to pofSefc you free from all the World, have you all my-Self? Oh! my cruel King, are you grown weary of your Stremuriia'^. are all her Charms wasted already ? is her Youth flown ? has hateful old Age and frightful Wrinkles furrow’d her Face already ? and do you love no more? or indeed, did you ever love me at all? That you have lov’d me I cannot doubt, for you told me So, and it was below Aphonfo to difSemble with his Slave; doubly his Slave, by Birth, and then by Love ! for oh!
‘ I love
( 1^5 )
I love you still, yes, to Distraflion love you; and if you have ceas’d to love me, there can be nothing So miSerable as Stremuma.
‘ But Sure it cannot be 5 my lovely Prince, my King, my Hero, cannot be So fickle. No, my Heart be at rest, he loves me still; his Royal Office oSren engages his Nights as well as Days, and this has rob’d me this one Night of my Soul’s Wish: The next dusky Hours will make me amends. Fly fast then glorious Sun, and come ye Shades and bring my Sun, that gives me Light, Heat, and Motion. Oh my dear King, cou’d you have Seen me last Night, beheld my Impatience, mark’d how every little NoiSe made my Heart bounce against my BoSom with a momentary Transport of Joy. Ha! there comes my Alfhonfo 11 cried often aloud; but no Al~ phonfo came! I told the Hours, counted all the Minutes, and hop’d, and figh’d, and wish’d in vain, ev’n all the livelong Night. Sleep fled my Eyes, nor did my Bed once know me till now the hated Sun appears again, to Show me, to point me out ray Mi-Sery. The Night Seem’d doubly long, and yet I wish’d it had not yet an End; for while that lasted, I fed mySelf with Hopes I yet shou’d See you. But now thost Hopes are dead, and black DeSpair affumes their Place ; yes, yes, my Prince, I languish, deSpair and die. Oh ! my dear Lord! my King! my Sovereign! the Sum of all my Joys, my Wishes and my Defires, take Pity upon your poor Stremuma.^ and by a Speedy Vifit prevent her Distraflion. Come, if it be but for one

Stremimia, as Soon as she had finish’d this Letter, Seal’d it up, and Sent it by her Favourite Maid Cloria, with a stri6l (dharge to deliver it into the King’s own Hand, and to mark his Countenance on the Reception.
‘ Gloria had liv’d with her Srom her Childhood, and was WitneSs to her most Secret Thoughts, and always employ’d by ,her in her most important Affairs. She was bold, and pushing, nor wou’d she be eafily denied. ‘ After two Hours she return’d to her Mif-treSs, who had waited for her with the laft Impatience, her stay having been much longer than it us’d to be on theSe Occalions.
* As Soon as she enter’d the Room in a Melancholy Manner; Well, cried Sfremmia^ how does my King? is he well? what ill News elSe can’st thou bring? for thy Sad Looks threaten me with no pleafing Message.
‘ The King (reply’d Gloria) is well, 1 Sup-poSe, for I have not been admitted to him. When I preSs’d it, Morat told me that the King was not stirring, but Spoke it with another Air, than he us’d to receive your MeS-fengers with. I propos’d to wait till he roSe: He with a Scornful Smile told me it wou’d be to no PurpoSe, for he was Sure the King wou’d not See me; that if I wou’d leave my Letter, he wou’d find a fit Time to deliver it. I wou’d not be put off, assuring him, that by your Order I was to give the
‘ Let-
( 1^7 )
Letter into his Majesty’s own Hands. That you will not, fair Clona^ this Day, Said he 5 1 dare not admit you, no nor your MistreSs neither, shou’d she come herSelf.
‘ .Dh! InSolence, interrupted	durst
the Slave behave himSelS in that Manner ! I will have him diSmiSs’d ! does he not know me, nor my Power with his Master?
‘ Alas 1 (Said Gloria with a Sigh) I fear that Power is at an End. You may be Sure, Madam, he knew what he did, and plainly told me that your Pride had met a Check: That the King had got a new MistreSs, and So turn’d fhort upon me, and went his Way. I thought mySelf oblig’d to make an Enquiry into this Affair, which I found was no Secret. They inform’d me, that what Morat had Said of a new MistreSs was certainly true; and the Report was, that she was a Cajlilian^ and that which was more Surprizing, the Daughter of one of that Party, which was look’d on as Enemies to the Royal CauSe. She was cried up as a most accomplish’d Beauty, and had ’ all the PraiSes given her, that Flattery pays ' to a riling Favourite.
‘ No more (cried out Stremumd) no more of thy hateful News! ’tis falSe! it can’t be true! it is impossible! ’tis forg’d to give me Pain by the Slave ,M<»^^i'and his Creatures ; but I shall revenge mySelf upon his daring
* InSolence. But you deliveFd not my Let-
* ter then? Not to the Kinsj, but to hfmaef who treated me with more Civility, and pro-
‘ mis’d to deliver it to him the first Minute ‘ he was admitted. I question’d him on this
‘ Re-

i
( I <58 )
‘ Report; he Said, he wish’d that there were
‘ no Grounds for it, but hop’d--------
‘ Hop’d! what did he hope ? Oh! Cloria^ ' What cou’d he hope of Comfort to me? ‘ That it was only (reply’d Cloria) a tranSent ‘ Piece of Gallantry, and that you still had ‘ his Heart 5 but be it as it wou’d, he wou’d ‘ omit nothing to procure an AnSwer, which ’ he wish’d might be Satisfaflory to you.
‘ No Cloria (cry’d Stremunla) nothing can be Satisfactory to me, when I have a Rival, that co,u’d take him from my Arms! I can’t bear the racking Thought 1 She run on in a most violent Passion, and throwing herSelf on the Bed, cry’d out, Oh ! ungrateful King ! and shed a Flood of Tears, beating her Breast,
‘ and tearing her lovely Locks.
‘ Cloria did all she cou’d to pacify her, and put her in Hopes that it was all falSe, that Morat was a malicious Fellow. But, Said she, Ifmael is not So, Ifmael wishes me well, and that there were not too much ground for the Report.
‘ Were it certain, Said Cloria,^ you cou’d not do more ; this Agony, this Passion is no Remedy ; it only diSorders you to no Purpofe; and shoii’d your Enemies know it, you cou’d not afford them a greater Triumph. Be-ssdes, it will difcompoSe your Charms, which you ought to heighten, to retrieve what you fuppoSe you have lost. Have Patience, and I will try again to Speak with the King, Sound him to the Bottom, and let him know the Tortures you feel for his Abfence, and the falfe Reports that are come to your Ears

‘ Sleep! (Said Stnmmid) no, thou has murder’d Sleep with thy Account of my miserable State! I care for no Beauty, lince my King is inconstant; I defir’d only to Seem
beautiful for him and to him-------Sleep! I
hate thee now, C/orw, to think I can Sleep on this News —- No, I shall Sleep no more, till Death cloSe my Eyes with an eternal Sleep.

Let Some other go on this diSagreeable Affair, I wish I had died rather than have been the first MefTenger of Such ill Tidings.
* After Ibme Time Spent in this Manner, Cla~ na prevail’d to Send another, which being done, she made uSe of all her Art to pacify her MistreSs’s Rage. About Noon a Letter was brought her from Sacclimene to the following PurpoSe.

LETTER IX.
From Sacclimene to the fair Stremunia,
Health.
T^HO’ I am alwviys watchful to do Stremu. ^	‘ nia Service, yet what I shall endea-
vour to do her now, I have not the Satisfaction to boast the Effe^l of my own good Will to her, but of the Commands of one whom we both, I hope, take Pleafure in obeying.
‘ You know, xa.itStremuma,^ that we are Slaves to our Prince, made for his Service, and his Pleafure 3 and that the Aflions of Princes are not to be too nicely examin’d, if at all 3 they are unaccountable 3 it is HappineSs enough that we can pleafe them, and still a greater that we can share their Favours. You mull: remember, {d.itStremuma., that you are a Courtier, bred in the Court from your Infancy, and shou’d not therefore be deceiv’d by other Notions, than which nothing can be more injurious to your HappineSs. Love is an agreeable AmuSement for a time 3 but to have that puling Paffion take up all our Thoughts, e-Specially when we once come to Woman’s Estate, is a WeakneSs, I hope, Stremmia is too much a Woman to be guilty of. Fidelity, Constancy, and the like, are the vain Daydreams of a Green-SickneSs Girl in a Country Village, and never rule in the Court, where
Passions of more ConSequence ought to reign 3
‘ the
(lyi)
the PurSuib-of Wealth and Power is what may last one all one’s Life, but the Love of Man cannot hold long ev’n with the most Romantick. There is no Such thing in Nature as a constant Man, much leSs a King. If you value the King, and wou’d always keep in his Favour, you should do as 1 have done 5 never make him uneafy about your Love; but if you find he will be wandring, never pine, or be out of Humour, but contribute to the promoting what he feems to defire, which will make Friendship ariSe out of the Ashes of dead Love, and that may hold as long as he lives. All Objefls loSe by a too familiar View j and believe me, dear St remum a	Sex
is not furnish’d with Variety enough always to furnish out an agreeable Feast as aMistreSs.. ' ’Tis true, if we cou’d feem amiable in our Lovers Eyes as long as we do in our own, our Empire wou’d be of a longer Date than it generally is ; nay, I am So fincere as to think it wou’d then be longer than we wou’d have it; for when we ceaSe to love ourSelves, Constancy in the Men is very troubleforae.
‘ Not to detain you longer in Sufpence, the King is a Man, a true Man in Love-Affairs ; Change is as much in his Nature, as in that of other Men ; and if the Charms of Stremu-nia cou’d not fix him, you have no Caufe ta envy your Successor, who must have leSs Beauty, and therefore reign a much shorter time.TheKing has order’d me to let you know, that he will always regard you, and that you may, if you will, always enjoy a large Share of his Favours, though he has choSen ano-
I a	* ther

ther MiflreSs at preSent. Bear yourSelf like a Woman ; and if you have any Girl-like Fond-neSs yet remaining after this Information, throw it away, or give it your Maid, like an old Gown out of Fashion. I wish you eafy and happy, which is wholly in your own Breast. Adieu.
‘ It was with great difficulty Stremuma went thro’ this Letter ; but the Concluiion struck her So to the Heart, that she fell into a Swoon, from which Clona had much ado to recover her j but she no Sooner was brought to her-Self, but she relaps’d, and that So often, that Cloria despair’d of her Life; So, calling for more Assistants, they got her into her Bed, where she lay all Night without Saying one word, but shedding abundance of Tears, and Sending forth lamentable Groans.
‘ This Agony by the Morning had cast her into a violent Fever, which, in Spight of all the Doifiors cou’d do, ev’ry Day increas’d, till her Life was deSpair’d of. Gloria found means to give the King an Account of all that had past ; and though he was vex’d at her Folly, yet he order’d all the Care that cou’d be taken to be employ’d in her Recovery : But upon a Motion , that his Majesty wou’d pay her a Visst, he rejefled it, Saying, That in his Opinion, that wou’d be to put her into a new Agony, and revive a Passion he hop’d expiring; as having begun from the Sudden-nels of the Change of her Fortune; for the King wou’d not attribute it to Love, as knowing
(i73)
in^ the great Distance oS their Age, but to Pride; and perhaps that was really at the Bottom ; Sor Stnmm'ux had given frequent Instances of her haughty Temper, So far as to have diSgusted many of the Ladies of the Court. At most, ’tis thought that her Pride was fo incorporated with her Love, that she took the Effects of that for this.
‘ After a Month’s SickneSs, she began to recover in her Health, but was not yet cur’d of her Passion for the King; which when she had got a little Strength, she made appear by the following Letters.
LETTER X
i
O ! my cruel King J
I Was in hopes, that before this time I ‘ shou’d have been at Rest in my Grave, beyond the Power of Kings, beyond the Power of yet a greater Tyrant LOVE: But, alas ! Fate has destin’d me to greater Evils yet; and I am doom’d to live ev’n when Life is lothfbm ; to love when I am hated ! to live without Comfort, without EaSe; in perpetual DiSquiets, in continual Wishes and Defires, without the least Dawn of Hope: Oh, most miserable Stremtmia ! thou hast no Refuge from thy Griefs! Hope, that vifits often the most wretched, will never come to
me ; never flatter me with fo much as empty and imaginary Joys to come: No, no, all my
I 3	‘ Plea-
( 174 )
PleaSures, all my Joys are gone, never more to return I I have been happy, ev’n to the Envy of the moll Fortunate, for I once was belov’d by Aifhonfo. Ah, no ! never truly lov’d by him ; that had rais’d my Condition above Mortality : Yet I thought I was truly lov’d by him, and that gave me TranSports, Raptures, ne’er to be forgot while Thought remains : But, ah ! why shou’d they not be forgot, lince the Memory of them aggravates my Milery ? My Pains, my preSent Agonies, wou’d be more tolerable, cou’d I bury in perpetual Oblivion the Thoughts that I nave been happy. Thou art most fortunate, Sac-clmene^ who cou’d part with Such a Royal Charmer without a Pans ! but she lov’d the Power, I the PerSon ; she lov’d the King, I Alfhonfo. Oh ! that he had not been a King, but Some faithful Shepherd in the Mountains piping to his Flock, unknowing the FalSe-neSs of Courts ; then might I still have been blest in his Arms. If, like Sacdimenemy PaS-fion were for Wealth and Dignity, I shou’d have no cauSe to complain ; your Love and your Bounty have all along prevented my Wishes, nay my Thoughts, which were never Set on any thing but yourSelf; If I had your Heart, I was rich enough, glorious enough, had Honours and Dignities Sufficient. But, alas I I wish’d aTreafure I never cou’d obtain ; or if I did, it was like .a Fairy TreaSure, short, fleeting, and like a Dream : Oh ! Dream Divine, thou art vanish’d ; and I wake to MiSery and DistreSs, to all the grinding Pains of a lasting Poverty, for Afhonfo has

‘ But, my King, how durst you take to your BoSom a profest Enemy ? My Prince, you are not Safe in her Arms, who may with So much EaSe destroy that precious Life on which the HappineSs of So many ThpuSands depends !

* This Letter she, by the Aflistance of Ifmael^ got convey’d to the King, but without any AnSwer, or the least Token of KindneSs on his Reception of it, or afterwards; which was no little Mortification to our Love-fick Lady ; who lov’d still, or fancy’d at least that she did So. However, she wou’d not yet give over writing, hoping that the Continuance of her Pastion, and her Sufferings, might in time have forae better effect on the King, quite mistaking his Temper ; for theSe amorous DiSquiets of Stremunta., too often giving him an unwelcome Disturbance, rather leffen’d

* T3E gone vain Memory of past Delights!
‘ why dost thou still purlue me ? Why, oh, cruel King ! will you not once fee the Wretch you have made ? Is it too much for you to grant one Moment’s Interval of Woe ? Do you fear that the Sight of me shou’d revive your former Love ? Ah ! fear not that, my Prince, I am not that Stremuma I was when I mov’d your Inclination ; all the RoSes of my Cheeks are faded, all dead and gone ; the Fire of my Eyes extinguish’d, and nothing but an Ashy PaleneSs covers my Countenance, SadneSs and Daily Sorrows deaden my Looks; you will find nothing that can move your Love, but Sure a great deal that may your Pity. Oh, how alter’d 1 oh, how chang’d from what I was when first I figh’d for Al-phonfo I Pain I felt then, but it was a Pain with Hope, finding, as I thought, frequent Regards from your Royal Eyes, that flatter’d me I was not indifferent to you : For, my King, I lov’d you before you let me know that 1 was not diSagreeable in your Sight.

What Credit theSe Secret Histories (afSum’d the Che-valier) may challenge, I do not know, yet they are always entertaining by their very Character. For my part (Said Downright) I am Such an Infidel to most Histories, that I can as eafily .believe theSe as any. Faith (Said!)

Againfi Witches.
Mr. De WhimSey, at his Houfe in the
Wild of Kent.
Dear Whim,
Cou’d not but Smile at your last Letter, which brought me the Account of the great Witch in your Neighbourhood; and your Complaint of the Justice, who refus’d to make her Mittimus, notwithstanding the many .Evidences against her. But I must applaud the Prudence and Justice of that Civil Magistrate, who, without doubt, was very well Satisfied, that there was no Such thing in Nature. And indeed, if there were, do I fee l^ow any Proof can be made of it, at least strong enough to bear either a Judge or Jury out before God for condemning of her. First, the Matter of the-Evidence that is commonly given against thofc unhappy poor Creatures, who are generally accufed as Witches, is monstrousty ridiculous, and very often impossible, as well as derogatory from the Goodnefs and Power of God. The ignorant accufe the ignorant, and often, nay always give Siich a Power to the Devil and his Deputies the Witches, as belongs only to the Deity. Thus they make them change their Shape, and most commonly into Cats,
I 6
( i8o)
tho’ the humane Body be So much larger than that of a Cat j they likewiSe make them paSs through a Key-hole, or a broken Pain of GlaSs, and Sometimes through Doors and Walls, without the least Inlet of ev’n a Crevice. Then they make them almost remove Mountains, whirl People from one Place to another, without any vifible Vehicle, and yet the poor Witches themfelves canst convey themSelves away from a Mob or a Constable. It is remarkable likewiSe, that we never hear of a Witch that is rich, they are all miSerably Poor and in a starving Condition, tho’ the Devil be Lord of Wealth. But you Say, that many People Swear pofitively in the CaSe of your Witch; and So they have in that of many others. But she makes People Spew Pins, Needles, and the like. Still this is no Proof, stnce Cheats of this Nature have been found out, as the Contrivances of others, and not the Effect of the Witch’s Power; as about the Year 1702, a Waterman in Southu'ark^wsis difcover’d by my Lord Chief Justice Holds Direflions, who accus’d a poor Washer-Woman of having bewitch’d him, and accordingly vomited crooked Pins, and the like. The reverend Mr. Martin then of St. Savioufs made the first step in the DiScovery; when the PerSon pretending to be bewitch’d, Icratch’d another Woman in the Dark, and thinking it to be her whom he accus’d, pretended to recover from his preSent Fit. This Imposture was carried So far, as to bring in the Woman’s Husband as a WitneSs against her, tho’ innocently enough in him, for he only Swore that she got up
every
(i8i)
every Morning by Four a-Clock, which she did to go to her Washing, tho’ it was urg’d by her AccuSers, that it was to go to her Diabolical Meetings. And had a Judge leSs circum-Spe£l than my Lord ChieS Justice Hoh heard the CauSe, it might have went hard with her 5 but by his Care the Imposture was found out, the poor Woman acquitted, and the Rogue
punish’d.
I know that thoSe who have written in the Affirmative of this Argument urge, that Several who have been executed for Witchcraft, have own’d their Guilt before their Death:. But I must reply, that theSe have been forc’d to it by the Tortures they have been put to 5 by the Same Means wou’d confeSs any thing, thinking Death the more eligible Evil, as putting an end to their excessive Pains here.
But they have own’d their nosturnal Meetings, and riding through the Air to adore and feast with the Devil, in the Shape of a Goat. But this might be the Effefl of a strong Imagination, and certainly was So, ssnce thoSe who have been strifUy watch’d the whole Night, and had Witnesses that they never stir’d out of the Place where they lay, have yet, when they wak’d, asserted the fame thing of their aerial Journey.
I have been inform’d, that in the HouSes of one of thefe reputed Witches in France^ there were Some Bottles of Ointment found, and the Phyficians of Paru guessing it to be of a Sort of intoxicating Nature, try’d the Experiment on two or three Malefaflors, that were condemn’d
to Death. They caus’d a good Fire to be
made,
( i82 )
made, and then the Malefa6Iors to be anointed all over with this Medicament. They first grew drowSy, and fell a-sseep, in which they ot up and run up and down the Room for ome time, and then fell all down on the Floor, and lay there till the Morning; when coming to themSelves, they told the Company that they had flown over Hills and Dales, had fed well with the Devil, and all the uSual Story of the Witches.
I remember when I was in Flanders^ I Saw one Witch burnt in this Manner: In the Market-Place there was erected a Scaffold or Stage, which being cover’d about a Foot deep with Sand, the Stake and Faggots were fixt on it j and a poor old decrepit Woman was bound to it, and burnt. The People had a thouSand Stories of what she had confefs’d by the Force of the Prelence of the Host, or Sacrament of the Eucharist 5 and that she had foretold, that all who Saw her Execution, shou’d be fill’d with Lice, and all the holy Water-Pots in the Town shou’d be fill’d with Blood, But nothing of this came to pafs, the poor Creature was Soon dead, and there was an end of that Sham. But the Popish Priests are fond of thefe Executions, and never fail of inventing-Stories enough, both of the Confessions and lying Wonders of theSe miserable Creatures.
What a Nolle was there about one Grandter an honest Priest of Lodm^ who was burnt in a Solemn Manner, for being a,Conjurer? The Nuns were taught their Tricks, which were various Distortions of the Body, in which
they
( i83 )
they at last arriv’d to a tolerable Perfe£lion, by the Instru£lion of their Father Confestbr, who was Grandtefs inveterate Enemy. TheSe Nuns accus’d this poor Priest as having bewitch’d them, and putting them in theSe (donvullions, whenever they were exorcis’d. This Piece of Malice was Secretly abetted by the Cardinal Kichelietiy who never forgave a Foe, nor miSs’d Some Way or other of being reveng’d upon him. This was Grandiefs Fate, and he at-last was, after a formal Trial, condemn’d and burnt for a Conjurer. There is a Book writteii upon this Subject, which I recommend to your reading j it is in Englijh.^ and is call’d, Thbe De-vils oj Lodun. That alone, I dare believe, will give you enough of this Affair of Witchcraft, if not, pray read Mr. Matherds ilccount of the Witches of Neu'-England^ which tho’ he publish’d to justify the Regency of that Place, (I mean the Judges in this Cafe) plainly poves, that they proceeded without Justice or ReaSon, as will appear from the Reply of one of the unhappy Woman who Suffer’d. It was Sworn against her, that she came in at a Window, and did Such and Such MiSchief to a young Woman in a certain Chamber. My Lords, Said the Suppos’d Witch, if my LikeneSs was Seen in this Manner, it must be the Devil who had taken my Shape, and well might he take my Shape who am a Sinner, stnee he cou’d fake that of Samuel a Prophet of the Lord at the Witch of Endofs.
The Judges made no material AnSwer to this Saying of the Crinvinal, but, in Spight of
that

9BC
■Vi
(184)
that and common SenSe, condemn’d her to be
burnt.
This had run So far at last, that they began to bring in Some of their Clergy, and then a stop was put to the MadneSs, and we heard no more of the Witches of New-Engiand.
But it wou’d be endleSs to purSue this Subject, fince the Impostures of this Kind have been very numerous, nay, as numerous as the PerSons who have Suffer’d for this Crime in all the Nations of the Earth.
I have not room for more j but if you are still for believing in this Pow’r of the Devil, enjoy your Fancy. I am
Your humble Servant^

Whether there are Witches or not (Said 1} that is, poor miSerable Creatures, who have Sold their Souls to the Devil, I think a DiS-pute not worth entring upon. It is however (astum’d the Baron) very strange, that the Devil, who has So much Gold at his command, shou’d let his Servant starve. Nay, (Said the ChexaUer') his Wages are So bad, that I fancy he will have but few Guests at his no£Iurnal Orgies, Why truly (concluded Doumrighf) the Re* ward of a good and religious Life ev’n here, is So very much preferable, that if there are any Witches, they must be look’d on as Ideots, and So ought to eScape Punishment here at

On Matrimony and Love.
fto Sir John Amorous, to be left at Wlfite’j Chocolate-HouSe in St. JamesVStreet, London.
My dear Knight^
Your Letter of the came not to my Hands till Yesterday, plSe you had Sooner heard from me on the Sub|etl: of yours, I mean on your intended Marriage : But I hope this may come time enough to be uleful to you ; for perhaps what I have to lay may staler your Re(olution,tho’ I confeSs,when once a young Fellow is Set on Wedlock or any other mad Frolick, it is in vain to think of reaSoning him out of it; for had he not shaken Hands with ReaSon, he wou’d never have entertain’d Such a ReSolution.
However, I shall fend you the Refleilions that have hitherto kept me out of that holy NooSe. Were I to realbn like a Politician, I confefs, 1 shou’d be as warm for it, as I am now against it; for the World must be peopled, and the Race of Mankind be kept up, which a gCr neral Celibacy wou’d in one Generation destroy. Not but the World might be peopled without Marriage, at least that Sort of Marriage in uSe in our Parts of Europe^ where one to one is curfedly confn^d^ as old Dryden has it.
And there are or have been Countries (as Sparta
for
for one) where all Copulations were lawSul, and. the Off-Spring taken for the Children of the. Public, and accordingly educated by the State. But theSe Customs are look’d upon as Heathen, and we are on the contrary oblig’d to be ty’d to one Wife till Death does m part. Terrible Words,my Friend,and hard Condition, which has no Regard to humane Frailty, and the ChangeableneSs of all . Mankind or both Sexes, who are this Day fond of what the next renders odious. Methinks the Legillators (many of whom feel the Hardship of the pre-fent CourSe) shou'd allow us at least a Year of Probation, to fee how our Tempers agree, which it is impossible to know, till living together discovers it. You come to your MiS-treSs, during your Courtship, gay and in good Humour yourSelf, and find her no leSs So, and Set off to all the Advantage that Art can add to Nature, which take my Word for it, my Friend, often gives the better half 5 but when Distance is remov’d, and you come to a cloSer and more constant View; when you are with her all the Day and every Day, nay and all the Night too, you will fee another Scene open, and all the Defers of Perfbn and Mind reveal themfelves in Such a Manner,that you are amaz’d how you cou’d have been So damnably deceiv’d,
But alas, there
^eat h can Jign your
Quietus. All you can hope for, is, that your Wife will (if she have Senfe) endeavour to deceive you still, and So make herSelf at least tolerable.
This Maxim you must always follow, to have an implicit Faith in your SpouSe’s Virtue,
let
as to take a Devil for an Angel.
( i8?‘
let her Condu6l be never So SuSpiclous, whict. puts me in mind of an excellent Song of my Friend Cheelfs, and which I Send you for jTbur Instrustion and Comfort.

Whom the Fair one "well deceives.

But the Fool that ivoiCd be knowing What the Fair one woud difguife^

So that Credulity, which- a prudent Man shou’d always avoid in the reft of the Condufl of his Life, is here the greatest: Prudence: Wretched State, my Friend, which has all its Support,or at least: all its Comfort built on a Folly.
Methinks Ihere find you making a great deal of bustle with Love! You tell me I know nothing of that divine Passion, nor give any Allowances to it. That Love makes all Things pleafant and eaSy, nay transporting. Pretty

They have indeed fill’d their Books with this Sort of Love, which confifls only in Talk ; and So unnatural, that a Spanifi Lady reading in them, found when the Lovers had gain’d an Interview with great Hazards and Difficulties,, she threw away the precious Time in Chit Chat, which she thought might be better employed, and more agreeably to the Nature of Love: They are got together, Said she, “tchat Occafion for talking ? implying this Truth, that the Love between the Sexes was Lust with a fbfter Name; and this was the Opinion of the Antients, as is plain frgm all they have written on this Subjeist.

fays Lucretim^ by that putting the Love of all Animals on the Same Bottom, the Defire of Copulation. The God of Love, the Latini call’d Cupid or Cupidoy which is Lust or the Defire of Enjoyment. And let our Ladies fay what they pleaSe, and put on what demure and Severe Airs they pleaSe, what they mean by L.ove is the fame. There was a rich Citizen’s young Daughter, who fell So much in Love with her Mufick-Master a Foreigner,that,to five his Daughter’s Life, the Father w'as content to
take
(ipl)
take him Sor his Son in Law, and accordingly made the Motion to him, and inform’d him of his Daughter’s Passion; and told him, when he found him declare against Marriage, that he Ihou’d have a very conssderable Fortune with her: On which the Musscian was So honourable as to let the old Gentleman know, that he cou’d not in Gratitude make So ill a Return to the young Lady as to marry her, ssnce he had the Misfortune of being incapable of performing the Duty of a Husband.
Care was taken to convey this to the amorous Lady, who, notwithstanding the violence of her Love for him, cou’d not reSolve to wed only the Piflure or Image of a Man, and So in a little Time came to herSelf, and has ssnce married a more Substantial Husband.
Now, my Friend, had Love been what theSe whimsscal PerSons make of it, Something different from the Joys of the Marriage Bed, she might have perSevered in her Passion for the Fiddler, ssnce he cou’d talk to her, ssng to her, fiddle to her, nay, and kiSs her too, as eagerly as any other Man cou’d. From hence I draw this Truth, that you have a strong Dessre of enjoying your MistreSs; no more my dear Knight, which when Sufficiently Satisfied, she will have no more Charms than the re^ have had in the Same Circumstances ; but you cannot get So eassly rid of her when you are weary, and find nothing new in her PerSon or Mind. No, you must still have her in your Bo-Som, you must think of no other, much leSs give a looSe to your Appetite; you must eat of no other Dish, tho’ the finest Food in the
World
(Ipi)
World were Set before you. Well, but you know yourSelf, you are constant by Nature, she ftas all you can defire, and you shall now change no more. I wish you may not flatter yourSelf with a Virtue that is not yours, at least, I am Sure you cannot be certain of it till you have try’d j and it is a terrible Experiment on yourSelf, to risk the HappineSs of your Life on a Chance, when it is ten to one you throw out. You have no great Reafon from your past Conducst, to hope for what you have never yet found. You have been in Love with accomplish’d Beauties, you have found them eafy and complaifant to your Defires, and yet you have chang’d; the next Face that you lik’d, extinguish’d your Flame with a new one ; but now you are grown constant, that is, in Imagination. Be it So; but are you Sure that she will be So too ? You know what Virgtl fays,

Do you think you shall find her always like and love you ? never admit any wand ’ring Thoughts, nor view any other Objedl: witn Defire? ne’er listen to the Flatteries of the young and the gay, who will be assiduous in their Addresses, take all Opportunities of plea* j fing her, be Slaves to her Will, while you are indifferent; and, becaufe your own, make ufe now of none of thole Endearments that firft engag’d her Heart to you? You no longer
* watch
( 193 )
watch the Motions of her Eyes, and thence catch the Occafion of obeying her, even before her Lips have pronounc’d her Commands ; you no longer gaze on her whole Hours with Transport, hear her Speak with Rapture, nor kiSs her with Fire; when you embrace her, your Heart does not bounce against your Breast, nor does your Soul mount up to your Eyes. All is calm and cold, Civility now takes the place of warm TranSport, which yet she finds in others ; and therefore concludes that you do her an Injury, and pay not that Tribute to her Charms which they still de-Serve. What’s the ConSequence of this but Revenge ? and what’s a Wife’s Revenge but Cuckoldom for the Husband ? If after all this you are bound obstinately for the Port of Matrimony, why un bon Foyage^ my dear Knight, a prosperous Gale and unruffled Seas attend you,' ’tis a long Voyage, and the Winds and Waves very fickle; your best way is to take her out of the Sea of Temptation, that wicked Town of London., where there are So many Pirates reSort, that at is ten to one if Some dos^not board your Pinnace. Go down into North-Wales, and there let her cure her poor Neighbours broken Shins and Scald Heads ; and So employ her Time more innocently, if not with So much Diverfion. I will not in-Sure your Cargo for all this Caution, yet it is the best I can give you.

him, and made a.Figure at Wilfs and in St, Steven's Chapel; but he had an old Father who minded not the PraiSes of his Son So much as to let him long enjoy the Place and Sort of Life that acquir’d them ; no, Mirabel was an Elder Brother, his Father old, and the keeping up of the Family was now his Duty. The old Gentleman gets him a Country Lady for a Wife, with a good Fortune. Mirabel obeys this Call with Some Reluflance, but Necessity wdll have it So 3 his Opinion of the Sex gives him no great ProSpeft of PJeaSure and Happi-nefs in the holy State; but he relblv’d to arm the best he could against the worst Effe^s of an Evil he could not avoid. He leaves the Town, the Converfation of the Gay and the Witty, and retir’d into the Countr^itjmarry’d, and there has remain’d ever ssnce,[[>ajting no more notice of his Friends than if he had none 3 his only Company now is his Wife, his Children, his Books, and a Pipe of Tobacco; he is grown very religious. Says Prayers every Night to his Family, and wnth them goes constantly to Church. There’s your Example, Knight, follow it, and if it make you not very happy, it will keep you, perhaps, from being very miSerable; and that’s a pretty good hit, conssdering how the World goes, and the vain Cares which disturb Mankind. But all my Fears may be vain, and you may meet with a Lucretia. Yet Julius Cafar, with all his Accomplishments of Mind and PerSon, had the infamous Clodius found in his Houfe among
the Women, the Chief of whom was his
Wife.

In my Opinion (Said the Chevalier) ridiculing and railing at Institutions, that Spread through all Mankind, is no more a Proof of Wit than Honesty, but gives shrewd SuSpicions of both.

Virtue is the only Nobility, and be who boasts an old Family, boasts of another’s Merit, not his own. OviJy who was himSelf of the Equejirian Order, makes the wife UlyJJls Speak the Second Quotation. As for my Pedigree and Ancestors, and what I have not perform’d my-Self, I Scarce call them mine. For, indeed, what Merit can I boast, in having had one of my Family, Some hundreds of Years ago, who rais’d himSelf above the Level of the common People, by his own Actions, or his Prince’s Favour, if I do nothing my Self, to shew I deferve to be of his Race and share his Honours? This Antiquity of HouSe is a mere Ch'meray and peculiar indeed to none; for could we trace the poorest Wretch in the Parish to his Original, we might, perhaps, find a Prince or King of his Blood. We know that the Family of the illustrious Davids King of Ifrael^ was Sunk to a Carpenter, in the Husband of the holy Virgin Mother.

What was the first of the Arfadda but a poor Shepherd, and yet got to the Head of the ParthianSy and fettled their Empire in Such a manner as to maheit a Terror to the Romansy who were not able to revenge the Death of CraJJhsy and the LoSs of his whole Army, in many Years; for what Anthony did against them, was, at, most, but a Saving Gabie.
But our Gentryy out Distinftion of Gentle-
many Scarce ever had So teaSonable a Rife, nor So noble, as that of the Notniity of the Greeks and Romans. In thoSe Commonwealths it was either Some brave A(stion against the Enemy, or eminent Justice, Virtue or Ability, that rais’d one Man above another; Wealth had no Share in it. For Athens paid more Deference to Arijiides in extream Poverty, than to Callias with all his Riches, and whom they were about impeaching, for letting his Friend ArijUdes want when he abounded, and ow’d great Part of his Abundance to his Favour, during the Several Magistracies he had gone through in that City, without the least Profit to himSelf.
This was the way in thoSe Commonwealths; but I fear it will be a hard Matter for the
best
( 199 )
best of our old Families to prove their RiSe So honourable, under the KingvS, from which Fountain they derive their modern DiS-tinilion. I will not fay as ./Eneoi Sylxms (who was afterwards Pope Pm IV.) that most of the Nobility had been rais’d more for their Wickednefs than their Virtues, for Some had for their Founders Pimps, Court Parafites, usurers, and the like. He was a Man of the Family of the Picolhuomlni^ Sufficiently known to be of Figure in Italy.
But I would fain know of you who it is, that ever alks the C^estion, when a Man has a good Estate, whether he came in with the Conquest or not ? and who pay’d leSs ReSpe61: to Sir H. F. becaufe his Mother was an Apple Woman<? not one but a Coxcomb ; he was receiv’d and careSs’d by the greatest of our Quality and Statefmen, for he had perSonal Merit, by which he roSe, and render’d him-felf not only uSeful, but necessary to his Coun-* try in difficult Times.
I would not have you believe that I have one jot the worSe Opinion of mySelf, becaufe my great Grandfather, or his Father (for I am not So very learned in my Genealogy as to determine) was a poor Taylor in the Country near one Hundred Miles from London. No, 1 value him the more, who jumpt from-his Shop-board into the Arms of a coniiderable HeireSs, and So became a Gentleman ; his Son married a young Lady of one of the most ancient Families in thoSe Parts, and So confirm’d our Gentility ; but then my Father

toolc up with the Bastard of a certain wealthy Knight by an Herb Woman ; but having a good Fortune, and a great deal of Beauty, niarry’d her, and So produc’d your humble Servant.
You may, perhaps, mistake me, by what I have Said, for a meer Leveller.:, but none is farther from it. I am not for destroying Sub-9rd.mation, without which no Government can Subsist 3 but I am as far from thinking that this Subordination conlists in this Point of Antiquity of Family, and the contrary 3 but in the various Magistrates, their Substitutes, and the People governed. As for the other Part, which conlists in Rich and Poor, in thoSe who labour and thole who enjoy what they have without their perSonal working, that will always be; for the mutual Benefits they receive from each other, with the Demands of humane Life, will make themr always necessarily fubfist as long as there is Property, and this as fully, if there were no Gentleman of an antienter Date than this preSent Year, as if they had all Such antient Pedigrees, as would puzzle a German or Weljh Genealogist to trace them a thouSand Years a piece.
In short, this Pride of Birth is the Refuge of Idlenefs, of Sloth, and all manner of Bafe-neSs. Throw it away therefore, if you are wife, or would be thought lb 3 for it is contemptible in itSelf, and makes thoSe, who value it. So in the Eyes ©f all Men of common Senfe. If you had no other Merit than that
peculiar
( 201 )
peculiar to your own Peribn, I should be asham’d to Subicribe mySelS, as I do,
Your jnoji humble Servant
and hearty Friendy
HarryAllike.
This Gentleman (Said I) Sems to have too little a value for the Prerogative of great Birth. Not at all (reply’d Downright) you find he only fights against it as it stands Separately from all other Worth. No, (afSuhi’d the Chevalier) and that is a foveraign Truth that hinders not the Advantages that Birth gives, when join’d with other Merits. And that’s as much as can with ReaSon be requir’d (concluded the Baron) and it is to no Pur-poSe to strive for more in this Country ; in France and>^^m this Dofirine would be ipplv’d on as a Sort of an Herefy.

LETTER XVI.
of Benefit and Gratitude,
L’o Mr. Jeoffry PurSeproud, at his Houfe in
Cheap-fide, London.
~My good Friend Jeofifiy,
"^1^ OUR late Complaints of niy Ingratitude '*• to you, has given me Some UnealineSs, and made me reSolve to Send you this Letter, to remove So diSagreeable an Imputation. I am afraid that you do not Sufficiently know the Condition of Benefits; and that you will never be able to judge how far a Man proves grateful or ungrateful. I have not Seneca by me, who has written largely on this Subjeo",. So that I shall be content with what my own ReaSon Suggests. A Benefit^ to lay an Obligation on a Man, must, first of all, be just, that is, without Injury to any one; it must be done eafily, without long and tedious Solicitations 5 eafihy for there are a fort of Men, who may be wrought upon to do a Favour, and yet in the doing of it diScover Ib much Un-willingneSs and Chagrin, that it cannot be very much valu’d by the Receiver ; nay, I have known a Gentleman oblige his Friend more the manner of his Denial, than another
did at the Same time by granting his Request.
Witi>
( 203 )
Without: long Solicitations y for there are Other Men who do Favours, but make you pay Such an Extortion of attendant Dependance, So tedious a Sulpence between Hopes and Fears, that what they do at last makes not amends for the Trouble of obtaining it, and very often wears out the Benefit, by the Inconvenience which So long waiting for it brings with it: And this is the Method of Courtiers, where the Suitor has not Bribe enough to purchaSe a DiSpatch ; not but others likewiSe have the fame Vice, from a Love of Seeing a long Train daily attend their Levees ; but theSe are Men who have but little Claim to Gratitude.
There are Men too, rich Men like yourSelf, ^eojfryy who think they infinitely oblige, even when they lend Money on good Security, and lhall be vain enough to boast that they have oblig’d Mr. Such a one very much ; whereas every Money Scrivener and USurer has the Same Pretence.
There are Some who do real Benefits; but then they expert that the PerSon oblig’d Should be perpetually at their Command, think as they think, and do whatever they Sliall order thenr. But theSe, in my Mind, deServe leSs Gratitude than any, for they buy our Liberty, a Bleshng more valuable than Life ; they do for you, but it is that you ever after shall be their Slave.
Find me a Man that bestows a Favour freely, just w’hen it is wanted ; nay, that prevents your Demand, and then forgets the Good he
K 6	has
( 204 )
has done himSelf; or, if he remembers it, it is only in the Satisfadlion he has of having done a good or generous Action ; and not to pay all Acknowledgments to Such a one, is to be truly, that is, monstroussy ingrateful.
Titus QdtnBius Flamimus was one of this hind, who I took Such PleaSure in doing Good to others, that he thought himSelf oblig’d to the Man who receiv’d a Benefit from him; and he was an Enemy to none but Such as did reventhis Generofity by doing a Favour him-elf; for he thought that by that means he was rob’d of an Opportunity of exerting his darling (i^ality of Beneficence.
But alas ! there have been few great and powerful Men who have had his Temper, which makes him, to me, Seem the most valuable Chara6Ier in all the Raman History.
But of all Men there are none leSs fit for
•	* f
Friends or Benefadlors, than Scholars and Wits, especially Poets (I mean as they are now a days )■ it is a hard Matter to engage them at all; and yet more difficult to engage th^m to extend their Assistance, I mean, their Mediation (for they are Seldom qualified with Ability to be Benefaftors.in their own PerSons): whether it be out of Self-opinion that makes them think little of other People, or that they imagine a Small Matter, by their means, Sufficient for the greatest Distrefs. The Gown knows little of Generofity or Charity, or any. praSlical Virtue.
But to come to yourSelf, you will find you are not forgot in this List 3 you have lent
me
f	^
( *°5 )
nie Money, but not without Security; you may Say, perhaps, the Security is not So good but that you were fain to call in your Inclinations to Serve me to make you part with it. I will not contest that Point, for I hope your KindneSs for me had a Share in what you did ; however, I have not fail'd in my Payments, or in my ReSpeft for you. If you have heard otherwise, assure yourSelf I am highly injur’d by the Malice of the Reporter: for I am iincerely,
Yoy.r obliged
humble Servant,
Wl L L IA
T RUSTY.
There is, indeed (Said the Baron) no TaSk of humane Life more difficult than this of
r
Benefits. I confefs (assum’d the Chevdkr'), the want of confidering it well has rais’d more Complaints of Ingratitude than are just ; you fhall Scarce meet with a Man but has Suffer’d (if you believe him) by the Ingrateful. But that is only a Pretence to avoid doing Some Favour or other in his Power. Nay, I have a better Opinion (Said I) of Mankind, than to think that Vice fo general as ’tis made. How general it is (concluded Doivmight) I will not pretend to determine 3 but Sure I am, that a Man of any Figure and Conversation in the World will find too frequent Instances of it in all Degrees, and generally in them most who complain most of it.

( 207 )
Here is another Scene of Ingratitude (Said
the Baron') But one (afiSum’d the Chevalier) that is very .common in this wicked Age. As common as it is (Said Dou-nright) I think it de-Serves an adequate Punishment. That Affair is very little taken care of by our Legissators, who have been very hard upon the weaker Sex, and leave the guilty Man at Liberty to betray and ruin Hundreds, without So much as the Punishment of Scandal; for even the Women like a young Fellow never the worSe for having had a Bastard or two laid to him. That is but a poor Help (Said I) to the Woman, that her Oath will fix the Charge of the Child on the Man, which, for a little Money, he puts off to be starv’d ; but her Reputation is gone for ever. And this I take to be the CauSe of So many young Whores making Abortions, or murdering of them when born. In other Countries they have Receptacles of all the Byblows of the Place, where they are bred up and put to Trades, when big enough.

AIR Florella^ I know you expefl to hear Srom me in my AbSence, and I know that I ought to write: But what to write I confeSsl do not know; for to tell you that I love you, is what you know 5 to tell you that I long to poffeSs all your Beauties, I tell you no more than what you ealily believe, fince it is the natural ConSequence of my loving you ; But to tell you that I will always be constant, would be to fay what you will not with So little Difficulty give Credit to, or, perhaps, destre should be true 5 I shall therefore only Say, that I will be constant as long as you would have me So, and when you are willing that I should be no longer So, I will endeavour to change that Virtue for Some other that will be more agreeable to you at that Time. I could protest my Constancy should last as long as Life, that Streams should run back to their Springs, the Planets invert their CourSe and Ipoil the Mustek of the Spheres, the Moon ceafe to change, and a thouSand Such common Places of vulgar Lovers 3 but I fancy what I have Said will (if you are that Woman of Wit I take you to be} pleaSe you better.

And, perhaps (assum’d the Chevalier) takes a shorter Road to the Aim of his Defires, than by a whining AddreSs, especially, if the Lady be of a gay Temper. But (Said I) it often happens that theSe gay and airy Lasses are won with more Difficulty than the grave ones, who love to hear of the Power of their Eyes, and the Pangs they give their Adorers.

Here was young Ned Truant last Week, wh© was very lavish in your PraiSe, as of a fine young Gentleman, which I do not like; I had rasher it had been of a hopeful young Attorney: But confidering whom the Praife came from,, an idle young Rake, it gives me an Idea of your Condu£I, which I do by no
Means approve. A jine young Gentleman^ is, in
my SenSe, a fine ASs,^a Fellow that will never got, but Spend an Estate ; if you continue thus, I am reSolv’d you shan’t Spend mine, which has been got by great Industry, and other Maxims than thole of a.fine Gentlemari. In short, Tow, thou dost not Seem to know the World, thou must love no Man, no nor Woman, believe no Man, trust no Man, except on treble Security, do Service to no Man,, un-leSs thou can’st get by it thySelf. Mind not thy Bottle; or when thou dost drink, let it be with thy Clients,, and they will pay for it; study all the Cunning of thy Profession, and make thy own Benefit the wist Aim of all thy Adlions. Keep no poor Company, there is nothing to be got by that. Be no Peace-maker, that is against thy Interest; thou must live and grow rich by DiScord, not Amity. I Sent you
Orders
(2” )
Orders three Posts ago, to have that Scoundrel Barefive arrested ; instead of which you Send me word that he is poor, has not wherewithal to pay me, if in my debt, and that he fays he difeharg’d. what you demanded when I was last in Town. If he cannot produce my Acquittance, arrest him; if he canst pay me, let him rot in a Jayl, I know no Compassion in thefe Cafes ; in a PriSon, perhaps, he may find Some Fool or other that may pay my Debt, ssnee it is under forty Shillings. I therefore give you my posstive and repeated Order not to Ipare him,, as you will avoid the Anger of
Your loving Father^

LETTER IV.
Mr* Galliard, at his Houfe near Fever'
sham in Kent.
Ivly old Friend Galliard,
I Was not a little Surpriz’d at your last Letter to your Nephew, when he shew’d it to me. What I has the Kentijh Air quite chang’d you? Is all your gay Humour fled, and is your Blood all curdl’d with the aguish Temperament of the Soil you are retired to ? Nay, have ypu left your ReaSon at the Same time you left London^. But why all this Indignation at Plays ? Have you lately been reading Prynn^ and his Copyist of a contrary Kidney ? Tshe Inveflives against the Stage, which we have had in England^ have been given us first by a fort of mad Enthu-fiast, who at the Same time that he contemn’d the Fathers in all other religious DiSputes, builds all his Hijirhmajirix on their Autnority
misunderstood, and miSapply’d. The other great Enemy of the Drama^ is a most violent riacohite^ a Laudean in the highest Degree, who forgetting the Favour the Martyr^ and Archbishop Laud.^ with the most Celebrated of the Clergy of thoSe Times, bestow’d upon theSe Diverfions, joins Antimonarchical Prynn against them.
But it is no hard Matter to find the true ReaSon of the Rage of the latter against the
Theatre;
( 2 13 )
Theatre; Sor though he carry the Pace of Zeal for Religion in his Book, the real Caule was, by putting an end to Plays, to make the People uneaSy ; lince he knew what the ingenious Harrington obServ’d, that you wou’d in vain perSwade the People that they are free, while you depriv’d them of thoSe innocent Diver*-fions to which they were So inclin’d. And Collier thought that if Plays were in vogue in King William's Reign, it wou’d look to be on a Foot too pleafing for his Hopes.
1 cannot but Smile to See that his Book found So many Advocates, even of thoSe who most frequented the PiayhouSe, and who yet were every Night in the Boxes or the Pit. But we have a whimsteal Town. Well, what was the Event of all this Clamour ? Why, Collier got a great deal of Money by what he writ against Plays, and the Players got better Audiences.
1 cannot omit one Remark on his Book. He begins it with assuring us, that the Wit of Man cannot find out any Means more conducive to the promoting of Virtue, and the banishing of Vice, than the Drama; and yet at the End, he gives you a whole Crowd of the Fathers to prove that there should be no Such thing at all in a Christian Country ; that is, according to himSelf, that the Thing that is the most conducive to Virtue, which the Wit of Man could Invent, shou’d not be made uSe of to
that End.
\ *
But his Friends wou’d Salve this AbSurdity, by pretending that he is only against the Corruption of the Stage, and not against the Stage
itSelf.
( ^14 )
itSelf. If that be his Meaning, he had no need of transcribing the Fathers Authorities from Prynn ; nor is there any Man in his Sen-Ses who is against the Reformation of this Noble Diversson, except thoSe who get by its Corruption. But if that had been his real Intention, his Pen and Reputation were at that Time high enough to have accomplish’d So laudable a Defign ; a Delign So worthy of a Divine, and which has been long purSu’d in ■vain by Such who wanted his Interest.
I do not find by your Letter that you have started any new Complaints against the Stage, and all theSe have been Sufficiently anSwer’d already. To come therefore cloSe to you — VourNephew is a young Gentleman of the Inns of Court; he studies hard all the Day ; wou’d you allow him no unbending Hours, no Hours of Refreshment? That i s ridiculous, and humane Nature cannot Support itshlf always on the Bent. Well, you will; nay, you must therefore give him Diverfions : But are you for the most Innocent, or most Criminal 3 the most Idle and Vain, or the most USeful? If for the latter, let us examine all that this Town affords, and Some of which he must have recourSe to. The first is the Bottle: Do you prefer that to Plays ? I confefs a Bottle now and then, in a good Conversation, is very well, and very refreshing; but it is a hard matter to pick out Such Companions at the Tavern that make uSe of this Diverfion with Moderation ; one Bottle draws on another, till DrunkenneSs enSues with all its wild Train of Follies and Vices 5 and it is
a hard
(2*5
a hard matter for a young Man, of a .free and generous Temper, to obferve that Moderation in it as is requistte. Well, wou’d you have then quit the Tavern and go to the Gaming HouSes, even to the Groom Porter’s itSelf ? Sure you cannot be So mad as to approve of this Destruftion of Health and Estates ; the SeaSon of this vile Diverston is all the Night, or at least the most part of it; and when the Spirits are Spent with Vexation and Losses, and want of Rest, the Mind has but little Time to recover itSelf, and be fit for Study or Bufi-neSs. What CourSe must he then take, apply himSelf to the Ladies Conversation ? get in at their Assemblies, or their Vifiting-Days ? Alas! my Friend, a Man of SenSe (as your Nephew must be allow’d to be) makes but a ridiculous Figure among the Ladies 3 a Man must be fur-nilh’d with a large stock of Impertinence and Follies; must think little, and prate much, must be skill’d in the Tattle and Chitchat of the Place to render himlelf agreeable there. Beaus and Coxcombs will have a much better Interest in the Fair, notwithstanding all his real Merit, which will make him the Jest of the Women and their Favourite Fops.
There is another Sort of Diverfion with the Ladies, I confeSs, but Sure you are too grave to recommend that; and shou’d you, it wou’d take up too much of his Time, nay, and of his Money too, for a young Gentleman of his Estate ana Employment.
What other Diverfions there may be found
in this Town I do not know j but Sure I am,
that
( )
that theSe are the principal, and not one of them I think to compare vvi th Plays; in which you have an Image of Life, its Passions, and its Humours, that give us, whilst they divert us, most excellent Lessons, andTucIi as glide ;ently into the Heart in the Vehicle of Piea-ure. In Tragedy, you fee the ill Effefis of giving way to our Passions, which ought to be resssted in their first Approaches, if we Wou’d maintain our Innocence, and our Tranquility. By Seeing the Misfortunes which attend People of great Stations in the World, the Mind is brought to pity Objedls worthy of Compassion, and to become leSs liable to missead us in thoSe which in justice ought to engage it. It likewiSe regulates our Fear^ by having Such Things, Such Events plac’d before us, that while they cauSe Terror for them-felves, render us leSs Subjedl to it in the common Accidents of Life : But the Benefit of feeing Tragedies, that are well written, and well afted, are too many to he here enumerated.
In Comedy you have the droll Pieces of Poetry, the ridiculous Face of Nature, where Folly is laugh’d out of Countenance, and Virtue recommended with a Smile; the Singularities of Assedlation and Humour, (for they are not the Same, though confounded by a very ingenious Author in his DiScourSe of Comedy) the Disappointment of Vices not fit for Tragedy to take notice of, and the like.
TheSe were the Diverfions of the wiSest, the bravest, and most polite People that
Nature tver produced 3 I mean the Greeks and
the
(
due Rowans. Whoever knows the least of the
Athemansy know that no People ever excelTd them in Bravery, witneSs their beating So many Hundred ThouSand of the PerJianSy at the Battle of TAarathony under the Command of
Miluades. After the Victory was got, one of the Soldiers ran to Athens (not many Miles from the Field of Battle) in his Armour, not waiting till his Wounds were drest, and en-tring the City, knock’d at the Doors of Seve-
ral of the principal Citizens, crying out, Re-jok?,0 x\thenians, a/I is welly and So dropt down dead with his loSs of Blood, with a great deal of Satisfaction, that he had not only fought the Enemy, and had a Share in their Over-
throw, but had brought his Country the first News of the Victory 5 but he lost not all his Reward, the Athenians performing his Funeral Rites with great Solemnity.
TheSe were the People who were So delighted with Plays, who Sat whole Days in their Tlieatre, who wou’d on no condition iuf-
fer the Revenue appropriated to the Stage, to be applied to any other USes. TheSe People, who, tho’ the greatest Traders in the World in that Age, yet polish’d all the rest of the World by thofe Arts and Sciences, that had either their Beginning in that City, or their
Perfeaion.
For shame therefore, my old Friend, quit thy new astum’d and cynical WhimSy, and Suffer your Nephew to enjoy So rational a Choice of his Diverfion.	/
r
But

( )
But you will reply, That were our Stage like that oS Athens^ you should be as much for it, as you are against it. I confeSs, I wifh it were So; yet as bad as it is, it must be allow’d the best of our Diverssons.
Another Charge you give him, is, that he do not keep Company with the Players. I believe he has no need of that Caution, for I never found that he made any of them his Companions. But, good Sir, if a Gentleman, a Scholar, and a Man of Sobriety, happens to be a Player, shou’d that cut him off from our Conversation ? Certainly there is no manner of ReaSon. But my Letter is Swelled to a larger Bulk than I intended; therefore, with my humble Service, conclude that I am,
Sir, Your Sincere Friends
George Goodtaste.
I have always oblerv’d (Said the Baron) that the most noiSy against the Stage^ are thoSe who are the most liable to find themSelves there in Some ridiculous Shape of Folly or Vice, which is their real (ijuarrel to it. And have they not Reafon (assum’d the Chevalier) to be againft that which is against them ? How can they who thrive by Avarice, HypocriSy, and thf like, be pleaSed to fee thoSe Vices So graphically deScrib’d, that every one may know them when they meet with them in the World, though under never So grave and religious a Countenance.

Trufiy Friend Roger,

I Was pleas’d with your Zieal for Magna Char-ta in your last Letter, and must own it to be a great Happinefs to this Nation; and yer I must needs Say it is no Such Bulwark against Slavery as you imagine ; ITnce at the Same time that it wards So watchfully against the Invasions^ of our Properties and Rights by the Prince, it leaves us expos’d to worSe from one another. The Security of your Property is the Law ; but then the Prafiice of the Law is in fuch Hand?, that you are no longer fecure in the Poffestion of it than any one has a mind to disturb you,, who has Money to do it. The Lawyer, in the first place, never minds whether your CauSe be lust or unjust, provided he wants not his Fee; nor can you want Evidence who will Swear what you pieaSe, if you will pay them
La	for

( 220 )
1
for it, and the just-CauSe by this Means often loSes the Day, or is compelFd to have recourSe TO falSe Oaths likewiSc, to Support it Self. We have had eminent Proofs of this in WeK mhifier-Half where the Witnesses, whoSe Evidence past in a Trial the last Term, are all prov’d guilty of Perjury this. A roguisti Attorney forg’d a Bond for Three Hundred Pounds j the Execution of the Bond, and the Payment of the Said Money, was Sworn to by the Knights of the Post. The Gentleman conSulted his Lawyer what to do in the Cafe, who frankly told him, he had but one Way, and that the Same that his AdverSaries had taken, to acknowledge the Bond, but plead that it was diScharg’d, and provide Evidences enow to Swear it.^ He did lo, and carry’d his CauSe. Wshen the AdverSary heard it, Zounds, what a Rogue is this. Said he, to acknowledge the Receipt of Money which he never receiv’d or Saw ?
This is enough to shew how precarious a Tenure you hold your Property by, and how liableyou-are to loSe it in Spight of Magna Char-ta. You hold your Liberty in as flight a manner ; for if a money’dMan clap an Aftion on you, though you owe him nothing, he immediately destroys your Credit, and ten to one confines you to a Goal for want of Bail Sufficient; and if you have not Money, you may lie and starve there in expedlation of an Afi of Grace. Theie Things are done every Day; and I dare Siy, that Three Fourths of all the poor miserable PriSoners, in all our PriSons,
are
( 221 )
arc there either on this Account, or for Trisst Sj which they are not able to pay; and yet no Remedy has been obtain’d, notwithstanding the Grievance has more than once been represented to the Publick.
One great Source of part of this Evil is, that Perjury is not made Death 5 for were it So, the Rogues, who now' fear nothing, wou’d be deter’d from their Sw'earing by the Terror of the Gallow’s. I’he Manner of our Oath, and the Solemnity of if, is not Sastici-ent to strike many who take it. Pho, fays the Attorney to his Scrupulous Country Evidence, it is but kissing the Book, that’s all, you fay little or nothing. Which puts me in mind of a Story of a Scots Evidence, who by this Representation of the Lawyer who employ’d him, made no difficulty of kissing the Bock ; but when the Scots Oath was propos’d to him to take on the Same Point, he cry’d out, that he would not damn himSelf by taking that Sacred Oath to a Falshood ; for the Scots Oath is truly terrible, and pronounc’d with great Solemnity.
Add to this your Chancery Suits, which may hold you and your Heirs their Lives, and never come to a final Decifion as long as each Party can find Money to carry it on, till at last your whole contested Matter is Spent, and in the Lawyers Pockets, and you both fit down like a Couple of obstinate Coxcombs without a Penny.
More Instances might be given to prove that your boasted Liberty is a meer Chimera;
L 5	but
(

but I think theSe are Sufficient to make one Nation miSerable ; and the worst of it is, that there appears no manner of profpe£l of any End to it. It is true, that Some excellent Chancellors have ariSen, who have, during their Terms, cut off abundance of the dilatory AbuSes of that Court, as that excellent Per-lon the Lord Confer ; and we have all the Rea-Son in the World to hope the like from that illustrious PerSon who now has the Seals ; his Learning, his Humanity, native Equity, Virtue and Religion promiSe no leSs. But for the Tyrannies of the Court of the Marjhalfeay 8cc. I See no Help approaching. The MiSerable have few or no Friends; and the Op-preffors have hitherto met with too much Interest to fear a Suppression. And yet we find the Court of	fuppreSs’d for its
vile Practices. May the Marjhalfea meet the fame Fate; for none get by it but about Four Hundred Bum-Bailiffs and their Followers, Four principal Attorneys, bessdes Pettyfoggers and little Solicitors, half a Dozen CounSellors, &r. with the Jayler and his Turnkeys ; from whom, good Lord deliver every honest Man.

extends ; but this, I think, is pretty plain, that ionie are more filly and stupid, others more Sagacious and docile: So that the Animal Kingdorii riSes from Creatures that are but juft remov’d from the Earth they move on, or at least from the A^egetable Kingdom, which is only in IncreaSe and Decay, till it comes up to Men, and Some of them are Scarce a Remove from Beasts. What are all the numerous Part of Men, that make by many Degrees the greatest Bulk of the Kind, but, as Dry den calls them, a Scarce animated Clod, that are wholly employ’d (like the Beasts^ in Propagation and Nourishment? that is, in Manuring the Earth, and carrying on the under BustneSs of the World, that relates to Food and Raiment, in all its Several forts, or as Soldiers, or Traders, or Some Such Employment, which takes up all their Care, all their Study, all their Thoughts, and all their Time; who come into the World, and go out of it, without knowing or ever reflefting on what they are themSelves, or indeed what any of thoSe Things and Objefls are with which they are Surrounded, and ev’ry Day have to do.
Do not theSe differ as much from Man, endow’d with Knowledge, and the USe of Rea-fbn, as they do from Beasts ? Are there not Men in rhe World, who may be call’d a Sort of Gods to theie thoughtleis Animals of the Same Figure and Shape ? I mean Such whoSe So'uls riSe above the common Necessaries of Life, and mount to the Contemplation of the Heavens, and their Divine Author; that find by this Contemplation, that there is a Supreme
i minor-
( 225 )
immortal Being, from whom all vilible Things must of necessity derive theniSelves; who have thus discover’d that this Earth, they inhabit, is but a Point, a Mote in compariSon of the whole System of the Material World ; who, though their Bodies are confin’d to this Terraqueous Globe, travel with their Minds thro’ the vast ExpanSe, and take a View of the ineffable Wonders of Omnipotence there, find in this Journey Myriads of Worlds, all replenish’d with various Beings of a different Nature to themSelves. TheSe Men, who having found out the Several Motions of the Planets of our Vortex, with fo much certainty, as amounts to a Sort of infillible Knowledge ; theSe Men, I fay, may be allow’d of a fuperior Excellence to the groveling Creatures, which yTt bear the lame Name of Man,
To theie we may add all thoSe great Genius’s, who have either invented, or who excell in the other Arts and Sciences which have polish’d the World, and render’d that Life pleafing and defirable, which elSe wou’d be only tolerable, and little different from that of Brutes; that is, thofe who have invented, improv’d, or carry on the Arts of Building, Navigation, Arithmetick, and all the Mathe-inaticks, from wshich all the uSeful and finest Mcchanitk Arts are in Some manner deriv'd a Letters, Writing, Printing, PhiloSophy in all its ufeful Parts, Oratory, Mufick, Poetry, and the like.

the Great Vulgar, and the Small, as Cow-hy calls them. The Same will hold good in the Several Inclinations of Mankind, thoSe ■who are generous, beneficent, good, and a-dorn’d with all manner of Virtues, may be Said to differ more from thoSe who are led by the contrary Defe^Is and Vices, than Man from Beast.
There are Men in the World, who, like are or ought to be the Delight of Humankind; who have Such a Particle of the Divine Nature in their Minds, that they are never So well pleas’d, as when they are do-ing good to their Fellow-Creatures; who are, \\ke Arifftdes.^ incorruptly Just; like Ci»2o«, Generous ; like Flammimy Beneficent. ’Tis true, in theSemore degenerate Ages of the World,their Number is extreamly Small, at least who arrive to Such Perfeflion ; but the SmallneSs of the Number renders it the more Valuable, and challenges the more of our Esteem. Yet even now we may meet with private Men who take delight in Serving their Friends, helping the Unfortunate, and promoting Arts and Sciences. While, on the contrary, you meet with others that Seem made for the Destrudlion of all that is Good ; who take delight in MiSchief, and even glory in their AddreSs in Scandalous Irregularities and Inhumanity. Some Seem made by Nature for the Good and Benefit of Society, never Satisfied in Advantages that none shate in but themSelves ; others, vifibly born only for themSelves, care little who Suffer So they gain.

That what this Gentleman has obServ’d (Slid-the Chevalier) is most true, appears to me Self-evident. But this we may add, (affum’d the Baron) that the World pays not its Honours and ReSpedls according to this Divifion; for\ thoSe who generally meet with the most Suc-ceSs and ApplauSe too, are the Men iustly levell’d by this Gentleman with the Brutes ^ Men who have little or no Philanthropy, and efteeni all things made for themSelves. I con-feSs (Said I) Things are now in Such a State,, that there is Scarce HypocriSy wanted' to make the Wicked and the Fools go down with the Publick; not but Some diSguiSe Matters more plaufibly, and paSs for knowing and good Men, who are in reality extreamly ignorant, and

profligate to the last degree. The World (concluded Don-nright) may take its own CourSe; but with me a Blockhead fliall always be a Blockhead, tho’ garnish’d with all the Robes oS Science 3 and a Knave a Knave, though in Scarlet.
LETTER VII.
Eor Retirement.
Po fffr. Lovejoy, to he left Buttonh Coffee-Houfe in RuffeI-street, Covent-Garden, London.
*«
"My old Friend^
I Receiv’d your merry Letter by the last Post, and that shews me that you are the Same jovial Companion you haa^e always been. Company is your Delight still 3 your Bottle and your Friend have all your unbending Hours that you can Spare from the Ladies. I have nothing to-do to find fault with your Way of livings I have no Authority to dire<51: your Affions, and therefore it might Seem an assuming Impertinence for me to throw in my Reflections a-gainst thoSe Enjoyments you have still a Relish of: Yet, my Friend, methinks the IncreaSe of your Years shou’d now and then give you Some more Serious Thoughts 3 and I wonder, that for the Sake of Variety, (if no other Motive can prevail) you should not try the PleaSures
of
I
+
( 229 )
of Kenrement, The perpetual Hurry of Noife, and of BuIineSs and PleaSure, shou’d make you weary of the Town, and force you to wish for the calm Fields, the lonely Grotto’s, Woods, Rivers, and open Air. Believe me, as theSe wou’d be quite a new Scene to your Eyes, than what you daily See in that Smoaky Town of London.^ fo they wou’d open to you a new View of Plealures you are not yet acquainted with, I mean thofe of Contemplation, of the highest Flights of Thought, and all the SatiS-fafiory DiScoveries of Realbn.
For my Part, I cou’d find no fu’ch Charm in the PurSuits of a buSy Life, or a Life of Plea-fure, as they call it, to hold me longer in the Chace, perpetually the Same Things over and over again, with very little Variation.. However they have amus’d me in my younger Days, my Palate is quite alter’d with my Years. Mfi-thinks Man was made for fome nobler End, than to Spend all his Time, and employ all his Thoughts either in what they call BuIineSs, or in the little Toys they call PleaSures. Me-thinks he shou’d have Something elSe to entertain him than just how to laugh, and be merry, or play the Fool for Company Sake ; and you are a lucky Man if you can fix your Conversation Ib, as not to find more Folly than good SenSe in your Bottle-Friends ; and it is a wretched Repast to a Mind, that thinks justly, to have every Dish Savour’d with Folly and Impertinence.
In short, all the ConverSation, nay, almost all the Actions of the World Seem to me very
inlipid,


(230)
♦
iftfipid, and like the Tittle-Tattle of Women
and Children, which diSguft and not delight me. 1 think it is high time for me to look into my own Nature 3 examine for what CauSe I was made, and what I may expeft after this Short uneaSy Day of Life is at an End. I know Some of your Wits make short of that Enquiry, and dogmatically pronounce an End to all Things with Life. They tell us that after
Death nothing is., and nothing Death : And that therefore it is a foolish and Superfluous Trou-
ble to enquire into that which is nothing in itSelf, and yields in reality neither Fear nor Hope : That he is the wiSest Man who avoids all theSe anxious Confiderations, enjoys the preSent Hour, and all that Life affords, as long as he can, and then goes to steep for ever.
How theSe Gentlemen came to know this, I
confeSs, is what I cou’d never diScover. They have been too modest to back their Opinions with ReaSon, with Demonstration 3 for nothing leSs can justify their Conduct, and pofitive De-ciston of a Point of the utmost Importance, Such as the Immortality of the Soul is, if chey fliou’d be in the wrong. All that they have offer’d (for they Sometimes write, tho’wretchedly) amounts only at an endeavour at a meer Probability, encompaSs’d with Ten ThouSand Doubts. Whereas if they wou’d come up to their Pretenfions of being govern’d by ReaSon only, they should admit nothing, much leSs advance any thing but ReaSon that cannot be diSputed, in all their Declarations. Instead of this, when they find themSelves graveli’d in this
Argu-
!
C )
• < *
Argument, they turn it off with what they call Wit, or shrewd (^estions. Who ever Saw a Soul ? (Said one of them once in my Company) Set alide the fabulous Narrations of the Priests (continued he) and I never cou’d hear of any one Man of common SenSe and Honesty, who wou’d Serioussy avouch that he had ever feen a Soul or Spirit: So that as it goes out of the Body invistbly, it always remains So ; for what is the Obje£l: of our SenSes at any Time, is So at all Times, unleSs it change its Nature.
7	O
As for our Souls not being feen (reply’d my Friend) I know not what ConSequence you wou’d draw from it, unleSs it be that becauSe it is never Seen by our Eyes, therefore it has no Being; for, admitting what I know you hold, that there is nothing in Nature but Matter, yet we find many Bodies that are invifible to our Eyes, which yet evidently exist. As the Air and the Wind. What Body is of greater Force than the Wind ? It bears down all before it, and yet I never heard nor read of any one who Siw it. You wou’d not allow this as a good Argument against the Being of the Wind, and why then shou’d it be So against the Existence of the Humane Soul? Has not the MicroScope made Distoveries of almost an infinite Number of little Animals, which yet with our meer Sight we never See? Do we not find all Places and Things almost re-
o
plenish’d with Beings; and shall we be po-fitive that the vast Expanfe of Air is without any ? Do we know the Extent of the Power
of Omnipotence, and that God has no way of
ex-
( )
exerting his Omnipotence, but by Objc£ls vl-fible to our Eyes? But this is too filly to de-lerve ib much as has been Said about it. If therefore the Soul may be immortal; if a Part of this Creature Man Survives the Grave, Sure it is worth our while, nay, it is the Duty of common Prudence, and ev’n of Self-love rightly understood, to employ our Thoughts upon it, though but a meer Probability, nay, if only a Possibility. But God has himSelf assur’d us that the Soul is Immortal, and capable of Pains anst Plealures everlasting; and therefore it is MadneSs not to give our Selves up to a Contemplation of Death and its ConSequences, how to obtain the Good and avoid the Evil. But you will Say, I take it for granted that God has declar’d this, which is what they deny, and yet remains to be prov’d This has been So often prov’d, that it wou’d be but to repeat what has been Said to gain the Vi^lory, and filence theSe Tooh, who have Said in their Hearts there is no God. And the Subject wou’d be too large for this Place ; it may therefore Suffice to Siy, that fince the Points in Controversy betwixt the Atheists and Deists are of luch Importance, it is worth our while to examine thoroughly into them; and that cannot be better done than in Retirement, where, freed from all the daily Avocations of a Town Life, nothing may interrupt us in a Study truly as tranSporting as necessary To meditate on God, and his Works, to find out the Wonders of his Ways, and the like, assure your Self Sniy Frie»d^ are the only PleaSures
worthy

(233)
worthy a Rational Creature ; and theSe are what Retirement preSents you withal. MiS-take me not, I am not preaching up the Life of a Monkish RecluSe, against which I declare mySelf. Nor am I against the necessary Employments, which Humane Society requires, for that would be highly abSurd; but I only recommend this Retirement to you, and Such as you, who, having past through the buSy Part of Life, have left it to enjoy yourfelves as you call it, and reap the Benefit of thoSe Riches you have got together; for that is Seldom done till Years come on, and then it is high time to think of Some more valuable Riches, which, you have not yet obtain’d."
I do not deny but that you may do all this in Town; nay, and that you may meet there with Some Perlbns extreamly fit to help you in this new PurSuit, Men of great Learning and great Piety, both Clergy and Laity ; but they are Seldom Sought as long as we are pleas’d with the Laughers, the merry Fellows, the mighty Men at the Bottle, the Scandal Carriers, who gratify our Spleen and our Envy with malicious Chara6i:ers of their Acquaintance, and which is generally the common Subject of ConverSition in Coffee-HouSes, and thoSe of People, of the best Reception. Which puts me in mind of a young Gentleman that us’d Wiirs Coffee-HouSe, who complain’d of the Gravel, curfing that Place as the CauSe of it: And on enquiring how that produc’d Such an EsseD, Why^ Slid he, I ob-
ferv'd at mr Table (and Jo at the reji) the Perfon
that
A

(234)
that left the Company ‘woi always the SubjeB of our Raillery as foon as his Bac!^ was fum'd ; fo that to efcape this^ I generally out-fate the Company^ and would not fo much as go into the next Room to make Water^ for fear my CharaBer fhould he drawn he-fore my Returny which has given me the Gravel or Strangury^ I /(now not which, I laugh’d at his Fear of an Evil Tongue, and at him, for letting an imaginary Evil throw him into a real one.
I have not room to Say more, but that if you love not my Retirement, love, at least, my Study, enjoy that where you think fit; tho’, for the lake of your Conversation, I could wish you near me, where we would laugh Sometimes too 5 but it should be at the filly Creatures who never think, or never think as they ought.

Adaiw Due thought.
I was afraid (Said the Baron") at the Beginning, that we should have had an Harangue for Retirement, from the uSual Topicks of a Country Life. That, indeed (assum’d the Chevalier) is a Subjefl: fo threadbare, that the best that can be done on it, is to give us a good Transsation of Horace^ and the rest. As for this Gentleman’s Vindication of the Soul’s Immortality ((liid Downright) I approve of it; and I have often wonder’d what could move thoSe PerSons, who have appear’d against it, to declare for fo abandon’d a CauSe, that is,
why
( 235 )
why they should entertain and endeavour t© promote a Notion which affords no inanner of Benefit or PleaSure, either to themSelves, or any of Mankind, Can they be So stupid as to be pleas’d with Annihilation; Is to be no

Devils this Comfort, even in the MiSery of Hell, that they have yet a Being. I believe (Said I) that it would be no difficult Matter to prove that the Immortality of the Soul is declared by God, not only by Revelation (which cannot be deny’d) but by that Reafon which discovers to uS} that he hlmSelf has a Being.

LETTER VIII,
of Pride, Modefiji Vanity, dec.
To James Billville, Efq> near Maidston in
Kent.
Dear ^emtny,
I Was extremely pleas’d with your last, for I am never indififerent in my Friend’s Satif-fa£lion 3 his PleaSure and his Pain are Sure to find me a Sharer in them. I am glad you pafs your Time So agreeably in the Country ; this is indeed the SeaSon to find all the Diverfions of that in their Perfeflion. But you Seem to have entertain’d a ReSolution of fixing yourSelf at your Manor-houle, and of throwing off all Thoughts of this Town ; and think the PurSuit of the Fox, the Hare, the Chace of the Stag, and the Sports of the Gun and the Net, much more eligible, both for Innocence and Delight, than the Game we are So eager after here, I mean, of Wealth, Places, Dignities, Power, and the like. I confels that I believe I must allow you the Preference in Innocence; but as to the PleaSure, that is a Point that will admit of Some Debate, fince that depends on the Humour, Inclination and Passions of every Man, who having a different Taste of Things, must of conSequence have the Same of PleaSures: And Sure, a fair Stander-by would judge by
the
( m )
\
the EagerneSs of the PurSuir, that our Men of jBulineis, our Candidates for Power and Gaia have no common Satisfaflion to engage them So entirely and So perpetually in their Chace.
But you Say, you could never bring yourSelf to an Observance of all thoSe Requisttes that are necessary in Men who dessgn to make or mend their Fortunes; a stavish Attendance and Dependance, the shocking Pride and In-folence of Men of Power and Dignity, their Impertinence and Vanity, which must all be borne, and that with an Air of Content, if not Satisfadlion.
You fay, you could never bear dilguissng your Thoughts, and Sacrificing that little Knowledge you have to my Lord’s Ignorance, which yet you must do, or forego all your Pretenfions. It is, indeed, a hard Talk to a generous Mind, to fmother its Sentiments in deference to the Folly and Pride of another. I have Sometimes wonder’d why Men, that know themfelves Ignorant in any Arts, Ihould yet be So impertinent as to thrust their Notions into Conversation with Men of Skill in them, fince that is the way never to know more than they do. But this certainly proceeds from PrUe and Fanity^ which having been all along fed with Flattery from the Cradle, are grown So much a part of them, that they can never divest themfelves of them during their whole Lives.
It is a Saying of Some Author (I think Rochefoucault) that all Men are proud alike, tho’ they have a different way of showing it.
How
( ^38 )
How far this may hold good, in a very nice Speculation, I will not contend; but if we judge by the manner of Men’s showing of it, certainly that Maxim cannot be justified ; fince, as Some Men appear, in all they do, inSuffer-ably froud and vain ; So others, in all their
Conduil, discover a Modesty, nay, a Bashful-neSs which cannot be exculed, becauSe injurious to both their Fortune and Reputation. And this OV^’ro calls Pudor fuhrujiicus^ and is always accompanied w'ith a strange Diffidence in a Man’s Self. That which is most obServable, is, that this is Seen most in Men of the greatest Merit. No Body had more DeSert in his Art than Flrgif and yet he is noted for this exceSs of Modesty. This may be deriv’d from two Sources, Sometimes, perhaps, it may be the Child of what Seems its oppofite, P r i u e ; an over-rating of our own Merit, that expeds to be courted, to be fought to, am therefore dilHains to Seek after others for Reward or any manner of Benefit; and this more plainly in Some than in others. It may likewiSe proceed from Sloth, an inadive Temper, that cannot
be brought to bestow So much Pains as are ne-
And I
ceffary to gain a Point in this World, do believe, in Arts, eSpecially Poetry, it may come from the great Idea the Artist has of his Art, which maJces his best Performances Seem
lame and imperfed to him, at the Same time that they are admir’d by all Men befides ; and this was the CaSe of F/rgiA
I have made it my Observation, that the meanest Artists, the worst Poets have the
greatest
V

( 239
greatest Opinion of what they produce ; and are the most eafily flatter’d into InSolence, their Vanity heightning all they hear to their Advantage ; and often befpeak a Flattery by their own previous Praife of their Works to their Auditors.
Beauty and TKit are two things that most of both Sexes would be thought to have, and are therefore the Soonest won to credit what is Said to the Advantage of either. I once knew a Gentleman of Figure in this Town, whom one would have thought Nature had arm’d dgainst this WeakneSs, on account of his Beauty, who yet was more than once betray’d by the cunning Flattery of an artful Woman, to think himfelf a Beaux Garpn. His Head was in Shape Something like a Sugar-loaf, his Forehead long and Small rather than high, his Cheeks like a Trumpeter’s, a short Neck, narrow Shoulders, Hips and Buttocks like a Dutch Skipper, and his Legs short and doubly crooked. Yet, with all thefe Defedls, had no little Vanity in the Power of his PerSon with the Ladies, among whom one was found that thought it agreeable to her Interest to flatter him in that Particular, perfuading him not only that he was charming in her Eyes, but by feme pretty Songs to that Pur-pofe, quite difarm’d him of all Referve, and would in Raptures bring out, Ah! dangerous Swain j which was part of one of the Songs She had made upon him. It is common enough to find this I’olly eminent in an ugly Woman 5 but I never Saw it So strong in any
Man
( ^4^ )
Man before, who had So little to justify it. ’Tis true, that many of our dressing Fops are SufE-ciently hideous in their PerSons, and that thofe generally Set up for Conquests on the Women, who appear the worst qualify’d for it, if you abate Impertinence, tho’ that alone Sometimes is more SucceSsful than real Charms, than the GracefulneSs of Body and BrightneSs of Mind; for, as one maliciousty obServ’d, the Fair Sex love fhemSelves in them.
But I am wandring from my Point, and the Length of my Letter puts me in Mind that it is time to releaSe you from my Impertinence, and no longer detain you from your more agreeable Entertainments, like the rest of the World, Sacrificing more to my own Satisfaction than yours; for whilst I write to you, I Seem to converSe with you, than which there is no greater PleaSure to
Your faithful Friend
and humhle Servant^
William Willis.
It is true (Said I) it Seems to me that the Gentleman is in the right, when he makes Pride and Vanity the Portion of all Men, I allow you (assum’d the Chevalier') that every Man has Such a Share of them, that it is a hard matter to find one of us that is abSolute Pi’oof against Flattery, provided that'it be but adapted to our Gotft. Right, (Said the Baron)
for
(mi )
for I have Seen a Man reSent a groSs, ill-deli-ver’d piece of Adulation, and yet the Same PerSon Sufficiently taken with a clean Commendation, which yet had Scarce Justnest enough to Save it from that Name. For my Part (Said Downright') I think Funky no Such Evil, if it be not troubleSonie to others, fince it is a kind Remedy that Nature has planted in every one to keep him in Humour with him-felf.
LETTER IX.
Ou Tragedy.
to Mr. Johnlbn, to be left at Button^r Coffee-* houfe^ Govent-Garden, London.
"My Friend.
Am afraid you will think me negligent of the Favour of yours in delaying thus long my AnSwer; but a Man is to be a little excus’d, who has not been a Month in Parts^ where there are So many Things to entertain a Stranger: You Send me Word of a new Tra-ftdy that you have had at London^ and stem full of Admiration of the Poet’s Performance. If I did not know your Gothick. Taste of that Poem, I shou’d congratulate my Country on its Improvement in the DramUy at least in the noblest Part of it, Tragedy. But I know you think the Language the highest Perfection
M	of
( ^4^ )
of a Tragic Poet; and yet in that you and I shall never agree. Our Modern Writers of this Poem, I mean, Such as have excelPd moll in the Diistion, Seem to imitate the French in the . Time of Rapin^ of whom the Critic complains, as of the Destroyers of a true Poetic Stile, the Perfeffions of which are very different in all Languages from that of ProSe. T'here is more room for figurative Expressions; and a bold and strong Way of Speaking, justly manag’d, is beautitul in VerSe, which wou’d be Scarce pardonable in ProSe. There is no Man who has read the Latin Poets, and is acquainted with the Beauties of the ProSaic Diffion, but knows this. I confeSs, I wou’d not on a T'ryal of my Writing in the Latin Tongue appeal to moil of my Countrymen, whoSe Education has been entirely Englijh, for their Approbation. For our Schoolmasters here corrupt the Stile and the Taste of a young Student, by entring him in the Poets, before he has Settled his Stile in ProSe, which renders him incapable of dif-tinguishing between the two Modes of Ex-preshon, both beautiful in their Kind, and fe-parately, but abominable when join’d promif-cuoussy together. In Some Parts of Europe, they never let a Youth read a Line of Poetry till he is Master of the best ProSe Authors, and can write in the Stile of Cicero or SAujf as the Sub-ieff requires: I do not mean after the Manner of Fully's Orations (except where that diffufe Way is proper) but his Officer, his De SeneBuU, Amicitia, Paradoxes^ Sommmn Scipionis, and his
PhiloSophic Pieces, not forgetting his Epistles. When a Student is thus perfe<st and fixt in Profe,
they
( H3 )
they advance him to read the Poets, and then he likewiSc learns to Verlify, and not before. Nor does he begin with Virgil and Horace^ a« here, but proceeds from the eastest or least difficult to the hardest.
Tho’ perhaps this may not be thought of much Confequence to the EngliJJry yet take my Word for it, it is of more Importance than the general Talkers of Language imagine. And our Reformers of our Tragic Di^Iion wou’d not aim at bringing it to the Standard of the best ProSe, if they confider’d justly. I confeSs, I cou’d Sooner forgive Lee’s Fujiiany than the GoldneSs of the lat« ter. Milton.^ endeavouring to raiSe the Enghjh Poetry up to the Dignity of the Laun in Variety and Numbers, has recourSe to all the Privileges thofe Poets made uSe of to the Same End in their Speech. It is true, that the Imitation of Milton's Manner of Expression in a Play, has made it nauSeous to good Judges; but that is, becauSe the Imitator did not dil-tinguish the difference between the Diflion of an Efic and Dramatic Poem ; whereas Milton himSelf, in his Samjon Agomfles.^ makes uSe of a Stile more agissant, and fitter for Dialogue and the Passions.
But indeed, to me this Seems a Point not to be meddled with in the PraiSe of a Tragedy^ lb far as to determine its Fate, and give it the Name of bad or good. The first thing we ought to confider, and the chief Thing too, is the Fahle or Plot. If that be well defign’d for the proving Some one important Morah it goes a great Way in deciding the Merit of the Piece. That is the Work of a Poet, and none
M z	but
( 244 )
biit a Master in the Tragic Art has ever yet been faultleSs in the drawing of it. This is the Orttogriifky of the future Building, and Defeffs in this unieilified are never mended in theSu-perstrutfure. We must next examine whether the Manners; that is, the Charadfers, of the BerSons introduc’d are well mark’d, that is, whether they are Sufficiently distinguish’d from ■one another ; and that the (Qualities we give them are neceffary to the Plot; for all that are not So, are faulty. Nor must you strive to make your principal Charafters Sovereignly virtuous and innocent, eSpecially if your Cataf-troche be unhappy, for the Innocent ought never to Suster on the Stage. There must be Some Defers always vistble in them, and thoSe the plain Effeifs of Some Passion which Seems implanted in their Chara£fer, and which from their first Appearance lets us See what Courfe they will take, which CourSe must produce their Misfortune. But then they must not be Scan-daloussy wicked ; that is as bad ; for no Pity is due to a Man, whoSe Life is directed by an habitual Courfe or Principle (if I may call it So) of infamous Vices. There are two Crimes which are never to be admitted in Tragedy, Cowardice in the Man, and want of Chast' ty in the Woman; in the last of which many of our Play-writers are abandondly guilty. Nor must there be :\r\y iiha^os^ Filia:nsthey shock us too much, and Seem redly out of the Cha^ raster of Humankind. But the Succefs of in Shakeiyear has made our other Writers run mad after Such like Charasters; nay, one proceeded So far, as to give his Play the Name
of
(245)
of The VilUin. This is a PraDice peculiar to our Stage, and unknown to the Antients and Moderns of all other Nations. The Sentiments are the next Thing that comes under our Reste£lion ; if they are the true .Effe<st of the Manners, that is, Such as the Passions and Inclinations that we See in the Chara6l:ers in-fpire, they are good, elSe abominable. I fear we too often err here in our most celebrated
Tragedies.
If tlaeSe are all Pood, I wou’d not fear to determine that the Tragedy is good, let the Difiion be what it will. 1 know it is urg’d by a very ingenious PerSon, that all thoSe Poets among the Ancients, who were eminent for the other Parts of this Poem, were alSo eminent for this. I allow it, but that will be of very little Advantage to the Fautors of fine Language (as they with Mr. Bays are pleas’d to call it) ssnce as they were exemplar in this, So were they in all the more essential Parts of Tragedy ; and therefore our Grammatical Critics do nothing, till they find one or more among them who excelSd in the Diflion, and not at all in the Fahle^ Manners and Seyiriumnts.
On the contrary, we may, from marks on this Head, be certain that there had been before his Time, if not then, likewife fome v/ho were defcflive in the Diflion, and yet valuable in the rest.
I have taken no Notice of the Unities of Astion, Time and Place, not that I think them Things indifferent, for on the contrary I ef-teem them Essentials; but becauSe I find that now our Poets begin to make Advances in that
M a	, Par-
(
Particular; and though we have few yet per-Se6I in it, yet we have reduc’d the extravagant Ramble in all three of them into a much nar' rower Compafs. In this City of Pafis^ the Poets are mOst exail in them, and indeed, in ail the other Parts of this Poem.
I know we have Some who contemn the French Tragedies^ but in my Opinion for want of Judgment and Taste. 1 confeSs, there is one Thing which has too much prevail’d, both at London and Paris ^ and that is your whining Scenes of Love. Majesty is the Cha-rafleristic of this Part of the Drama^ which is utterly destroy’d by Such Scenes.
Jdon hene convenimt nec in und Cede morantur
Jdajejiaf etr" Amor.	’
«
fays the Master of Love, OW; which I wonder a great Critic of our Nation did not conli-der when he look’d on Love as an Improvement of the Antient Tragedy. Bestdes, it Seems not to be Dramatic, becauSe it wants Aistion, which is an Effential; nor is it an eaSy Matter to reconcile theSe Scenes to that Modesty, of which a Woman of Figure ought to be MistreSs, especially if the Scene lie in Some of the hotter Climates, where the I.adies did not uSe to allow themSelves the Liberty of owning their Passions in So open a Manner, before they were either eSpous’d or marry’d. By this you will find that I am not for excluding Love from our Tragedies; but then it ought to Be between Man and Wife. Thus the Love of Jl-
cefiis in Earipides charms us, as well as that of
Plele-
( ^47 )
Helena in the Play of that Name, of the Same Poet. The Distreffes of married Love are highly moving and command our Pity ; the tedious Scenes of Lovers before Marriage provoke either our Indignation or Sleep.
But I have exceeded the Bounds of an EpiS-tle, and shall therefore conclude with the old AfSurance, of my being entirely
Yoar faithful Friend^
and humhle Servant^
Robert Grangoust.
Th is Gentletnan (Said I) I find is for a great Regularity in Plays, but does not conlider that our Poets are not very able to come up to that Standard. Nor wou’d our Audience (aS-fum’d Downright) bear it; we have been us’d to Such a latitudinarian Way, that we cannot relish any Thing regular. That is a vain Ex-cuSe (Said the Baron') of the Writers ; the French Stage was as irregular till the Time of Corneille., and that of Athens itSelf, till .FEfchylm, Sophocles and Euripides. This is the Same Pretence (Said the Chevalier') the Spanifo Poets made; whereas the great Wit Cervantes proves, that the most regular found the best Reception.

L E T T E R XII,
A Dramatic Poets Slavery.
To Mr. C. C. to be left at Hallh Coffee-Houfe, in the Play-Houfe Pajfage, in Dniry-Lane, London.
^ I R,
The Objeffions you made the other Night were So Surprizing, and the Play at that Time So much out of my Head, that I cou’d not preSently make a just Reply; but having llnce, at my LeiSure, confider’d their full Weight, I shall now, I question not, entirely remove them, and shew that they are wholly without Ground. Your first Obje^ion, at least the most material, was, that the first Afl had no Relation to the rest of the Play; which, if true, had indeed been of Force enough to have stifled my Endeavours for the afling it. But on a Review of it, I am amaz ’d fo
find fo nice a Judge, as Mr.-------railing an
Objeflion from nothing, or from reading with the extreamest Negle<st or Prejudice, which is below a Man of SenSe. For, Sir, if you will but recolleft yourSelf, you will find, that it is as clear as the Day at Noon, that the whole Fable or Plot depends entirely on that and that all the Incidents in the Play are produc’d Successively by it, as much as the Incidents of the lHas are
by the CLi^rrel betwixt Agamemnon and Achilles

( 2 )
les; and yet that has always been deServedly cf. teem’d the most just and complete Fable that ever was drawn. AriJiotU makes two Sorts of Fables, o«f, where the Incidents produce each other, as in the OedifU'S oS Sof>hocles; and the otfeer, when they naturally follow each other; but he with Justice and ReaSon makes the first the more Excellent. Now, Sir, the Fable of this Play happens (unluckily) to be of this better Sort. For the changing the Place of First Pre-fident (which is in the very opening of the Play) was abSolutely necestary to the producing the ill Treatment of ChAons by the Brutality of old Beaiimele., and by that the Pity of La Foy, and his Delire of marrying him to his only Child, whom till that Moment he had defign’d for young B^aumele; and this hafty Resolution of the Father, the stopping of the Daughter’s Love to young Beaumele ^ and the fatal Marriage, produc’d every other Incident ev’n to the Catastrophe j So that your Objeflion is So far from being true, that the whole Play is entirely built on the first Afi, which you were pleas’d to tell me was not of a Piece with the rest of the Play. The next Objeftion, as well as I can remember,fis. That there are Several good Hints of Pashons, which are not purSu’d. In Anfwer to this Affertion I must bring another, which is, that I am confident that there is not one, no not one Hint of Passion in the whole Play, but what I can prove to be purSu’d as far as Nature and the just Condu(st of the Play will fuffer; for , Sir,
you must know, that there really are certain
Limits and Bounds, in theSe Things,, which to
tranS
( 215I )
tranSgreSs, ev’n in a Line, Sometimes k mon-ftrous, and destroys all the Beauty oS the PaS-fion. If you had instanc’d in Particulars, I could have given a more particular Anfwer. However, I can obServe to you from this very Play Something on that Head, (I mean before I alter’d it) it was Mr. BredSy and Mr. C—’— Opinion, and that very justly, that after Renault had discover’d to Chalons, that young Beaumele was in his HouSe, I had pur-fu’d the Hint of the Passion (as you call it) and made him talk too much after the Knowledge of this, when the Nature of his Passion, and the Incident requir’d him to make haft in, to Seize him, and revenge his injur’d Honour. Another Obje6Iion is. That there arc in the
Play Several vulgar Expressions-------Tho’ this
be a Trifle Scarce worth taking Notice of, yet I will vouchsafe an Anfwer to it. First, I must alSure you, that I cannot find them out (at least in any of the new Part) tho’ I believe, without Vanity, I know as much of the various Proprieties of the Engliffj Language, as Ml any Body ; but, Sir, you must understand, that there are Several vulgar Words, which by their Pofition assume a Grandeur not naturally their own, as in All for Love^ (the Stile of which is the most True, Sublime, and Tragical of any in our Tongue) the Word Trim is not only a Vulgar, but a BurleSque Word, yet is exalted by the Pofition in theSe Lines.
But they fjall flnd'iiFll fell thefe hunted Lives
More dearlyy than yon trim Bands can hay.
But
■m
>t‘V
•'V

( i6i )
But allowing that the Words you have by a lingular Penetration discover’d in my Play, have not this happy Advantage, it ought to be no more an Objection to the a£ling mine, than it was to the ailing Perolla^ or Ihraimth.t the Diilion of which last wou’d make a Ca' Spew, {as the Saying is) yet the Pathos of the Story made it take. But there cannot in Nature be, a more moving and greater Dillrefs, than is in this very Play; which has never been read without drawing Tears from the Hearers. You further objeiled, that the Method taken to make Atne’ia innocent, Seem’d to
yon ford d---But Sir, I am confident, that on
Second Refleilions, you will find this Objefiion very weakly grounded. First, for the Incident itSelf, it is So well prepar’d, and thoSe concern’d in it make it So feazible, that there is not the least Difficulty in the effeiling it, which frees it from the Imputation of being forc’d ; next it has been on the Stage, in the great Otreay's Play of the Orphan., but loaded with far greater Difficulties : There Polydore is to deceive the Maid, and a waking Miftrefs; here the Maid is confederate, and the Wife asseep.
But there are Some Incidents, tho’ not without Fault, are very excuSable, becauSe they produce great Beauties; as the extravagant Passion of Cajialio in his Disappointment may, perhaps with Justice, be thought Something beyond Nature, and its CauSe; but then all the Subsequent Beauties of that Play depend entirely upon it, and therefore we ea fily forgive and overSee So beneficial a Peccadillo. As for
its
( 2^3 )
its being written in hast, and negligently, I constSs I know not how to anSwer it, becauSe it carries Such a latitudinarian Sweep, that it can’t bear a particular Reply j I inust have particular Objedions, to refute particularly.
Upon the whole, if Plays have been brought on, and approv’d by you the awful Judges, with ten Times the Faults, nay, with Faults that amounted to the groCfest AbSurdsties, and not one half of the Beauties; I hope I shall have the Justice from you, to let this Play have a public 'Pryal before you condemn it.

This Letter (Said Dou-nnght) shews what hard MeaSures a Gentleman is brought to, who will venture to write a Play. True (Said the Chevalier') the Pains and Labour of compofing the Piece are recompenc’d by the PleaSure; but when that is done, he must be mortify’d first, by Submitting it to a PerSon who knows nothing of the Matter. And then (faid the Baron) if he ef-cape that Shelf, risks the damning by Votes-as injudicious in the x\sting. I know this Play (faid I) it is The Fatal Dowry of Mafinger^ alter’d very much for the better ; and, tho’ it never appear’d on the Stage, is So moving, that I never heard it without Tears.

A common Mistake.
Mr. Bickyrfajf
’'^OUR Advice from JFllfSy in your Tatler •7 of the 20th, gave me the Satisfa£lion of finding you mortify’d for your quondam Favours to that Player you mention. Manly fays of my Lord PlaujibUy that he will praiSe the very Poets of the Age, whom no Body elfe will praiSe ; and I was really Surpriz’d to find the CenSor of the Age falling yet lower, and prai-fing the Players of the Age, whom no Body elSe will praiSe, except Setiiey in hopes, by their Favour, of exerting one of his admirable Qualities of Taylor, or Poet. I am glad however,
that
( 2^5
that the Folly of the Fellow has made you ca» pable of distinguishing betwixt the Buffoon and Coxcomb in him. As for his talking critically, and ufing the Terms of Art, I am Sure it must be as the Lady did the Word Ohjeene ; which she taking for a fine Word, when she firft heard it, apply’d it to every thing, as far as her Head-Dreis ; for I am Sure he knows no more of the Art of the Stage, or of any other Part of Poetry, than the Lady did of the Word Ob. fme. That he is now one, nay perhaps by his Addrefs the chief of the Managers of the Stage, is a Scandalous Truth, and that is the ReaSon the Town is furnish’d with Such wretched Plays 3 Men of Parts and Learning will not fubmit theirWritings'toSuch a Judge : Fortho’ an ignorant PerSon may, before this, have had the Management of the Theatre; yet a Man had better have to do with fimple plain Ignorance, than with an Ignorance that is Swell’d with a Smattering, or Opinion of Knowledge ; With the former the Force of Art and Nature may prevail; but here Conceit destroys the Tafte of Nature, and out of an Affedlation of ^ Judgment, throws him perpetually into the. Purfuit of Caprice. Michael Cervantes ^ .one of the greatest Wits of Spain^ attributes the Corruption of the Stage to the ignorant Management of the Players ; and as Soon as the Poet and State had left off the Care of that of A~ thens^ all Beauty and Decorum forSook it, as Arif— totle affures us. When you therefore find the Stage prefer’d by the Learned to PhiloSophy it-fdf, it is not any Stage under the Dirediion of Players j for there must be Confufion and Cor-
N	ruption.
( 2 66 )
ruption, bccaule Ignorance and private Gain will be there. Whatever Partiality, Favour, Oppression, Injustice, Treachery, and the like, there is in the greater World, I can assure you, the Miniature of it, the Stage, bears an exast Proportion to it in every Particular. There you See the Unworthy, the Impudent, the Trick-ihg thrive, wear Buskins, and govern momentary Kingdoms ; while modest Merit is thrown down and oppreSs’d, perhaps to the bringing in of a Message, though of more real Value than the Tid/e/ Monarch. There you shall find very worthy Gentlemen and Ladies quite turn’d out of the Affair, while others, by a very partial Injustice, are kept in, who have not half their
DeSert. There you shall find C-----at the Head
of the Ministry, and growing rich by the Plunder of the Underlings ; while Ben Jobn/on^ the best Comedian in the Nation, is an humble I)ependant, and content with a bare Salary; And there is honest Wdl Pierre, who has stood the Shock of So many Turns of State, So many itevolations^ and Tranfinigrations, without advancing beyond a Property-Man. Perhaps it may be the Providence of his good Genius, which has preServ’d him in that humble Station below Envy and above Contempt, equal to his unambitious Hopes ; while Mr. Bright^ being in a high Post, has been Subjedf to the' evil iSortunes of all great States, is fall’n into Banishment, and stroles about for a Living; and Mr. Doumsy who had been prime Minister to So many Buskin’d Monarchs, is thrown afide into a Penfion, which, like thoSe at Court, are not long well paid: Ahosferimt FdminaMontes,

But the Evils of this State were the more tolerable, did they extend no farther than itSelf; but by this means the Town is injur’d in their Diverfion, the best Plays are SuppreSs’d, the worst expos’d to Sibilation, just as the Caprice dr Interest engages this Judge and Manager. He had lately by him, as he told a Friend of mine, twenty Plays. Now how blind Chance Ihou’d dire£l him to choofc the good, and re-je£l: the bad, I can’t imagine ; unleSs he does like a French Governor, who understood no Law,and was yet by his Post oblig’d to hear Cau-fes, by the Decifion of the Dice 5 for having judicioufly heard both fides, he threw a Main betwixt the Plaintiff and Defendant, and to which ever the Dice gave it, he decided it, and with that SucceSs, that his Justice gain’d great Reputation. This Method, in the preSent Management of the Theatre, wou’d be of great uSe 5 for by it the Author had a Chance of SucceSs, and a Certainty of no AbuSe; it wou’d diSpatch a great deal of BufineSs in a little time, for a Man without reading the Play wou’d Soon decide the Author’s Fate, without having his Play garbled, and his Scenes transfer’d to shme Scfij’tion (to ufe an elegantWord of Mr. D’Ui^ys, proper enough in this place) of the Player. By this Means a valuable Jewel, lately brought to them by a Friend of mine, niight have had a Chance of obliging the Town with a noble Di-verlion. I mean, a Play written by and Fletcher^ and the immortal Shakefpear., in the Maturity of his Judgment, a few Years before he dy’d. A Piece So excellent, that a Gentleman, who is allow’d a Master of the Stage, tells
N z	me.
(' 2^8 )
me, that after reading it Seven times, it pleas’d and transported him, and that it is far beyond any of the Collegue Poets, and inferior to few of the other Poets which are in Print. There is infallible Proof that the Copy is genuine; yet this Rarity, this noble Piece of Antiquity, cannot make its way to the Stage, becauSe a PerSon that is concern’d in it, is a PerSon, who
of all PerSons Mr. C---does not approve. The
Reafon you shall have in my next, having here kept you too long, though the regulating this little Representative of the World is worthy the Care of a Cenfor, in my poor Opinion : Who am,

fum’d the ChevaHer) blit I will get one as Soon as I come to Londons on this Recommendation, The Doilor ( Said Downright) Seems to mistake the Defign of the Author, when he wishes he had Said more of the Enthufiafm of Poetry ; For he propofes Rules for regulating the Fancy, and informing the Judgment; but pretends not to teach a Genimy that must be born with the Poet, that is the Nature which Home# joins with Art to make a complete Bard, and with which therefore his Defign had nothing at all to do.

On little Sawny the Poet,
To Mr. SpJeenall at his Chambers in the
Inner’-TemPky Ijondton,
Dear Ned^
Have just receiv’d your Inve£Hve against little Sawny the Poet, with whom you feem very angry that he has, without Merit, gain’d the ApplauSe of the Town : But, my Friend, you Seem concern’d at what ought not to move you at all; for it is what daily happens, md ever has, as we find by the repeated (Complaints of the good Poets almost of all Ages. That you are in the wrong, is plain ; for either he has Merit, or he has not ; if he has, you injure him ; if he has not, you injure yourSelf to be uneaSy at a worthleSs Trifle. But prithee, dear
( 27'
Ned, envy him not So tranfitory a Satisfa£Hon as the Publick .\pplauSe, which is but of a Day ; for the Same Town often condemns the Creature of its own Praile, and leaves him to Oblivion or Contempt; So that if this be all that Sau'ny gets, ’fis nothing at all. But you Say he gets Money by it at a strange rate, nay far more than the best Writers ever got in So Small a time, and that he does not deServe, as being a iniSerly Sneaking Fellow. And does this raiSe your Anger ? Why, if he has not the Soul to uSe it, he gets nothing, according to that, Tam
indiget Avarui quod habet^ quam quod non hahet 5 the Mifer ‘wants 'what he has^ as 'well as what he has
not. I can’t find by all this, but that you are in reality iStiu’«ys Friend, and not Enemy ; you are angry with him that he is envious, malicious, a Mifer, and a Poetaster ; that is, you wou’d have him generous, free, candid, and a pod Poet; what Friend cou’d defire more for im, or wish him better? At worst it is no just CauSe of Anger 5 for if he be that Man you describe him, he has a Devil within him, always about him, that does and must perpetually plague and torment him, and needs not your CurSes to make him more wretched.
But after all, what if Sawny shou’d really have Merit at the Bottom ? You don’t like his PoeSy,nor do 1 much admire it: But what then ? that does not make him a Poetaster, But all Men of SenSe are of our Mind j that is very uncertain. That there are Men of Senfe that do not approve of his Poetical Performances, is true. Mr. Dryden himfelf lay under the fame
Disadvantage : Matt. Qiford^ the late Bishop of
N 4	Kochejher^
( *72 )
Koehejiery the late Duke of Buckingham, and Sir Charles Sidley, were Men of the first Rate of Wit* and they unanimoussy condemn’d, if not contemn’d him 3 yet Sure no Body now will deny him to be a Poet, and a very good Poet too. S:nvny is a young Man, and has a great deal of Time before him to improve his Learning and Judgment, in which his greatest DefefHies. He Seems not to want Fancy, but that Fancy wants Regulation. He is perhaps too ignorant of the Rul es of Art, and has given us a great deal of Stuff that will not stand the Ten: of a good Judge. Well, but you must confefs that in Mr. jyrydetfs Works there is a great deal of Rubbish, and that his latest Performances are his best. Take zw&y Cooler s-Hill, and a very few more thint{s from Sir dohn Denham, and what is there -worthy the Name of a Poet in his Works ? I might proceed to Some others, as Covdey in particular 3 take nwny h'ls Hymn to his Pinda-ricks , and Some Occafional Pieces , with his Fragment of the Davideis 3 and though he will always maintain the Charafler of a Man of Wit and Learning, I fear that of a Poet will be Scarce his due. Let Saivny therefore alone, let him go on, and if he never give us things better than he has done, why then he will vanish like a Flash in the Pan, and ne’er be thought on more : If he does ever give us a good Poem, why then we ought to forgive him all his bad ©nes.. This is the Opinion of, dear Ned,
Thy faithful Friend,
Indolent Easy.
( 273 )
I think ( Said Vsrwmri^tf) Mr. Eafy is in the right on’t, and that we ought not to condemn a young Man for Some ill Pieces of Poetry, provided there be any Prolpeil of better from him. Sa'ii^ny (affum’d the Chevalier') began at the wrong End, in writing Rules for others e’er he understood the Rules of Art him-felf; that is the Task of Judgment, and Years, lihe Athemans (Said the B<zro») never’ Suffer’d a Poet to bring a Play on the Stage till he was past Thirty; and, I think, that it wou’d be better if our young P ry were deny’d the Prefs till that Age at leash The Advice of Horace (Said I) shou’d be remember’d by them, . Nonum prematur in Annuniy and that wou’d Save
us a World of that	that now ’tis fill’di

LETTER
7%e Labour in vain, or Laws about
Marriage.
\
To Mr. Wedwoud, at his Chambers in Coney-Court in Gray VInn, London.
Dear Billy^
YOU have impos’d a difficult Talk on me, when you defire my Advice about your Choice of a Wife. ’Tis true, I have more Tears over my Head than you, and know Something more of Mankind ; yet I do assure you I confeSs my Incapacity of giving you Coun-lel which you may depend on in this Particular. It is a terrible Rifk we run when we marry, ssnce all the Content and HappineSs of our future Lives depend upon it, and yet, like Death, it Seems instituted by Nature; and the Reafon of humane Society is too strong to be laugh’d out of the World by our young Debauchees. There must be married Men, or all would be Confusson, or the Race ceafe to be. You must therefore conssder what you propoSe to yourSelf in a Wife, and then chuSe accordingly. Do you propoSe merely the Propagation of your Family, to keep up the HouSe of the JViduoud^s from your own Loins ? if So, be Sure you chuSe a Teemer, a Woman that is likely to make you a Father of a strong and lusty
I	Race.
( *75 )
Race. If you would have her to be your Friend and Companion of your CounSels, you must take care that she have SenSe, Prudence and good Humour, as well as Virtue. But, alas, few of the Sex are thus qualify’d, their Education is not directed to improve the Beauties of the Mind, and teach them the uSe of Reafon ; they are left to the Guidance of their Passions, and to the adorning of their PerSons; they are instructed in all the little Arts of captivating the heedleSs Hearts of Men, generally as ignorant as themSelves. We meet with no Cornelia s now-a-days, who instructed her Sons the Gracchi in Eloquence, and other manly Virtues; if a Wife prove a good HouSewife, and manage prudently, it is the height of a Man’s Expectation, and too few of them do even that.
This being the State of Matrimony at this Time, and this the Condition and C^hralissca-tions of the fair Sex, our Bussnefs is to make the best of a bad Market, and endeavour to chuSe a Woman who may give us the least DiS-quiet. This should make you avoid the choice of a very beautiful Lady; for, first, they are Seldom remarkable for good SenSe, and there can be no HappineSs with a Fool ; next they are generally proud, conceited, and unmanageable, and really believe that all the Flatteries of their Beauty give them every Perfection that their Adorers place in them in the height of their Defires ; and thirdly, it is to draw all the Fops in Town after you, in hopes of Opportunities with her. And you may.
N 6	know^
( )
% <«
Know, by your own Frailty, that multiplying Temptations is not the way to be always innocent, which holds still stronger in a young Woman, who has not that strength of ReaSon to defend her from the Subtle Infinua-taons of every agreeable Fellow, who makes iti his Bufinels to be {kill’d in all the most eaSy Approaches to the Fair, that may give him SucceSs. A young beautiful unexperienc’d Lady thinks not far enough to confider the ill.ConSequences of her Infidelity, being wholly. amus’d and taken up with the preSent Satif-fa^lion and Pleafure of an Intrigue, and too late finds the long Pains and Anxieties that attend a CauSe which Virtue does not direst; and if she ever reform, it is nor till your Peace and' Honour are destroy’d, which can never be restor’d. If, indeed, you can bare the Fate of a Cuckold with (ialmneSs, and carefs in your BoSom the Charmer that betrays you, you may chuSe a Wife for her Beauty. I have Seen a Man, who had the appearance of a Gentleman,, kept the best Company, and past for a PerSon of Some Confideration, who could, as the Town talk’d, even fee his dear Wife cornute him before his Face; and another, who,.to let<his Wife’s Gallants know when she yvould be at leiSure, declare in the publick Choeolate-HbuSe, that Such a Day he was engag’d' out of Town with a MistreSs, who, he.’believ’d, would not part with him till the next Morning, the poor Creature was So fond of him 5 and this was the Cue to his own L&. Loversy^to have recourSe to her without
Interruption.

«	J
Interruption. But both the Wretches made Profit of their Help-meet’s Prostitution, who, though beautiful in the Opinion of the Town, were yet thoroughly mercenary, and still’d in all the meretricious Arts of a common Trader. But, my Friend,. I am very fure this is not your Temper.
There have been and are other Husbandis who are lb bewitch’d with FondneSs of their Wives, that they cannot reSolve to reSent their Injuries; but, after a Ramble with Some Scoundrel, or, at least, Some Fop or other fbr a Week or a Month, receive them with Joy at their Return. Nor are you one of thefe, if I am not very much mistaken in your Notions of Things. I am fure nothing could render you more miSerable than Such a* Wife ; avoid therefore a beautiful Mate ; fiich a one may do well enough for a MistreSs to fatisfy a prefent Appetite. But assure yourfelf that the Saying of Dry den is perfebHy true in this ;
All ObjeBs l&fe hy too familiar Vievs,
The most Sparkling and amazing Beauty wears away by having her always before your Eyes; she affords nothing new, or, at least, not enough to render herSelf So always ; when you are admitted to all her Recesses, See her in all Conditions, feel her ill Humours, and-the like, the GbddeSs vanishes, and leaves only a peevish worthiest Creature behind. On the other Hand, a Woman, who is but very indifferent in her PerSon, grows, by Custom, agreeable,

( )
able, and, if she haveSenfe and good Humour, endears herSelf to you by Time, till you discover Charms in her worthy your Friendship, and which you did not, perhaps, expe£l, be-cauSe you judg’d by her Body, not her Mind. And it is, indeed, a difficult Matter, to thrust the Impressions made by the Appearance of a beautiful Figure out of our Councils, when we conSult about this Choice. But
I throw not my Advice away on Such as are drunk, or in a feverish Frenzy of the Blood, but offer it to one in his SenSes. If you are in love, it is too late to adviSe 5 Realbn has then fled the Field, and Passion rides in triumph, and will not be contradifted.
In short, let your Choice fall on one who is your Equal for Birth and Fortune, one that is truly religious and prudent, that is MistreSs of a complying Temper, not govern’d by Violence and denre of Rule; one who shall think you as you are, her Head, her Lord, and be ready to Submit to your Will in all reaSonable Things, for you must.be Sure to make your Sway eaSy and just.
If, after allthele Cautions, you miSs of that Happinefs you propos’d to yourSelf in Wedlock, it must be the fault of your falSe Judgment, in raissng your Expectation to Things that cannot be hop’d for from this State; or it is becauSe there is no perfeCI Happinefs in this Life, and you ought to bear the Conditions of Mortality with a Manly and ChriS-tlan Resolution.
I know
( 279 )
I know that the general Inqiuletudes of the niarry’d Life have made Some Men offer at Ways and Means of remedying the Evils of it; but I could never find any of them reasonable or capable of being reduc’d to Pra^ice. I have more than once heard, from both Sexes, that our Laws, on this Account, are defeflive, in confining Man and Wife together for Life ; and urge, that fince mutual Confent made the Union, the Same ought to put an End to it. Others are for having a Year’s Probation, before they enter into the fatal For better or vtorfe. But all thefe Things are meer Whimfeys, and would certainly not remove the Evil complain’d of.
Give me leave to tell you a Story I have read in a Book of Travels to this Pur-poSe. I will not be anSwerable for the Truth of the Fa£l, but I am very Sure that the Moral is just.
“ Among the many Iflands about Borneo^ “ there is one, Says my Author, of a pretty “ large Circumference, and very well peopled, “ call’d by the Natives Adrafti. The King of “ this Istand is in his Power abSolute, and his “ Will is the only Law of his Subjeists. There “ reign’d here, about a Century ago, one “ Aviejiiy which, interpreted, is the Father, “ which Name he gain’d from his Love of “ his People, whoSe Eafe and HappineSs was “ all his Study and his Care. There is a great “ Freedom of Conversation in Adrajii, and
“ the Manners of the Inhabitants are very

** near thoSe of our Part oI Eur<^e. Their “'Marriages are for Life, as Ours are, and'full “ of the Same Complaints and UnealineffeSi “ The good King was heartily troubled at ** the Consideration of this Evil, and Set him-“ Self to find out Some Remedy for it. Accor-“ dingly he confulted the wife Men of his Na-“ tion; and ordered every one to offer what he thought might be of ufe in this Affair. Upon the whole it was thought that a Year’is Probation, or a temporary Marriage, which the Couple might diffolve by mutual Con-“ Sent, attested before a Magistrate, were the “ only means of making that State more a-“ greeable. The First was first try’d, and the “ King’s Will promulgated, and put in Exe-“ cution with the utmost ExaflineSs. But,
“ alas, to no manner of PurpoSe, the Women eafily diffembled their ill Humours for* a Year ; and then being fix’d, prov’d more in-“ tolerable than if there had been no Such “ Tryal. Befides, this was but a lame Re-“ medy, fince it reach’d only thofe who were “ not marry’d already, which left the greatest ** part of the Sufferers in their former ill State.
The Second therefore was put in Execution, “ but to full as-little purpoSe, this being not the • “ proper Medicine for the Malady. Befidc's, “ it produc’d a tboufand ill ConSequences not “ forefeen, as a general Confufion 3 preSent “ Passions were the Ground of preSent Di-vorces; and theSe multiply’d to that De-“ gree, that all other Bufinefs of the Magi-“ strate was Set alide, to hear CauSes of this

nature ; and many Men marry’d the divorc’d WiSe,’ only to get into the Secrets of his Enemy’s Family. This was the Source of litigious Suits, and, in a little Time,, brought all into Confufion.
“ The good' King, troubled that all his Endeavours, in this Particular, had been but a meer Labour in vain 3 and that the Evil he (ought to cure was made worSe, and his Subje6Is more miSerable 3 he., reestablish’d the old Law again, and So it remains to this Day. He told his People that he had done all he could to make them happy, but he found that lay only in them-Selves 3 and that if they would grow wiSer, and regulate their Passions,, and more con-Sult their ReaSon in their Actions and Con-du6l of Life, they might be happy; if not., their MiSery lay at their own Doors, and not his.	-
The King, indeed, was in the right; and if the marry’d Couple would, they might be eaSy, at least, if not happy. If therefore you reColve to marry, reSolve to make your-felf eafy, be prudent yourfelf, and your Wife cannot make you uneaSy 3 for it is, in my Opinion, generally Speaking, the Man’s Fault,, who wants Prudence in his Condu.61:, that makes the Wife bad.

of Mujickf which preferable^ ours or that of
the Antients.
*To John Savage, Efn near Maidston in
Kent.
My good Friends
YOU impoSe a hard Talk upon me, and at a Time when I am not at leiSure to confult Such Books as are necessary on this Oc-
cafion. To decide the Question which is the
most
( 284 )
most preferable, the Mustek of the antlent Greeksy or that of our Times, a Man should have both before him; but we have nothing of the Antients, in that kind, left us, by which we may with exa^I Justice decide this Controversy. However, I shall go on Such probable Conje<stures as the Matter will afford ; and that is Sufficient for an Opinion which extends not beyond Curiostty. The wonderful Accounts of the Force of the Greek. Mustek would perSuade us that they ought to have the Preference in this, as well as in Painting, Poetry, Sculpture and Oratory.
For this Realbn, as well as others, I do venture to declare, that it is my Opinion that the Greeks excel!’d the Moderns in Mustek, at least, in the Vocal, if not Instrumental. Ifanc Voffiu6y in his admirable Book T>e Firibm Rythmf
stye Df PoemaSMn KM. eviden11^^^ the Advantage to be on the stde of the Antients, anfwering all the Argunaents that have been brought by the Moderns to the contrary; to him I therefore refer you. PandroUmy a learned Ttaliany and a very curious Enquirer into Antiquity, in his Book De Pebm inventis &‘ amtJJtSy will not allow the best of his Countrymen to merit the very Name of Mustcians, in Comparifon of the Greeks. Him alSo you may conSult on this Subjed for your full SatiS-faistion.
If Encouragement be the Life of Art, Pvlu-stek had never greater than in that wonderful Nation; it was reckon’d the Qualistcation of a Gentleman,nay,and of a Hero.- Thus	in
his
( i«5 )
his Alcejtii introduces Hercules himSelf linging at his Entertainment in the Palace of AdmetU'S.^ If we may credit the wonderful Effe£Is of Mustek, which are on Record, we may justly, give the Preference to the GreeJ{s^ no modern Mustek ever producing the like; particularly what we read of Timotheus^ in the Time of Alexander^ who by the Force of his Song rais’d and laid what Passions he pleas’d. Saxts-
Grammaticus indeed tells us of the like done
<
by a Gothick. Fidler; but that is look’d on all to be a meer Fable, Mustek never having been in that Perfection in thoSe Northern Parts; nor were that People ever fo remarkable for a fine Ear and Taste. Perhaps the stne Gusto of the Grecians might be mov’d easter, and transported at a Harmony which wou’d not have the Same EffeCl on a more inlenstble Generation. Their Passions were strong, and arry’d them on many Occastons beyond what they do the common Sort of Men; whether it were caus’d by the Climate, or by the Nature of their Government, which was free, for Example, a Courtezan of	whoSe Name,
if I mistake not, was Phryne^ was accus’d in a Capital Cafe, and the Faft prov’d Ib fully against her, that her Advocate us’d all his Arguments in vain to deliver her; which finding, he took off the Veil with which she was cover'd, and bid them condemn her if they cou’d. She was of So exquistte a Beauty, that the Judges were quite confounded, and taken Captive by her Charms to Such a degree, that
they acquitted her; which produc’d a Law,
that
( lU )
that no Criminal for the future should appear
bare-fac’d in the Court.
Tho* this may be look’d on as a WeakneSs, yet it is a Proof of the Force of the Passions in the Athenians; and indeed I have obServ’d, that thoSe People, who have the greatest Wit and Senfe, have alw:^s the strongell Passions.
This gave that Power to the Demagogues^ who, by their Oratory, and the fine Arts of PeiSuasson, cou’d,and frequently did carry their Point, by working on the Passions of the Athenians. The Athenians indeed were nice Observers of the Performances of Poetry, Mustek, Oratory, &c. and were Senstble of the least Slip of the Poet, Mustcian, &c. Thus when AmPiarus was Seen in the Tragedy of that Name to go into the Temple, and afterwards found to be elSewhere, they damn’d the Play, becauSe the Poet ha.d not taken care to bring him out again before their Eyes, And when Eunfides, in his Play of Bellerophon^ had made that Prince Speak in the Vindication of Avarice ; the whole Audience roSe up and interrupted the Action, till Euripides came out on the Stage, and destred them to have patience till they Saw how he punish’d him for what he had Said. This appeas’d them, and Bellerophon*s Punishment made them go away well Satisfy’d. The fame happen’d on Hip^o-:
litufs faying. My Tongue hasPuiorn^ hut my Mind is free; becauSe it Seem’d to encourage Equivocation in an Oath. But this reach’d all the Greeksy the Lacedemonians them Selves not excepted 3 for when Lyjander had taken Athens^
and
{ )
and it was debated whether that City shou’d be destroy’d, upon hearing Ibme VerSes out of the	that General Spar’d Athens, and
return’d Home.
After Nicias was routed in Stdly, and his Army almost destroy’d, many of the Soldiers fav’d their Lives only by repeating Some Ver-fes out of Eurifides.
But it would be endleSs to give all the Instances of this Kind which yet remain in HiS-tory ; thele are enow to shew the Genius and fire Taste of the People ; and where thoSe are join’d with Such Encouragement,it is impossible but that Mustek as well as Poetry, and the other fine Arts, must arrive at Perfeilion.
Mustek was a great Part of their Dramatick Entertainments, for the Chorus in their Tragedies was all Sung to Instruments, and Dancing 5 and what made it the more touching, was that the Poets then compos’d their own Mustek, and, if I am not mistaken, there was fcarce any Such thing as Instrumental Mustek without the Vocal; So that the Sounds being aflisted with the Words, prov’d more pathe-tick, and reach’d the Soul. Whether in the Odaum there were any Performances wholly Instrumental, I cannot remember, tho’ I am apt to think there were not from the very Name of the Place.
We have Vocal Mustek *tis true; but, as Ifaac Vofjtus obServes, more Regard is had by our CorapoSers to the Notes than to the Words ; nay, we find the most SenSeleSs Songs generally the best let; and, with the Masters Pardon.
V
( 288 )
don, I must Say it, we have had few of them remarkable for their Senfe and Understanding. Harry Pared indeed began to constder what he compos’d, and made his Notes always expreSs what the Poet defign’d ; he shew’d the Way, but I do not find that there has been any great ProgreSs made in it fince he dy’d. He indeed painted (if I may Say So) in Mustek, witneis his Frost-Scene, and Several other Parts of his Opera Mustek.
Thus have I in short given you my AnSwer to your C^estion,' Whether the modern or an-tient Mustek was most excellent: There is more to be Said of the modern Instruments, at least of the Violin; for we cannot diScover by thoSe which we find in the Bajjo Relievo’s any one among the Antients (except the Wind Instruments) that cou’d have the Length of Sound : That they had long Notes and short in their Mustek, is plain from their Poetry, which cou’d not elSe be poilibly expreSs’d. The Organ was of later Invention than the old Greeks^ and the Violin -is wholly modern. What might be Said on this Head is too large to come into a Letter; I shall defer that till we meet, and here SubScribe mySelf,
Your faithful Servant.^
P H I L. P H I L A N T I Q.V E.
Tho’ I am of this Gentleman’s Opinion (Said the Baron) yet J think if is one of thoSe. Points which cannot at this distance be decided.
( )
cided. It is in that Particular (continued, the Chevalier) like the DiSpute about their Painting : If we credit what Pliny and others tell us of Apelles^ Polignotus^ 'Zeuxis.^ and others, we must grant the Palm to the Greeks : If we look on thoSe Narrations to be fabulous, we cut off the Surest Foundation of their PraiSe and Preference. I think ('Said Downright ) theSe are idle and uSeleSs Enquiries, Since it is impossible, as Things stand, ever to come at the Truth. It is however certain (Said I) that our Vocal Mustek will admit of much Improvement, and very likely that they who study’d that So much, and had Such a Regard to it, should excel us, who mind the Words little, if at all.

Couf)
SINCE my coming to London^ I have heard Some News, which I believe will not be very agreeable to you ; but yet what you wou’d •willingly hear; for tho’ the Misfortunes of a Friend can never pleaSe us, yet we are delirous to know all that befalls them. Your old Playfellow, Mrs. Betty Aimhigh^ is married; but her Marriage was of fatal ConSequence to her Mother, I wish it may prove better to herSelf.
The old Lady you know was a constant Church Woman, and never miSs’d Morning nor Evening Prayers at the Abby, when fhe was in Health and able to go from her HouSe thither. But alas! I am afraid all this Devotion was meer outfide, the Effefl: of Custom, the Church Mustek being a Sort of Entertainment to her, and took up Some of her Hours which lay heavy on her Hands. I wou’d not willingly traduce the Dead, but the Event shew’d that the Bent of her Soul was to this World, and not to the next, stnee a Disappointment in her Destres cou’d make her guilty of Self-Murder. In short, the Matter is
thus;
( 291 )
thus: You know, that becauSe her Daughter
was a good Fortune, she was always for a Sonin-Law of Quality! no common Gentleman cou’d 20 down, for she thought-three hundred Pounds a Year deServ’d no lets than a Coronet. How many good Matches, which Mrs. Bniy might have had, did she Set afide ? At last a Valet-de-chambre, understanding the Arabiticn of both Mother and Daughter, in his Lord s AbSence out of Town, made uSe of his Coach and Equipage to paSs for a Man of (^ality, and carried the Imposture on So well, th-at he won the young Lady’s Heart, and the old one’s ConSent. They had not been married many Days, but the Truth was diScover’d, to the great Mortification of the Mother, tho’ not of the Daughter, who, tho’ diSappointed of her imagin’d Grandeur, yet lik’d the young Man fo well, that she Seem’d eaSy with her Lot. One Sunday when they were all going ta Church together, the old Lady pretended she had left her Prayer-Book at Home, and wou’d needs go back for it herSelf, bidding them goon, for she Wou’d not be long behind them. She return’d Home, and immediately hang’d herSelf 3 her Daughter finding she did not come, fent her Boy Home to (ee whether she were well or not, who brought back the fatal News. I need not tell you of the Daughter’s Trouble, lince you know she was perfetkiy dutiful, and lov’d • her Mother as much as the Indulgence Hie had always found from her deServ’d.
This Sin of Self-Murther I look upon as the Sin against the Holy-Ghost, fince the Sinner dies in the very Adi of Sin, and cannot there-
O z	for
V
( 2P2 )
fore repent, and without Repentance there can be no Remission.

One wou’d have thought that this MiScar-riage of Mrs. Betty Ihou’d have been a warning to her Sister, Mrs. O/ium; but it was not, her Youth, her Beauty, and the fame Chace of Quality run in her Head, tho’ her Fortune was but One ThouSand Pounds; but she had not better Luck than the other, a Barber took Lodgings by her, and past for a Knight, and So carried her. But Olivia us’d not that Moderation on the DiScovery, which her Sister had done. On the contrary, full of Revenge ssie runs away from him, and Surrenders herielf to a criminal Amour with a certain Nobleman, who had made Addresses to her before, but who was a married Man.
This is the ill Fortune of thele two young Ladies, I dare Say it never will be yours ; however, to avoid it, put an end to honest Ned\ Suit, and let me find you married when I come down into the Country.

POSTSCRIPT.
Your Sister has one from me this Post, and in,that you will find an Account of the Fate of our Coufin Biddy.
Pride is the Destruction of thoSe (Said the Baron) who have not the Art of managing of it with Some Caution. Pride (Said I) has been thought one of the best Prefervers of a Woman’s Honour. I am afraid (Said the Chevalier) that it is but a weak Defence of Virtue, that is borrow’d from our Vice and Folly. This young Lady (faid Downright) confirms me in the Opinion, that Women shou’d never have a greater Fortune than just to marry them fuitably to their Birth. , There is a Law against stealing an HeireSs, but that has Seldom had any great EffeCl; befides, I think it unreasonable, that a Man shou’d be hang’d for marrying any Woman with her own ConSent; and I do not See how any one can be married against her Will. I think it wou’d be much a better Law, if it were enaCIed that if a young Woman was married without the Conlent of her Relations, her Fortune shou’d go to her next Male Relation, and then few wou’d purSue an HeireSs only for her Money.

Dear Coufin,,
"^OUR S'ster has one from me by this Post about the ill Fortune of a Friend of yours, conSult her, and you’ll fee the Particulars, and I delire you wou’d communicate this to her. Your Coulin Biddy is married, the Manner Something out of the Way. You hnow that ssie has lately been perverted to Popery by the Arts of the Priests and the Means of a young Fellow, for whom Biddy had a more than ordinary Love, and whom at last she reSolv’d to take for her Husband: Larry Trujiy had laid long Siege in vain, not know-; ing her Attachment to this young Paf/Ji ; but Harry was an Heretic, and therefore had little hopes left him,but in her Maid, who was perfefl;-in his Interest, and inform’d him that her Mist treSs had a Defign of marrying the other privately, and that a Romifi Priest was to perform the Ceremony in the Night, for fear her Mother shou’d find it out, who, fince her turning her Religion, kept her very cloSe, nor Suffer’d any one to come near her. But what will not a young Woman do and contrive to CompaSs the Man she loves, eSpecially if she be oppos’d by her Relations ? She made her
Maid
( *95 )
Haid her Confident, becauSe she cou’d not carry on her Defign without her; and she betray’d the to Harryand Contriv’d Matters Ib as to admit him for the other Lover, and not to appoint the Priest to come ; his Shape, Stature, and Voice, at least in that WhiSper they were forc’d to make uSeof on this Occaiion, could not distinguish him Srom the other. He careSs’d her, and was as impatient as a young Fellow ules to be when he is in the Bedchamber oS his MistreSs, whom he lov’d, in the Night, and in the Dark. In short, no Priest came, the HouSe Doors were fasten’d up, and he cou’d not retreat if he wou’d: She was un-dreSs’d as having gone to Bed, to diSguiSe all to the Mother. He preSs’d, she faintly de-nied; but on his contracting himfelf with the expreSs Words of the Matrimony, in the Maid’s hearing, and Vows and Imprecations of marrying her the next Day ; all was agreed, and to Bed they went, and Ahi^dd withdrew.

How bufy (Said Downright) are theSe Popish EmifiSaries, in perverting our People to their Superstition? But (Said 1) chiefly among poor Women, weak, ignorant Girls j for none elfe will be missed by their Sophistry. If we loSe Ground (Said the Chevalier) among the Vulgar, we find the better Sort frequently coming over to us; and one Gentleman’s Family lost to Popery, is more Damage to its CauSe, than an hundred oS the Vulgar gain’d, and will in Time put an end to our Fears that way ; for when there are no Men of Estates to Support and harbour the Priests, they will ceaSe pur^ luing their Market here.. They are bold Men (concluded the Baron) who, notwithstanding that it is TreaSon to pervert a Protestant, dare yet So openly attempt it as they do ; but our Laws in that CaSe are So Seldom put in Execution, that they lost their Terror. The Su-edijh Law well executed woii’d be more effeistual.

You are a Man who-have known the Court, and may perhaps interpret this Riddle to me, for my Lord’s Behaviour Seems to me to be very enigmatick.. Is Merit really a Jest then ?

True, (assum’d the Chevalier^ it is a fort of Upbraiding him, ;or is a kind of Dun Sor a Right; whereas a true Courtier must never be told, that he has any Fault, and^perhaps the good Lord, who was here addreSs’d to, had no Merit himSelf, and then it was affronting him to pretend to any.

Dear Sir.,
Here encloSe my Letters to the Most Noble
-----—■ which contain the PropoSal we
us’d to talk of about the Establishing an Academy of Sciences here in London, much Supe-riour to that Set on Foot by the famous Cardinal Richelieu, as you will nnd on the PeruSal. For that extended no farther than the regulating and fixing the Standard of the French Tongue; this to History and all Arts and Sciences, which can polish the Mind,and bring in auSeful CourSe of Learning. I have this Post Sent the Sec[uel of theSe Letters to your Friend Mr. Wrrthy, who will let you have a Sight of them. When you have perus’d what I Send you, your Approbation will be extreamly agreeable to me, be-cauSe when I have that, I am Sure I have Rea-Scn of my - Side.

A Propofal for efiablijhing an Academy Royal
for Sciencein Seven Letters.
My Lord. ,
TH O’ the IllneSs I have lain under, has thus long defer’d my Satisfa£Hon in bringing this Defign in a more complete Form, than your Lordship has yet Seen it; yet, my Lord, it has been no Small Amends to me to find, that the Demonstration of what I pro-poSe was not more convincing of its Feazibi-lity, than my Application to your Lordship of its Accomplishment, to the Men of the best Judgment, to whom I have imparted both. For where there is a Soul capacious of great Defigns, and a Fortune able to keep it above the lower Aims.of private Interest, and a Zeal for its Country’s Good, evident on ev’ry Occafi-on, there can be no Obstacle great enough to op-poSe, nor Difficulty Sufficient to vanquish its Endeavours for the Service of the Public, especially in a Thing, which brings with it Advantages as great as the Glory ; where you refine the Degeneracy of a once noble iPeople, from that Barbarity it has for want of a Public Spirit contrafled 3 and revive that antient Virtue, which once made So confiderable a Fi-
gure
(302.)
gure in the World, nay, lift it up, in all Probability, not only abQvfe.thar, but. to a Worth above the noblest Nations of Antiquity : For the Glory of St PeppleTonststf not orsty in the Extent of their Dominions, but alfo in their Renown for Politer Studies, Bravery, Refolu-tion, Stability of Virtue, and by conSequence of their fixt; State of HappineSs.
This has made Efaminond.vsand Timofeon^ with Some other Greekj^ raiSe the Merit of their petty Battles, and narrow Acquifitiqns to a Balance, at least, with thoSe greater, and more extenfive of the most fuccelsful Roman Conquerors, and to weigh down all the Spreading DeSolations of the Huns^ Fandals^ or Goths^ whofe Arms Subdu’d	and Africa.
ThoSe therefore, my Lord, are the Advantages the Englfh ought most to covet, whom Nature Seems to have forbidden Foreign Clon-quests, at the Sime time that she perSuades Virtues Sufficient to establish and defend a HappineSs, that no Foreign Force can destroy, without our own Conlent; and which nothing has So often shaken, as thoSe Domestic Feuds and Parties, Set on foot, and fomented by Men of little Destgns, whofe narrow Souls led them to nothing but the Confideration of, and Zeal for their own particular and private Gain, never reflefling how unSafe and how precarious that must be while the Public is in danger; for he that Sacrifices the public Safety to private Advantage, takes away the Certainty of the Possession of that very Advantage^ by putting it in any one’s Power but the Public to be Master of it, (for the general Laws of a
Coun-
Country are a Surer Foundation and firmer Security , than any distant Hope or promis’d Favour of a Foreign Invader) or by provoking the Public to take that unlawful Gain from him, for which he quitted the Common Security of his Legal Pofleffions.
The Ground of this has been a Mechanic, a Trader’s, nay a USureFs Vice, that has invaded Men of Public Stations, whoSc Hands ought to have been pure of all thoSe Pollutions in Administration, which Spring from a Thirst of Money, without any regard to Justice. Saluji^ in his Advice to Cafar about the new Regulations of Rome^ has theSe Words.

“ The greatest Good you can dd Country, this City, your Self, your Posterity, and indeed all Mankind, is to take away, or at least to lessen, as far as humane Nature and the Necessities of Life will permit, that eager IntenSeneSs and Zeal for Money, which now prevails; -elSe there can be no just Administration of Affairs, Public or Private, War or Peace; For where-ever this Lust of Riches invades, neither

Discipline, wholSome Arts, nor any strength “ of Judgment, are able to be So much on the “ Guard, as entirely to prevent the Mind from falling Sooner or later under its Ty-

And as a ReaSon of this Advice, he urges in the Same DiScourSe, that Avarice
‘Bellua fera^ immanis^ intoleranda ejl^ am intendd. Ofpida^ Agros^ Fana^ atque Demos	; Di-

“ Avarice is a Beast, wild and full of insupportable Cruelty ; where-e’er it journeys, it Spreads a vast Destru6tion round about; it lays vi^ast HouSes, Temples, Towns, and Countries, impiousty and promiScuousty mingling Things divine and humane. No Walls nave strength enough, nor Army force enough to relist its ProgreSs, while it robs all Men of Fame, Modesty, Children, Parents, Country, ^c.
This is no enthufiastic Fancy of Speculation, no Poetic, or Hyperbolical Flight, but the Observation of a Man of BuIineSs, and the real and common Effeft of this Vice. We have daily Examples of the Truth, and Some too fresh in our Memory to mention without Pain. We daily See Armies, Towns and Countries betray’d for Money. This is too obvious
to
( 3°5 )
to dwell on to your Lordship: To remove it thereSore, as much as possible, and with it all its fatal Confequences ; to plant in its room the Love of PraiSe, (the Source of all the greatest and bravest Actions) the Love of our Country, and of one another, and So putting an End to our Divissons and Factions at Home, Secure a perpetual HappineSs to ourSelves, and unSpeakable Glory to the EngUJh Name, and in that to her Majesty, and to your Lordship, is the Dessgn of this PropbSal; more reaSon-able in its Means, more extenfive in its Aim, and more reputable by ConSequence in its Establishment, than that propos’d to Cardinal KtcheUeu: The Sum of, and the Motives to which, “ were only the Advantage it wou’d ‘ be to Eloquence, in perfecting their Lan-‘ guage, to render it capable of Succeeding the Latin and GreeJ^^ dead now to any national USe; to reScue their Tongue from the common Barbarity of the other Modern Speeches, of which they Suppos’d it the most capable of Perfection. That France had never wanted Brave Men, but only great Writers, to recommend their ACtions to Posterity, as the Greeks and Romans had done.
All which wou’d hold more true of the Englijh, whoSe Language is more Copious, more MaSculine, and more Harmonious than the French^ as is evident from the Numbers and Verssfication of the Poets of both Nations, as might be prov’d were it our preSent Sub-
jeCt; and as our Language is more worthy
cub
(joiS)
cultivating, So are our Heroes by no means inferior , tho’ they have indeed, generally Speaking, more wanted Writers to recommend them to Posterity.
’.Ds a glorious Task reServ’d for your Lord-ship to give us greater Heroes to celebrate, a more perfefi: Language, and more excellent Pens to celebrate them as we ought, and that by the Establishment of the Academy propos’d ; which is Secure from that after RemiSs-neSs and Neglefl:, which generally follow very laudable Deligns, after the first Heat of the Institution is over: As in the Royal-Society, much fallen from its primitive Vigour, which proceeds from the want of a Fund to Sup-ort Industry, and maintain Emulation. But lere, my Lord, where there are Beneficiary Fellowships, Prizes for thofe that excel, and a perpetual Succession of Tasks to employ them, there is no fear of its langui shing in a few Years. Bessdes, this deals in Things more obvious, as well as more ufefut to the Generality than the most part of our Physscal Enquiries, which tracing the Qaufe through the Effeffs, are too ohfcure to Be fatisfaflory, and too uncertain to be ufeful; and, indeed, amount to little more, than an ingenious and curious Amuferaent for fpeculative Men, perfeflly retir’d from Aition and the Bussnefs of Life: Whereas the greatest Parr, if not all of what I propoSe, is converSmt about our Aflions, prevalent in our Passions, and direflive of our Conduil in all the Stations of Life, and must make us ufeful as well as good.
From
( 3°7)
From hence, and from what 1 have and fhall offer, it will, my Lord, I hope appear, that what I propos’d to your Lordship, is demonstratively true, that is, an Academy of Sciences, first, more uSeful and extenstve than that of France; and next, that it shall be on a Fund of 8 or looooh per Annum, aristng neither from a Tax on the People, nor a Donation out of the (^een’s Pocket. Part of which I have already, the rest I now lay before your Lordship, without diSguiSe, not fearing the Projector’s Fate, when I confide it to your Lord-ship.
Tko' Pro'jeBsPeafe, ProjeBors are undone

doubt, but I alSo shall find my Account in its SucceSs; which I only wish, that I may be able to Serve ray Country, if possibly more, than in this; tho’ I doubt not, but your Lord-ship will think this no defpicable Service; when you have perus’d theSe Papers, which my past IllneSs has oblig’d me to*write, I con-feSs, in too great a Hurry for a Writing to be preSented to Such a Judge as your L.ordship; but 1 choSe rather to negledl that Accuracy of Stile and DiSpofition, the Subject I wrote on, and the Noble PerSoii I wrote to requir’d, than

TheSe are indeed Sentiments worthy a great Politician, and a Motive deServing a Patriot’s Zeal for the obtaining a Charter ; for ’tis the Interest of a just StateSeman to have the Public Virtue increas’d, as here luppos’d ; if their Delign anSwer’d the Expression. But their whole Aim, jndeed, is to polish the Language, improve Eloquence, and SuperviSe and adjust the Corre£lneSs of Stile, all which is but a distant Help to Virtue, and may be turn’d to the Service of Vice; nor is it one of the most immediate Steps to the promoting uSefuI Arts and Sciences, and is, in regard of the Public Service, the most inconssderable Part of my PropoSal.
There are but forty Members of the French Academy, and thoSe provided for only by Places in the Government, or precarious Pen-fions from the Crown, which indeed Richelieu dessgn’d to remedy by a perpetual Fund, when Death prevented him. Bessdes, the Number is too Small to have the decifive Pow’r of a Language over fo large a Body of Learned Men, as Such a Nation contains; which Objection is remov’d in this, by more than doubling the Number, and in that par-
4-	ticular
(31°)
ticular leaving room for all other Men of Learning to come in, as will be Seen by pe-rufing my PropoSal, which is,
To establish an Academy of stxty Honorary Fellowships, conststing of ( a ) Nobility , (I’) Commons, and Universtty-Men of the most Interest, Judgment and Learning. And forty Beneficiary, (o') ten of which to be Dramatic Poets, and ten Historians; the rest Mathematicians, Lyric, Heroic and Satyric Poets, PhiloSoph ers, Phyficians, Lawyers^ Muficians, &c. and that thefe Members be all Natives of England^ for it wou’d be an Infamy too fhame-
ful,
(^) I mean hy this, thofe JSfoblemeny ^that have the nioji Interefl in the Voufe of Lovds^ as well as thofe of the moji polite and /olid Parts.

{d) Vhe Reafon of this Number of Dramatic Po--etSy is plain from my lafl Paper to your Lordjhipy from them proceeding fo large a Share of the Fund ; and as for the Llifmiansy your Lordfdp will foon fee a a>n^ wincing Reafon for it„

ful, to have En^lijh Language dir eft ed by any Foreigners, who, if they once get in, will leave no room for any one but their own Countrymen in a little Time. Against which Scandal the only Defence is the making it a fundamental Law, that none whatever on any Account or Conlideration whatever be admitted a Fellow, without a Substantial Proof of their being born in England, or of	Parents.
That under their Royal Pro teller there be a Chancellor of the first and most worthy of the Nobility,, their first, your Lordship, and who hereafter, is to be choSe by the Academy. A Vice-Chancellor, Secretary, Register, and Library-keeper, choSe out of the Beneficiary Fellows, as being oblig’d to Duties, in which the Honorary are free.
• The ( «) Vice-Chancelshr prefides in the Ast
Semblies (iJnleSs when'We Chancellor thinks fit to be there) gathers the Opinions of the Fellows, giving his own last, keeps the Seals, and Seals all the Orders and A<sts of the Academy.
The Secretary is to write all Letters Domef-fic and Foreign by the Academy’s Order, all Dispatches, Orders, Certificates, to read the Statutes to the Member that is admitted, before the Vice-Chancellor exhorts him to the Observation of them. (^)	The
(^) He is alfb fee that the Laws a??d Statutes of the Academy be put in Execution^ and to have a cajl-^ ing V(i e on a?i Equality.
(fc) LIhe Secretary alfo ought to draw from the Re->

The Register writes down the ReSolutions and Debates of the Day, keeps the Papers, or at least the Register of the Papers, &‘c. of the Academy, (e)
ThoSe three Officers choSe by Plurality of Voices, or by balloting, out of the Beneficiary Fellows; and that on their Eledlion, Addition be made to their Salaries, Too/, ^er Annum to the Vice-Chancellor, who is to be choSe once a Year, and 50 l.fer Annum apiece to the other two.
That the Methods of Debate, Decifion, ^c, be establish’d by the Academy.
That the Academy have a public Seal, with Device and Motto, the Queen’s Piflure in a Minervds Habit, with thefe Words, Armis tu~ tetur^ morihus ornat^ or what elSe may be agreed on by the Academy.^,
The most imparti^Way that I can think of doing Justice to Merit, and to keep out worth-leSs Intruders, is, either for your Lordship to chooSe all the Beneficiary Fellows, or elSe that the Honorary being nam’d and compos’d of Such, as I have mention’d, get the Charter paSs’d by Afl of Parliament; and then chooSe the Beneficiary Fellows from Such Candidates
as

MembervS.
That there be five Clergymen Beneficiary Fellows, that they be eminent for Mathematics or Some of the politer Literature.

But to make this Dictionary the more complete, all the other learned Men of the Nation to be invited to contribute their Pains to the compiling it, with this AfiSurance, that what they contribute shall be publickly acknowledg’d. And the better to obtain this, there shall be from time to time .printed Notice given of what the Academy go upon; among which, if any difficult Cafe ariSe, that in particular to be recommended to the Learned, wffioSe Papers are to be tranSmitted to the Secretary or Register of the Academy, who is to register them and their Author, to take a Receipt of each Member to whom he, according to the Academy’s Order, delivers them outj for if out of Delign he Smother any of them, he must loSe his Place. That every Gentleman, that Sends any Paper, Set down his Rea-Sons for his Opinion in Etymology, Orthography, Syntax, &c.

That the PropoSals, and Method of the French Academy, in compofing their Diistio-nary be conIi<fer’d, follow’d, or rejeisted, according to the Judgment of the Fellows.
That the Grammar, and Dictionary being done, they proceed to a ProSodia and Rhe-torick. In the Rhetorick, befides the Tropes and Figures, the Propriety of Stile, and the true Beauties of Eloquence in the Englijh Tongue, with an Enquiry which is most just and natural, Ours or the Ancients, That here the Charaisteristick of the Sublime, the mean and the low Stiles be fix’d; and in this they must divide the Language into sts proper Di-stindlions, anSwering in Propriety to thoSe three Stiles ; they having by lohie Authors of Note been all promiScuoussy confounded together.

Words, and their TranSposstions, according to the USe of the best of our Authors, and to coniider how far they are Beautiful, that is, how far they contribute to Variety and Harmony. That here the whole Art of Poetry , be diScuSs’d, and a true Standard of CriticiSm in the Several kinds of Poetry fixt, which must be drawn from the Defign of the Art, , the Nature and ReaSon of the Thing,., the Genius of the People, that is, from Ariftotle^ „ Horace^ and theEjfay on Poetry ; in which. Some are Such Libertines, that they think all regu-. lar Principles of Art an Impofition not to be born; yet, while they refuSe in'Poetry the.' Rules of that j\rt as the 'I'est of their Performance, they will allow no Man a Master .' in any other, that follows not the Rules of his Art, though thoSe of Poetry are not leSs -founded in Nature and ReaSon, and indeed are^ the only Distinction betwixt, an Artist and a r Pretender. This has open’d the Door to all •; the abominable Scribblers that stave So often • won a Reputation from the Ignorance of the Town; nay, who have .past for Authors of the first Rank, though their Writings, as Ben. : Sohnfon in his DiScoveries has it, “ a Man. “ wou’d not wrap up any wholeSome Drug ‘‘ in, ” For if Poetry have no certain.; Standard qf Excellence, no fxt Rules to go . by, then it must be an arbitrary Licence, off Saying and writing what extravagant.

Poetry; a Notion So very whimfical, that it was never entertain’d in any City in the Uni-verSe but this, which levels all Men, makes R— and Durfey as good Dramatick Poets as Otway and Wycherley. Nor was there ever a plainer Evidence of this than in T-—-—— which having not one iingle (^alification of a just Play, run away with the Opinions, not only of the common Sort, but ev’n with Some Men of Senfe, either through Inadvertence, or Ignorance of the Art: For if they had ever read and understood any thing of the Matter, they wou’d never have borne an Ait of ir.
To take away this falSe and uncertain Ap-plauSe, that has diScourag’d, and always must deter Men of Senfe and Judgment from meddling with the Stage, is one of the Aims of this Academy, and particularly of this Pro-Sodia, and Art of Poetry. For lince there can be no doubt but that the Drama is absolutely the most uleful, and, I think, the most noble Province of Poetry, it will, by this means appearing in its true Grandeur, be judg’d So by all Men. For this ReaSon it will be necessary, before the Choice of the Dramatick Members, that there be a Standard fix’d, as a Test of their Performances, and that drawn from Arijlotle^s Rhetorick, Poeticfcs, &c. in which I’m Sure Daciefs Notes ought to be conSulted', as being the most Gentlemanlike CriticiSm of that Nation, and really deduc’d from Nature, and the Author he explains.

an<l' Reputation that is due to them, and the Infamy of a stothful, una6Iive Life ; and that to give Nobility its Ancient Lustre, he must Show thoSe public Virtues in the Service of his Country, which first distinguish’d Man from Man in the Esteem of ev’n the Wife them Selves.
That there be Degrees taken in History, and public Examshations; and Rewards for the greatest Proficients in it.
That the Mathematical Fellowsdiave publick Leflures of all ustful Parts of the Mathema-ticks in the EnyIifo Language, as Arithmetick, Algebra, Geometry, and the new Improv ments of it, Astronomy, Mechanicks, Fortification, Navigation, ^c. and free DifSerta-tions and Experiments, that may tend to promote the Knowledge of Nature, arid be Serviceable to Mankind.
That the Phyficians be oblig’d to bave -a ic Leflure of Anatomy, Plants,/ Herbs, esr-c.. and communicate the History of their Practice. See BacHviti^y &c.

My Lord.
T must be confeSs’d that Religion is not only an admirable, but the best Rule and Motive of our Actions; yet through the Frailty of our Nature, the Rewards and Punishments .Religion promiles, and threatens, being not preSent, but at Some Distance, the Number that is influenc’d by them to Action is ex-treamly Small; for what by ForgetfulneSs what we do not fee; the WeakneSs of humane Nature, too much immers’d in immediate Affairs, and the falSe Hopes of a fatisfafto-ry Repentance at last, Men find not So strong a Band and Tic to Virtue and Aflions beneficial to the Publick, as they wou’d if there were Some preSent Rewards and Punishments to excite them, either by menacing Some immediate Detriment, or promifing as Sudden an Advantage to our Reputation, or predominant Passions.
But Punishment, tho’ preSent, has not sh lively and forcible an Effe^l on Mankind, as Reward. For first, the meanest and most inferior Sort of People are only affefled by them, as the Execution of all Penal Laws Sufficiently demonstrates, proving ev’n there almost wholly inefficacious. Next, Penal Laws can never be equally and impartially administer’d ; for the Executors of them are Men
of
(' 3^8 )
of little iSenSt
great Honesty, tune, without Knowledge to
and by ConSequence of and of a low precarious For'" the Benefit of Education or ^	SeaSon them from Knaves ;
Such as Beadles, Inforrriers, Hackney Constables, or at most Justices of the Peace, who too often are Men that thrust themstlves into the Commistion for a Livelihood, or Such, as are put in, without regard to their Abilities, or Honesty, meerly to lerve a Turn. But if by chance a Justice of Peace be a Man truly qualified for, and exa6l in the Execution of his Office, he will have nothing to do; for the Constables and Beadles will only go to thoSe Justices, who will connive at their Rogueries, and let them come in for a Share of the Profit. Farther, Penal Laws are the Market of Informers only. Fellows of the most profligate Principles, Set to work purely by the Extremity of a necessitous Fortune , and (their Oaths being their< Livelihood) who Swear, for,,or against, as the Criminal has, or has not Money to bribe them, without regard to Right or Wrong, or the Diffates of Law or ConSci-ence.
But, my Lord, to enter into the Detail of this Matter, wou’d be to entertain your Lord-ship with what is not So agreeable as true. I will therefore turn l^o Rewards, which Set the brisker Spirits to work, that are not touch’d, with Punishments (which at most only deter from Vice, bat promote no Virtue) and Such Rewards, as affecl' our Passions ; that gratify our Pride, have an uncommon Force in the
purSuit of A<stions beneficial to the. Pablick
for
( 329 )
for Men love to strive for thoSe Rewards that make them immediately conSpicuous among their Friends and Acquaintance, and give them a Place and Regard abhve thole, whom either Birth or Fortune may have made their Superiors.
For this ReaSon, (to Say nothing of the Rewards and Triumphs of the (<*) Romans') on extraordinary Emergencies, Several Princes, to promote the publick Bravery, have (in Imitation of William Duke of Gmenne.^ and Count of Auvery^ne, who in 898 instituted the first against the Normans') establish’d Orders of Knighthood, by preSent Honours to excite their Subjefls to extraordinary Affcions : Thus this Defign Sets up publick Rewards, and pub-lick Orations to rouSe us up to a vigorous Defence of ourSelves, against the common Enemy ; and to nobler A£l:s and Ambition, than uSually we have known of late.
That Reformation of our M\nners which the falSe Zealots have for Some Years made Such a preposterous Pother about in the Streets and Brothels, when they negledled Morality in their Pulpits, is not to be obtain’d but by Spreading the Excellence of the Moral Virtues, and raistng the Esteem of them in the Minds of Men, buSy’d now about Things of a more groveling and Servile Nature 5 as how to in-creaSe their own Wealth, not the publick Glo'

ry and Security, for they perceive that the first must fall to the Ground, if she latter be not Supported. For the effe£listg which I preSume the following Rules will'be of Sufficient Force.
That there be at least one Moral Lecture or Oration every Week, made by the Benefic’d Fellows, each in his Turn ; and one once a Month by Such Honorary Fellow as shall think fit to make it. That the Aim of theSe
Moral Lectures, and their chief Topicks, shall be to recommend the Moral and Politi-
cal Virtues ; to show their Excellence and Necessity to the Sublistence, Well-being and Happinefs of Humane Society. To recommend the Ties of Nature in the Alliances of Blood, expofing the Folly of the Vices destructive of Morality, and to show them punish’d in Examples drawn from History facred and prophane. Thefe, and all other Arguments, direisted to instill a Love of Glory from the Service of our Country, a Thirst of Fame by doing A6lions ferviceable to our Prince.
The better to promote this, great part of ev’ry other Oration shall be Spent in the Praife of Some particular EngUJhmayiy that has formerly, or shall do now any puhiick brave A5l:ion,or any general Good, either by the Sword (and that chiefly at Sea) or by his Wit, Ingenuity, Liberality, &‘c. as the finding out, promoting, or improving any profitable Trade to the Nation ; publick Donations to Arts; publick Buildings, as Ships, &^c. or to the Academy in particular. That befides this publick PraiSe,
their
( 331 )
their Names to be enroll’d among the Heroes* and Patriots of their Country, and that every one, or most of the Poets be oblig’d to write on him, and a Prize given to the best Performer, which being read after the Oration, his Name shall be enroll’d in the midst of Triumphal Songs and Mustek.
If any private Seaman does any extraordinary Afstion, (bestdes the Queen’s Reward, which is uSual) he shall stt in an eminent Place in the Oratory, and hear his A6l prais’d, and receive Some Badge of Favour of the Academy to wear, by which others wou’d be encourag’d to do the like, and he to attempt more. If more than one be concern’d in the Aflion, that they stt all together in the fame Manner. But if done by an Officer or Man of higher Post, then to stt in a more eminent Place, with the Members of the Academy on each Side of him or them, preSenting each with a Laurel of Silver or Gold; with various other Ceremonies too long here to particularize. Sir Walter Raleigh y no Speculative Politician, viSes theSe publick Rewards, Triumphs, as prevailing Motives to publick AfHons; the Romans praflically experienc’d the good EfTefl of them. For tho’ Pride and Vanity be the CauSe here, yet the Publick wou’d receive the fame Advantage from them, as if they fprung from a Modern, more refin’d Notion. For as Salujl obServes in his DiScourSe to Cafar^ of modelling the Common-wealth, Gloria Indujlria alitar; ubi earn dembferu^ ipfa per fe

** nourish’d by Glory, which if you take away. Virtue remains too forbidding, and uncouth.” For indeed, however gay and agreeable Virtue may Seem to the Sublimer Part of Men, her Trappings and Appearance only touch the many.
At the end of ev’ry Oration, the Moral of the Plays* to be afled the following Week, or of thoSe afled the Week before, shall be explain’d and enforc’d, that is, the USe that may justly be made of the Chara£lers and Incidents, &c, of both the Tragedies and the Comedies ; the Docirines that may be drawn from them to the End propos’d, by Seeing the Inconveniencies of Vice, the RidiculouSneSs of Folly, as there drawn from the Practice of the World; and repreSented truly, that true Gonclufions might be deduc’d from it. And on the other Side must be urg’d the Glory and Advantages of Virtue,
That if any Man of Parts, tho’ not of the Academy, deiire to fpeak or have Spoke, any Moral (Oration, the Academy must first LicenSe it: In which regard must be had to theSe Particulars, that it contain nothing offenfive to Religion and good Manners^:	Nothin^
derogatory to the Academy,, or the Caufe they promote by theSe Orations ;	That it b
not tedious nor dull: And lastly. That it be, rather Spoke by one of the Aftors, than the Author ; that So first they may be Sure to have what they licens’d Spoke; and next, that no damage be done to the DiScourSe, by an ill and . ungrateful Delivery,; that the Player "that
Speaks

Nor are any of the Members to Speak their own Orations, if they are not Sure of a graceful Afbon and Utterance, for the Honour of the Society, for that wou’d make them ridiculous, and what is thought ridiculous, Can ne’er have Authority.
That the Moral and Encomiastick Orations be printed by the Academy, and that the greatest part of the Profit arifing from thence, be put into the Bank for Prizes; and the Impression to be Monthly, in a Small, but fair Charafler, that they may make a cheap Pocket Book,
That they be dedicated to Some Man of Merit among the Nobility, dignify’d Clergy, &c.

Nay, I am very well assur’d, that if a Play be wrote according to the Rules, perfefHy understood , and with a (jenius, it cannot fail of pleafing both the good and bad Judges. --—But to proceed : —No Tragic, nor Comic Poet, to have a Play afled , nor to be admitted, till past 28 Years old at least, (none in Athens being admitted till past thirty) for the Performances of the Drama rec^uire a fixt and Settled Judgment, or a Knowledge of Mankind, which few have before that time, or are capable of producing any thing worthy the Dignity of the Stage, or of lasting Merit.
That after Admission ev’ry Dramatic Poet be oblig’d to write a Play, at least, once in two Years, till Superannuated ; for this is not de-lign’d to be a Hive of Drones.
That the Dramatic Poets, both before and after Admission, have the 3d and the 6th Day free, without any Charges, half the Profits of the 9th, and the 8th Part of the Profits above the Charges every time ’tis ailed for ever, or rather during their Lives, after which the Academy to have the whole.
That
( )
That if, after the Beneficiary Fellowships are full, any young Man appear above z8, worthy Encouragement, and bring a Play which the Academy approves, and promifes a Great Man hereafter, that on his Second he be admitted as a Fellow extraordinary ; and befides his 3d and (Jth Days, &c. if necefSary, that he be allow’d 20 s. per^eekj till there be a Vacancy to receive him-
That the Burden of the Poetic Part of the Dictionary lie not So much on the Dramatic, as the other Poets, who must be Scholars, and draw their Opinions from the PraCtice of our best Poets, ReaSon, and the Imitation of the Antients.
As for the MateridDramatica^ I dare not treS-paSs on your Lordship’s Patience to tranScribe it, having So many things to mention which cannot be omitted.
That the Dramatic Poets shall not take any Foreign Story to write on, that the Virtue of the Englifh Nation loSe not the Glory of the Englifi Wit, and Poetry to celebrate it. The Saxon Story being obScure enough to give the Poet as much room for Invention, as the fabulous Part of the Gretf History did thofe Poets, (and that with a greater Probability) to whoSe Invention we owe the receiv’d Examples of all Heroic Fortitude and WiSdom ; as Hercules^ A-chilles^ Ulyjjes.^ Thefem., Pirhhottr^ yafon^ Atcejfay
Ifhly^ema^ &c. By this means the Greef Poets made their own Country the Spring and Source of Virtue and WiSdom, never vouchsafing a Foreign Hero in their Plays ; whereas we find Heroes for ours in ev’ry Country but our own-.
(337)
To improve this, Encouragement must be given to Such as shall improve the Saxoa Story in little Histories, or Novels, building fine, tho’ fistitious Incidents on certain Grounds, which wou’d be a Store-houSe of Plots, and a great Help to the Poet’s Invention. The Gred.s justly believ’d that Domestick Examples were more likely to afifedl than Foreign, where Clime,. Customs,Manners,Religion,^r. might alter and confound the LeCSon it shou’d teach. Tho’ now and then a shining Charafter of Greek, or Roman Virtue may be wrote on; and Otivay^s 0rphct>7,and Venice Preferd.d. be play’d with Some Alterations. The most regular of Shakeffeads are excepted out of this Rule. CD But the Comic Poet must never, on any Pretence whatever, lay his Scene out of England, lest the Follies ind Vices represented may not Seem to relate to us. Belldes, most, if not all our Dramatic Pbets, that have laid their Scenes in Foreign Countries, have been guilty of monstrous AhSurdities, and fin’d against the Manners to a great degree ; to avoid which , none on a Foreign Story shall be admitted in Comedy, and, as I have Said, extremely few in Tragedy. Befides , by this Means the Dramatic Poet may have an Opportunity of Complementing fbme preSent Families, either as his private Obligations, or their publick Merits demand.
As to what Charafiers shall be allow’d,, the . Academy on their Meeting be the Judge;
