PREFACE;
W'ritten by a Friend of the Author.
TH E Taste oS the Public, with regard to Epistolary Writing, having been much vitiated by Some modern Authors, it may not be amiSs to premiSe Some Short matter concerning it in this Place, that the Reader may not expect another Kind oS Entertainment than he will meet with in the following Papers, nor impute the Author’s destgned Deviation from the A 2 common
iv The P R E F A C E. common Road, to any Mistake or Error. .
Those Writings which are called Letters, may be divided into Sour ClaSTes. Under the first ClaSs may be ranged thoSe Letters, as well antientas modern, which have been written by Men, who have filled up the principal Characters on the Stage of LiSe, upon great and memorable Occafions. TheSe have been always esteemed as the most valuable Parts oS HiPtory, as they are not only the most authentic Memorials oS Facts, but as they Serve greatly to illustrate the true Character oS the ¥/riter, and do in a manner introduce the Perfon him-felf to our Acquaintance.
The P R E F A C E. v
A Second Kind owe their Merit not to Truth, but to Invention ; Such are the Letters which contain ingenious Novels, or Shorter Tales, either pathetic or humorous; theSe bear the Same Relation to the Sor-mer, as Romance doth to true History; and, as the Sormer may be called Short Histories, So may theSe be styled Short Romances.
I N the next Branch may be ranked thoSe Letters, which have past between Men oS Eminence in the Republic oS Literature. Many of thefe are in high Estimation in the learned World, in which they are constdered as having equal Authority to that, which the political World allows to thofe of the first Clafs.
Besides
Vl
The F R E F A C E.
Besides theSe three Kinds of Letters, which have all their feveral Merits, there are two more, with which the Moderns have very plentifully fupplied the World, tho’ I Shall not be very profufe in my Encomiums on either: Thefe are Love-Letters, and Letters of Converfa-tion, in which last are contained the private Affairs of Perfons of no Con-fequence to the Public, either in a political or learned Constderation, or indeed in any Constderation whatever.
With thefe two Kinds of Letters the French Language in particular fo vastly abounds, that it would employ most of the leifure Hours of Life to read them all; nay, I believe indeed, they are the principal Study
The P RE F A C E. vii Study oS many oS our fine Gentlemen and Ladies, who learn that Language.
And hence fuch Readers have learnt the critical PhraSes oS a familiar eafy Style^ a concife epiflolary Style^ &"c. and theSe they apply to all Letters whatever.
Now, Srom Some polite modern PerSormances, written I fuppofe by this Rule, I much doubt, whether theSe French Readers have any just and adequate Notion of this epiflolary Stykj with which they are So enamoured. To fay the truth, I question whether they do not place it entirely in Short, abrupt, unconnected Periods; a Style fo eaSy, that any Man may write it, and which, one would imagine, it must be very A 4	difficult,
viii The P R E F A C E. difficult to procure any PerSon to read.
T o Such Critics thereSore I would recommend Ovid,^ who was perhaps the ablest Writer oS les Let-tres Galantes^ that ever lived. In his Arte amandi they will find the Sallowing Rule,
—-prcefens ut videare loqui. viz. that thefe Letters Should preserve the Style oS Conversation; and in his Epistles they yviW See this excellently illustrated by Example. But iS we are to Sorm our Idea oS the Conversation oS Some modern Writers from their Letters, we Shall have, I am aSraid, a very indifferent Opinion oS both.
But in reality, this Style oS Conversation is only proper^ at least only neceffary
The P R E F A C E. ix necestkry to theSe, which I have called Letters oS Converfation ; and is not at all requistte, either to Letters oS Bustnefs, which in ASter-ages make a Part oS History, or to thoSe on the Subject oS Literature and Criticifm.
Much lefs is it adapted to the Novel or Story-Writer; Sor what difference is there, whether a Tale is related this or any other way ? And Sure no one will contend, that the epistolary Style is in general the most proper to a Novelist, or that it hath been uSed by the best Writers oS this Kind.
IT is not my PurpoSe here to write a large Differtation on Style in general, nor to affign what is proper to the Historian, what to the Rp-
X The P R E F A C E. mance, and what to the NoveF Writer, nor to obServe in what manner all theSe differ Srom each other; it is fufhcient to have obviated an Objection, which, I SoreSaw, might be made to thefe little Volumes by Some, who are in truth as incapable oS knowing any oS the Faults, as oS reaping any oS the Beauties oS an Author ; and I astiire them, there is no Branch oS Criticifm, in which Learning, as well as Good-fenSe is more required, than to the Sorming an accurate Judgment oS Style, tho’ there is none, I believe, in which every trifling Reader is more ready to give his DeciSion.	|
Instead oS laying down any Rules Sor the uSe oS Such Tyros in the critical Art, I Shall recommend them to one, who is a Master oS Style,
The P R E F A C E. xi Style, as oS every other Excellence. This Gentleman in his Perjian Letters, many oS which are written on the most important Subjects in E-thics. Politics, and PhiloSophy, hath condescended to introduce two or three Novels: in theSe they will find that inimitable Writer very ju-diciousty changing the Style which he uSes on other Occafions, where the Subjects oS his Letters require the Air and Style oS ConverSation ; to preServe which, in relating Stories that run to any length, would be faulty in the Writer, and tirefome to the Reader.
T o conclude this Point, I know not of any eSTential Difference between this, and any other way of writing Novels, fave only, that by making ufe of Letters, the Writer
xii The P R E F A C E. is Sreed Srom the regular Beginnings and Conclustons oS Stories, with Some other Formalities, in which the Reader oS Taste finds no leSs EaSe and Advantage, than the Author himSelS.
As to the Matter contained in the Sollowing Volumes, I am not perhaps at liberty to declare my Opinion : Relation and Friendship to the Writer may draw upon me the CenSure oS Partiality, iS I Should be as warm, as I am inclined to be in their Commendation.
The Reader will however excuSe me, iS I adviSe him not to run them over with too much Haste and Indifference ; Such Readers will, I promiSe them, find little to admire in this Book, whoSe Beauties (iS it
have
ThePREF A.CE. xiii have any) require the fame Attention to difcover them, with which the Author herfelf hath constdcred that Book of Nature, whence they are taken. In Books, as well as Pictures, where the Excellence lies in the Expreffion or Colouring only, the first Glance of the Eyes acquaints us with all the Perfection of the Piece ; but the nicest and most delicate Touches of Nature are not fo foon perceived. In the Wcirks of Cervantes or Hogarth.^ he is, I believe, a wretched Judge, who dif-covers no new Beauties on a fecond, or even a third Perufal.
And here I cannot controll myfelf from averring, that many Touches of this kind appear to me in thefe Letters; Some of which I cannot help thinking as fine, as I
have
xiv The P R E F A C E. have ever met with in any of the Authors, who have made Human Nature their Subject.
A s Such Obfervations are generally fuppofed to be the Effects of long Experience in, and much Acquaintance with Mankind, it may perhaps furprize many, to find them in the Works of a Woman ; efpeci-ally of one, who, to ufe the common Phrafe, hath feen fo little of tie World: and I Should not wonder on this account, that thefe Letters were afcribed to another Author, if I knew any one capable of writing them.
But in reality the Knowledge of Human Nature is not learnt by living in the Hurry of the World.
True
The P R E F A C E. xv True Genius, with the help oS a little Converfatioix, will be capable oS making a vast Progrefs in this Learning ; and indeed I have obferved, there are none who know So little oS Men, as thoSe who are placed in the Crouds, either oS BustneSs or Plea-fure. The Truth oS the Astertion, that Pedants in Colleges have Seldom any Share oS this Knowledge, doth not ariSe Srom any DeSect in the College, but Srom a DeSect in the Pedant, who would have Spent many Years at St, "James s to as little Purpofe : for daily Experience may convince us, that it is poSTible for a Blockhead to fee much of the World, and know little of it.
The Objection to the Sex of the Author hardly requires anAnfwer:
It
xvi The P R E F A C E.
It will be chiefly advanced by thofe, who derive their Opinion oS Women very unSairly Srom the fine Ladies of ♦the Age ; whereas, if the Behaviour of their Counterparts the Beaus, was to denote the Understanding of Men, I apprehend the Conclusion would be in favour of the Women, without making a Compliment to that Sex. I can of my own Knowledge, and from my own Acquaintance bear Testimony to the PoSTibility of thofe Examples, which History gives of Women eminent for the highest Endowments and Faculties of the Mind. I Shall only add an Anfwer to the fame Objection, relating to David Simple^ given by a Lady of very high Rank, whole Quality is however lefs an Honour to her than her Understanding. So far.
The PREFACE. xvii far^ faid She, from doubting David Simple to be the Performance of a Woman^ I am well convinced.^ it could not have been written by a Man.
In the Conduct oS Women, in that great and important BustneSs of their Lives, the Affair oS Love, there are Mysteries, with which Men are perfectly unacquainted: their Education being on this head in Constraint of, nay, in direct Opposttion to, Truth and Nature, creates fuch a constant Struggle between Nature and Habit, Truth and Hypocrify, as introduce often much Humour into their Characters; efpecially when drawn by fenstble Writers of their own Sex, who are on this Subject much more capable^ than the ablest of ours.
VoL. I.
I
xviii The P R E F A C E.
I Remember it was the Ob-, fervation oS a Lady, Sor whoSe Opinion I have a great Veneration, that there is nothing more generally unnatural, than the Characters oS Women on the Stage, and that even in our best Plays : IS this be Sact, as I stncerely believe it is, whence can it proceed, but Srom the Ignorance in which the artificial Behaviour oS Women leaves, us, oS what really pastes in their Minds, and which, like all other Mysteries, is known only to the Initiated ?
Many oS the Soregoing Aster-tions will, I question not, meet v/ith very little Astent Srom thoSe great and wiSe Men, who are not:
only
The PREFACE. xix only absolute Masters oS Some poor Woman’s PerSon, but likewiSe oS her Thoughts. With Such Opposttion I must rest contented; but what I more dread, is, that I may have unadvisedly drawn the ReSentment oS her own lovely Sex against the Author oS thefe Volumes, Sor having betrayed the Secrets oS the Society.
T o this I Shall attempt giving two AnSwers: First, that theSe nice Touches will, like the Signs oS MaSonry, eScape the Observation and Detection oS all thoSe, who are' not already in the Secret;
Secondly, iS She Should have expoSed Some oS thoSe nicer Female Foibles, which have cScaped a 2	most
vx The F R E F A C F. most other Writers, She hath at the fame time , nobly difplayed the Beauties and Virtues of the more amiable Part, which abundantly over^ balances in the account. By comparing thefe together, young Ladies may, if they pleafe, receive great Advantages: I will venture to fay, no Book extant is fo well calculated for their Instruction and Improvement. It is indeed a Glafs, by which they may drefs out their Minds, and adorn themfelves with more becoming, as well sts more lasting Graces, than the Dancing-Master, the Manteau-Maker, or the Millener can give them. Here even their Vanity may be rendered ufe-fiil, as it may make them detest and fcorn all bafe, mean. Shuffling Tricks, and admire and cultivate whatever
The P R E F A C E. xxi whatever is truly amiable, generous and good: Here they must: learn, if they will pleafe to attend, that the Confummation of a Woman’s Character, is to maintain the Qualities of Goodnefs, Tendernefs, Affection and Sincerity, in the Several focial Offices and Duties pf Life ; and not to unite Ambition, Avarice, Luxury, and Wantonnefs in the Perfon of a Woman of the World, or to affect Folly, Childifli-nefs and Levity, under the Appel* lation of a fine Lady.
To conclude, I hope, for the Sake of my fair Country-Women, that thefe excellent Pictures of Vir-r tue and Vice, which, to my Knowledge, the Author hath bestowed fuch Pains in drawing, will not be thrown
, ThePREF AGE* thrown away on the World, but that much more Advantage may accrue to the Reader, than the Good-nature and Senstbility of the Age have, to their immortal Ho^ nour, bestowed on the Author*

Camilla, [From the
My Journey hither, was as agreeable as it was poffible, confidering the weak State of Health, in which I parted from you; and fince my Arrival here, I am Surprifingly recovered. How happy are we when, in giving another PleaSure, even Health itSelf becomes a double Bleffing!

Defire to indulge myfelf in st Morning^s Walk. Valentinewho is at once my Lover and my Hushand, by his immediate offering to be my Guide and Companion, en-creafed my inward Tranquillity, and render'd every outward Object yet more plea-fing. The Weather was fair, and the Pro-fpect of every thing around me heighten’d and pleaSed my Imagination, with the Object of both my Esteem and Affection, who fondly Smiled an Approbation on all my Remarks. Whilst I was overjoy’d to find my utmost Wisti gratified, in feeing it in my power to give him plcaSure, I need hot tell you how happily I pasted theMorn-ing. I could not thjnk Adam and in ParadiSe could exceed us in BliSs. From this real, this Substantial HappineSs, a HappineSs, to the attaining which. So very little Expence is necessary, my Thoughts involuntarily wander’d through the various PurSuits and the numberleSs Anxieties of Mankind, about thoSe things, which when attain’d, only load their Minds with still more Cares, and involve and perplex their Brains with ten thouSand distractingdiitri-cate Labyrinths.
Lin DAM IRA
L E T T E R I. 51
Lindamira has Sacrificed all her Peace (and wifely abandon’d ia a dishonourable manner a Man of SenSe whom she liked, with a moderate Fortune) to the Ambition of a great Equipage, and a Coach and Six (burden’d with a Fool she hates) in which she now continually fighs and laments her own Folly j and thoSe Jewels, which once by their glaring Lustre So* dazzled her Eyes, as to blind her to her real Interest, now Seem like Burthens she is obliged to carry, rather than like Ornaments she delights to wear.
The gay, the blooming Strepbon for-Sook, and broke the Heart of an amiable young Woman v/ho loved him, allied him-Self to Age and UglineSs, for the Sake of Grandeur and Wealth: And now eternal NoiSe interrupts his Meals, and Such continual Jealoufies break out in loud Complaints from his Wife’s Tongue, that he would gladly retire to Peace and Calmnefs; and could he but be rid of his Torment, the Wealth that attends it he would chearfully refign.

TH AT ctlMen defire to behappy is cer» tain, and yet to judge by tfieir PurSuits, one could almost imagine they Seek MiSery with the gr^test Alfiduity; for they bustle and labour and strive for’ things often improbable, fometimes impoflible to attain 5 and if attainable, most times unprofitable and infi-pid; whilst they negledl the very things that would render them happy, which perhaps are within their reach, and would cost them very little to come at.
X I Remember my Father once,carry’d a Country Fellow to London with him; he confider’d the poor Man’s Ignorance of the Ways of the Town, and Seldom Sent him far on Errands. He one day order’d him to go to a Shop in the next Street to fetch fome Trifle. The poor Creature was not to be heard of any more ’till ten o’clock at Night, when he came home puffing and blowing for Breath, and in fuch a Heat, that it threw him into a violent Fever, of which he with difficulty recover’d. On Examination we found, that when he first enquired for the Shop to which he was Sent,
he
let T E R ^ I. S3
he was So unfortunate, as to meet with Some very ingenious JVitSy who on Seeing a poor aukward Country Fellow, thought it would be charming Sport to Send him out of his way; and thus from one to another was he fent up and down that great Metropolis, ’till wearied with the fruitleSs Search of what he might have had within ten Yards of his own Home, he gain’d nothing but Difeafe and Pain for his tireSome fatiguing Labour.
How many wife Men, whpSe immenSe Knowledge extends So far as to know every Street and Corner of London, would laugh at this poor Fellow’s Ignorance, by them called Folly; and yet in the Purfuit of the only Thing of ConSequence to them in this World, namely their own HappineSs, would be Sent out of the Road by every Fool who pretends to judge of another’s SenSations, and to lay -down Rules for the attaining that, of which every Individual mush judge for themSelves. But you, Camilla,, who So strongly prove your own Capacity of enjoying HappineSs^ by the great Art you have of diffufing it to all around you# B 3	will
54 L E T T E R I.
will cafily, without any Aflistance, make the Application of my Story.
Your Brother and his happy Wife and I Spent three Hours in great pleaSure, reciprocally conveying our Ideas to each other, without any DiSguife or artful Concealment of our Thoughts. But as I promiSed to give you an Account of every thing I met with,the Scene must now be changed,and I will inform you what pasted where I Spent the Afternoon. Indeed it would be im-postible for any two Scenes to be more different than that already deferibed, and what I am now going to relate. From Solid Pleasure and real Happinefs, how great was the Change to their lifelefs Shadow, Foppery and Drefs, Impertinence and Folly! I was Surrounded with a Set of Company who talked So fast, that their Breath, like that of dying Men, Seem’d exhausted whilst yet they fancy’d they had much to utter. No Stranger that has appear’d here for this Fortnight, eScaped the Cenfure of thefe Critics on Life, But the Reputations of Foes and Friends, guilty or innocent, fell alike the commoa Prey to their mercileSs Rage.

The least hurtful Part of their DiS-courSe, was the falling on the outward Behaviour of their Acquaintance. OneLady was fo forward. She was almost impudent 5 another So bashful, that she must be quite a Fool; a third To infipid, she had nothing ta SayforherSelf; andafourthtalk’dSoeternally,. nobody could have an Opportunity to Speak in her Company. Thus they run on one after another with great Impetuofity, till I was So tired, that I was going to leave them, when I obServed a grave-looking Man at one Comer of the Room, who had hitherto been filent, began to Speak, and begg’d he might tell them a Story; which Liberty he with earnest Request (for it did not Seem to be the Defire of the Company to hear) obtain’d, and then began as fol-fows*

“ When I was a young Man, I lived “ at my Father’s Seat in the Country; it was So fituated, that I had very few Neighbours of my own Rank; I there-“ fore fometimes for my Diverfion con-verSed with the Farmers and their Wives: It was my delight to make Observations on thefe ^vulgar WretcheSy for I thought “ Want of Education render’d them almost “ of a different Species. I remember once I was at one of their Feasts, the Occafion “ was the making an Infant a Christian: but when they fancy’d themfelves in the height of their Mirth, I found that pul-“ ling to pieces, and railing at their Neighbours was all their Diverfion. I “ pitied them, that for want of having any “ Ideas but Such as Matters of Fact im-mediately prefented to their Minds, they “ were obliged to fall on this diSagreeablc Topic. We had not fat long before a young Fellow came running into the “ Room, faying a mad Bull was got loofe in the Parish, and that the Cows were “ all in danger of being bit by him; on ^ which out went all the Farmers and their

Dames to preServe their Cattle, and quite forgot their Neighbours MiSconduct. I immediately reflected how happy it was that People, who could not have a Moment’s Leisure, without being miSchie-vous., should be continually employ’d in menial Labours, where they were obliged to be of Some Service to the Communi-' ty, in ipite of their teeth.”
When the Gentleman ceaSed, the Company all stared at each other, for I believe Some of them had a confufed Notion of his Meaning; and at last a young Fellow stept up to him, and afk’d, “ What he meant; whether he defign’d to affront “ anyone?” The Gentleman gravelyan-fwered, “ That he had no Suspicion the “ telling a Story of Country Farmers “ could be any Affront to that CompanyV This was taken for Fear, and every Man in the Room at once cry’d out,“ Yes, he had “ affronted them all, and they demanded “ Satisfaction. As to what Satisfaction you “ demand. Said the Gentleman, I am rea-“ dy to give it at any time you pleaSe.” Now a general Silence enfued, and the Gentleman

Gentleman walked deliberately out of the Room, faying, He was glad to find they had So much SenSe, as to know the dif-•* ference between themSelves and Country ‘^ Boobies,” Now aroSe a contemptuous Laugh, and the former Conversation was renewed : But I followed the Gentleman who had told the Story, being quite wearied with Such Company.

Dear Camilla,

( 59 )
L E T T E R ir. Camilla to Cynthia at Bath.
Dear Cynthia, [Fromhondon,
My Father is much better than when you leSt him, and confidering his Age, enjoys his Health tolerably well. We Spend our time as agreeably as your AbSence will permit us 5 and as your last Letter, by the manner in which you tell me you Spend your time, convinces me how Surprifingly you are recovered, I may now Say .1 am perSectly happy; and the having it in my power to give you and my dear Brother the pleaSure of informing you of that Happi-neSs, is no inconfiderable Addition to the great Blessings I at preSent enjoy. Since we parted, I have accidentally contradled an Acquaintance with a Lady, with whom I am very much pleafed 5 and as she has told me her Story, I intend to fend it you Z	ill
6o L E T T E R II.
in Letters, thinking it will be more entertaining than any other thing I can write. I took it down from her own Mouth, and therefore fend it in the first Perfon, as she fpoke it. Her words were the'Se:
I WAS bred up under a Mother, whofc Precepts were rather gently instilled, than forced into my Mind; and whofe Heart, instead of being adluated by that Pride which is generally the Fountain of Advice, as well as Commands, really overflowed with an unaffeded Fondnefs towards her Offspring. By her Managerhent and Behaviour she gained my Attention, while she won my Love ; at ohce engaging my Heart, and improving my Understanding. Such a Parent you would think must necef-farily make me pafs my Infancy in all the Happinefs of which that Age is shSceptible: and yet the moment I was capable of Re-fie<stion, from this indulgent Mother arole all my Misfortunes; for I continually faw her depreffed with the deepest Melancholy, and endeavouring to hide thofe Tears she could not stifle. I shared in all her Griefs, although I was perfectly ignorant of she
CauSe
L E T T E R II. 6i
CauSe of them. But I Soon perceived that my Sympathizing in her Sorrows rather aggravated than alleviated them; and she would often fay, “ Oh, Ifabinda! steel “ your Heart against strong Affedions, and conquer that natural SoftneSs of your Mind; “ or unavoidable MiSery must attend you, “ Don’t cherish aPashon that I will, notpo-litively, fay there are no Objeds in the “ World to gratify. But this I think I can with truth affirm, that they are So « very rare, it would be PreSumption in “ you to hope to meet with So uncommon, “ So great a Bleffing.” Her Words greatly perplexed me; for Such was my natural DiSpofition, that I was amazed a Mother, and Such a Mother, should endeavour to root out of my Mind what I thought was at once both amiable and virtuous. But when I came of an Age she imagined fit to be trusted, I by my Importunity one day prevailed on her to let me into the whole Secret of her Soul; and after the vent of Some Sighs, which at first almost choaked her Words, she began in the following manner:
“ As
62 L E T T E R II.
“As I was Sole HeireSs to a great “ Estate, I heard of nothing from my “ Childhood, but the Charms of my Per-“ fon. Praifes of this kind were the only “ Language I was accustomed to; And in-“ stead of being taught that Superiority of “ Fortune becomes a CurSe, when the PoS-“ Sestbr knows not how to employ it, my “ own Parents joined with my other Flat-“ terers in endeavouring to fix Notions in “ my Head that I was all Perfection, and “ consequently could not err; which I “ found they derived rather from the Excel-“ lencc of my Beauty than from any other ‘ ‘ Endowment, though I was not without ma-“ ny Commendations of my Understanding “ and good Qualities. When I was Eighteen,
I lost my Mother, and my Father Sur-“ vived her but three Years j So that at the “ Age of One-and-twenty I was left en-“ tirely to my Self, the Mistrefs of a great “ Fortune, and strongly poffeffed with the “ Idea, that I could not be complimented,
“ for that I deServed much more than the “ warmest Imagination could Suggest in “ my PraiSe. The multitude of my fin-“ cere Lovers (as I t^n thought them)
“ for
LETTER II. 63
for Some time prevented my making any Choice ; for no Sooner did I find an inclination Secretly arifing for any one, than the Charms of Some other damped the growing Pafiion; And I was fo perplexed by the Variety offered me, that by the abundance of Power itSelf, I loft even that of distinguishing which of my Admirers I liked best. This studtuating State of Mind continued till I was Five-and-twenty, when I accidentally met your Father at a Lady’s Houfe in the Neighbourhood. He was handSome- to a miracle; 1 no Sooner Saw him than I liked him, and was fo accustomed to the Addreffes of every Man by whom I was ' Seen, that I did not at all fear his immediately becoming one of my Train. But as it happened that he had for half a year fancied himSelf very much in love with the young Harriat, the Lady’s Daughter at whoSe HouSe I first Saw ' him, he did not So Soon profeSs him-' Self my Lover as I expected. This was
■	the first time my Vanity had ever the
■	least ReaSon to be piqued, and conSe-' quently I became the more uneaSy; and
“ what
64. L E T T E R If.
** what is very unaccountable, I never had “ SenSe enough to find out by Reflection, “ that I had any Such Pafilon as Vanity; “ 'till its being thus disappointed, forced “ me to feel by the Pain it gave me, that “ I was pofTefTed of it. My Rival was “ very pretty, and her Fortune fuch as your Father had great reaSon to be con-“ tented with; but as I took all Opportu-“ nities of throwing mySelf in his way, “ and contrived every Method (except teL “ ling him of it) to let him fee how much “ I liked him, and although the Task is “ very di£icult to convince People that they “ themfelves are the OhjeSis of Admiration^ “ yet in about a Week, by great Assiduity, “ I left him no remaining Doubt, but that “ I, and, what was much more prevailing, “ my Fortune, was at his Command, pro-^ vided he would forfake Harriat, and “ think of me only. The Thoughts of “ my great Estate immediately took poS-“ Session of his whole Mind, and the Glare “ of my Superiority in that refpect dazzled “ his Eyes to fuch a degree, as made all his " former Mistrefs’s Charms vanish and fade ‘‘ into nothing, whilst he became (at least
L E T T E R ir. 65
in appearance) entirely devoted to my Love.”
** Now my utmost Vanity was Satisfied by the removal of every Obstacle that obstructed it j Nature began to break forth, and Education gave way to its Superior Force. Wax made warm with Fire could not be more Soft and tender than my DiSpofition originally was. But yet by being continually accustomed to the utmost Gratifications of Vanity, my Mind for Some time Seemed compleatly Satisfied, and my Inclinations to Love lay concealed even from mySelf. But your Father’s Charms very foon inSpired me with a Pastion So fimple and unmixed, that my whole PleaSure was centered in the Thoughts that my Affections were returned, and our Love mutual. Blinded by my own Pastion, I hastened to make the Man I fancied I had Such reafon to esteem. Master of me, and my
■	Fortune. I painted in my own Mind
^ Scenes of constant Love, and lasting
■	TenderneSs; and made no doubt but I
■	was arrived to the highest degree of hu-

man HappineSs. My Hushand’s Beauty ‘‘ was what first inSpired me with Love,
“ and unfortunately for myfelf, my Ima-“ gination was lively enough to give him,
“ in my opinion, every thing I wiShed him “ poffeffed of. I thought his Understand*
“ ing equalled his Beauty, and mistook that Softnefs which entirely arofe from the Formation of a regular Set of Fea-“ tures for real Tendernefs, and an unaf* “ fetsted Goodnefs of Mind. But my be- .

“ perience enough of the World, or Com-“ mand enough of my own Bastions, to ‘‘ have judged of him as he was, I Should ** either have conquered my Inclination, or brought myfelf to have been contented “ with his Behaviour. But I have conti-nually languished for Imposhbilities, and ** given way to Defires as madly, as if I was to expect a Crop of Corn from a “ paved Street, or gilded Palaces to arife in barren, uninhabited Mountains.

wards my Husband; while he is not only incapable of returning it, but de* SpiSes my Folly; and has not the least; Idea of what it means. He is a very honest Man, and I believe is very constant to me; I don’t know that he is guilty of any one Vice; and yet his being totally unSuSceptible of tender Senlations, renders me more miSerable, than if his Adions were Such as would make me hate him. If he was not the Man I am obliged to live with, I could now get the better of this unreasonable Wish. But as I daily See him before my Eyes, I am quite unhappy. For he at once keeps up an Inclination which makes me long to find him capable of Fondnefs, and yet at the fame time proves by every Adion he is not So. NoW, Ifabinda^ this is the ReaSon I would have you take pains to keep your'Mind from being too much Softned, and, by my Example, guard against the Rock on which I have Split. I should not have declared my Sentiments fb freely to* yon .of your Father; but that ! think every C 2	*J thing
68
LETTER II.
thing is neceffary to caution you against “ being miserable.”
By this time Supper was on the Table; and my Father’s entering the Room put an end to our DiScourSe.
When I was leSt alone, I began to reflect on what my Mother had told me j I could not but think that was I to meet with Such a Behaviour as my Father’s to her, in a Man I loved, it would make me unhappy; for he constantly went out as Soon as he had breakfasted; came home to Dinner; after which, he flept ’till it was time to go abroad again; Seldom staid out to Supper 5 but as Soon as that was over, hurried to Bed, as if the living in the Same HouSe was a ReaSon why People Should never Speak to each other. I began to form in my Mind a Resolution that nothing should ever tempt me to marry ; but then it Suddenly came into my Head, that I should never follow my Mother’s Example, in being charm’d with Beauty alone; and shat therefore in a Man of SenSe, I might meet with the Gratification of my utmost Tendernefs ^ and be '	J	happy
L E T T E R II. 69
happy instead of miSei;able, by inclulging the Softest Pastion I was capable of. My Imagiitation immediately formed a Creature whoSe Mij?d was perfectly the reverSe of my Father’s, capable of all the little Refinements in which true Loye chiefly confists ; and I was generous enough to my Self to make no doubt of being quite Secure of pollefling this lovely Creature of rny own Frain. But I will not trouble you with the various Turns of my Thoughts that Night; for what between Compaflion for my Mother, and Joy at the great Siic-ceSs of my own Paflion;^ (for I made the Object of it do and fay whatever would pleaSe me best) there \yas Such a wild Medley in my Mind, aa would be difficult to make intelligible to another j but the next Morning gave a Sudden Turn to all our Affairs. For my Father, as he was going out after Breakfast, fell down in a Fit of an Apoplexy j he was a fat, grofs, Man; and although he never got drnnk, yet he had always indulged himSelf ip eat-r ing and drinking to the very Brink of In-tenaperanee; So that it fell So heavy upon him, that the most Speedy Relief we could C 3	get.
70 LETTER II.
get, proved ineffectual; and in leSs than hdf an Hour he expired. My Mother behaved on that Occafion as is uSual; she had lost the Object of her Paffion, and for the pre^ shnt quite forgot it had never been rer turned; So that for the Time she felt as great Grief, as if she had the strongest ReaSons in the World for it. But the finding herSelf freed from that Perturbation of Mind which had been occafipned by the continual Sight of a Perfon whom she loved contrary to her own ReaSon, shpn ah leviated her Sorrow* and rendered her much calmer than she had been from her first Acquaintance with her Hushand. She then turned all her Thoughts on me, and I made it my study to pay her the ^e-fpectful Duty, joined with the warmest Affection.
W E were in the Country, and led a retired Solitary Life; where although we had no great PleaSures, yet the being perfectly (free from every thing that could ruffle or disturb usyin reality, fully compensated the Want of them. But I was young, not yet above Seventeen, and Soon grew weary

I wanted to go into, the World j and although I did hot know k; I certainly had Soqie latent Hope; that I Should 0ne day meet with a Lover, ^ofr feffed 6f all She amiable Qualities which rny own Inlaginatlori Suggested to be heceS-fary to foirri‘ i rnutua! r-TappineSs.

attended me : And although I should have hated mySelf, if I could have thought of dallying with the Pashpn of a Man of Senfe, in order to make-;.hinr uneafy,; yet I confefs I did not think it any great Crim^ to. let thefe Monkeys play over a few of their Tricks, for my Divcrfion: whilst I was convinced could they have fe-parated the Idea of my Fortune from my Perfon,. my Power to give them either Pleafure or Pain would equally have vanished into nothing. It is almost incredible what Sort of trifling Actions, and Ijonfepfical Ingidents, thefe fort, pf Men take for Encouragement; and from which they imagine a Woman obliged to fpend her whole Life with them. Distant Civility they take for a modest Concealment of a Paffion; Rudenefs they construe into Love; if by chance you look at them, you are eagerly deflrous of engaging their Affection; and if by accident you overlook, them, you are timorous lest they should engage yours, and cowardly fly from thoSe Charmd. which must otherwife unavoidably captivate your Heart. And then their manner
of
L E T T E R II. 73
jo£ declaring the Violence of their Pafiion is ridiculous, almost beyond comparison.
One of my Sparks, after he had drank Tea with me two or three times, and I had perhaps taken a Pinch of Snuff out of his Box, or given him one out of mine, with Some other fuch Marks of Love., happened one Day to find me alone : He fat down, blest his Stars for the favourable Opportunity, and then remained a full Oerter of an Hour in perfect Silence, staring me all the while full in the Face with So affured a Look, as convinced me he was thinking thus in himSelf; “ How “ happy are you to meet with me ! but whilst I am here, make haste to accept “ the Honour Ido you, or there are enow that will be glad of it, and take the Blefiing from you.” But I am certain my Eyes were very faithful to me, and th^t I did not expreSs the least Affection for him in my Words; So that the Gentleman was totally disappointed, and went stem me in Such great Anger, that he reported all over the Town I was a finished Coquette.
Another
74 L E T T E R II.
Another thought to gain me by mere dint of Impudence, and told me I wronged my own Heart in pretending to conceal my Love, for he read it hi my Looks ; giving me thany hints how much more my Misfortune than his it would be, if I continued to act fo foolishly ; and then began to kick his Heels, and hum a Song in a careleSs manner, as much as'to fay; “ If
you think you can give me any Pain, “ you are mightily mistaken; for my Value “ for you is not So great as to put me into “ your power.” This Behaviour really diverted meV and I could not help laughing at him to Such a degree, as made him quit the Room, and perfectly forget how rfiuch I was in love with him. He was reckoned handSome, and indeed had as-^mlich Beauty afr could be in a- Face that was- unanimatfed; and a Countenance in which you could read nothing, but Fool.
A Third approached me with a Solemn Air and a majestick Pace; and expected I should Submit to the Opinion he had conceived of his own Dignity. Fur fome^
time
letter II. 75
time I was a little at a lofs to find oilt, whether this Man had not Some Affectioii for me, becauSe I was So very much mistaken as to impute his Behaviour to a Diffidence in himSelf, and a Fear of off^ding me by a Declaration of his Love: but by ol Conversation I had with him one day, I found out by the Sentiments he exprestcd, that what had the Appearance of Modesty, in reality arofe only from the Value he fet on his own IVferit, and to his Pride indulged to Such a Height, as made him Scorn the Thoughts of condescending to bear a RefuSal. This was to me the most ridiculous Charader in the World, and the GiddineSs of Youth made me foolifh enough to take a pleaSure in endeavouring tor humble his Pride, and trying tcr alhire the Gentleman to declare his Pafiion, only that I might have the Satisfaction of piquing his Vanity, and lowering the great Opinion he had of himSelf. Two or three Scenes that passed between us, (inn which I made Advances only to bring about my own PurpoSe, and he appeared timorous and fearful of being caught) would really have been diverting to a third Perfon ; and it
makes
76 L E T T E R Ih
makes me laugh whenever I reflect oa them.
At last the Same Pride which made him look on being rejected with Such Dread, prevailed on him to believe it was very improbable that fijch a Difajier Should ever happen ; And I Succeeded So far as to have it in my power to shew him, I did not think him So charming as he thought him-felf. However^ as to humbling hini k was utterly imposhble, for he only deSpiSed my Judgment, and arrived to an utter Contempt of me. yo,u See I do not Scruple owning to you my Folly; nor do I think, if I had been a little older, there could have been any ExcuSe for Such a trifling Behaviour. Thi,s was the only Man I really was a Coquette to, and yet he was the only one who did not report me to be fo ; for he endeavoured to make the World believe, that it was his own fault he did not v^arry me. If I was to tell you the Number of Coxcombs who fancied I gaw them Encouragement, whilst I never had one ferious Thought about them, it would be endlefs ^ and befides thete was fo little Variety in
thek
L E T T E R II.
their Charad:ers, that it would be only repeating the Same thing over again.
My Mother was greatly delighted t6 fee I was not inclined to fix my Affections, and file began to hope I should go through the World without it; but I was almost weary of this manner of Life, and was made very uneaSy from the Spite of Some People, whom I could never find out; for they took Opportunities of stabbing me in the dark, and made me feel the Blow, while the Hand that gave it was concealed. I never appeared abroad, or went into any public Place, but I was Sure the next Morning to receive a Letter from an unknown Hand, in which every Part of my Behaviour, and even my DreSs was pull’d to pieces, and this under the pretence of the greatest Friendship^ and the most tender Regard for my Welfare. I had feveral Hints given me, that I had got the Reputation of being even a Jilt, and that, if I did not leave off that way of Life, no Man of SenSe would ever fpeak to me: nay,
on«
78 L E T T E R IL
one of theSe good-natured Epistles went StJ far as to tell me, that it was shrewdly SuS-peded, Mr. Such-a-one (naming the ridL culous proud Man I have already told you of) would not have forSaken me, if I had not granted him every thing in my powers My Mother laughed at this Malice, and astiired ,me it was nothing but Womens Envy at my having more Lovers than they thought came to my share 5 or perhaps that this last was wrote by the Man him-felf, who being hurt by my Treatment of him, took this Method of Revenge. But Shame, and a Fear of being thought ill of, got the better of every thing she could Say, and I began to rested on my own Folly in indulging a tristing AmuSement, at the Expence of laying mySelf open to the Venom of malicious Tongues. This dwelt So strongly upon my Mind, that it made me as unhappy as if I had had Some real CauSe, till an Accident turned my Thoughts another way, and made me quite forget all theSe nonfenfical Letters, as much as if I had never received them.

I have a great Compassion for her Mother, for I cannot form an Idea of any Life So miserable, as that of being continually with PerSons, whom we have an involuntary Inclination to love, whilst they every mb nute give us undoubted Proofs of being totally incapable of returning it. IfaUndd.% Youth is the fame ExcuSe for her dealing with Coxcombs, as Infancy is for playing with Rattles. But I hope to hear no more of them; for I look upon a Woman, who has any ConverSe vrith Such Sort of Fellows, after She is Twenty, in full as ridiculous

82 LETTER HI,
I W e N T at nine in the Morning to the Pump-Room, when the playing of the Mu-fic, joined to the Spirit of the warm Water, raiSed my Imagination, and threw me into that agreeable State of Mind, which makes us fuSceptible of every little Plea-fure that Accident throws in our way. You know I never was ambitious of a general Acquaintance, and here I have but very little ; for which reafon I uSually Sit down in a Corner, and am left at free liberty to make what Reflections I pleafe. The Harmony of Mufic cannot filence thofe People, whoSe Voices make the most agreeable Sound in their own Ears : and I observed Numbers round me, who were talking with an Earnestnefs, which to me, ss a Stranger^ Seemed to flow from Something worthy the greatest Attention. But amongst the various People who were there affembled,^ the whole Conversation I heard ter Ibme time, was comprized in three or four Sentences; Such as the Warmth or CoidneSs of the Weather, and notwithstanding it was one of the finest Days I ever Saw, yet tiffs was one Remark^j that
it
LETTER III. 83
it always rained at Bath‘s another was, the Glaffes of Water which each particular had drank that Morning; what Ladies were early or late at the Pump-Room, with what mighty BufineSs had kept them up the Night before, to prevent their regular Attendance on that	their Health,
I Cannot but Say, I often wished talking incestantly was not looked upon to be So essential a Part of human Happinefs, as to render two or three minutes Ceffation of that liiighty PleaSure, perfectly impracticable even to thoSe, who have nothing to Say. At last I obServed that two Ladies who had GurtaSyed with great Good-humour to one half of the Company, and Scornfully overlooked the other half, were staring me full in the Face, as if they had Seen Soma Monster. Curiofity led me to hearken to them, as I Seemed to be the Objed; oi# which their Attention was mostly fixed, and I overheard one of them Say to the other; “ I never Saw her before ; I don’t observe that any one of our Acquain-tance,that is, anyone worth notice Speaks D 2	“to
84 LETTER III.
to her.” On 'which her Companion replied; “ .Dis certainly Some Creature., “ Some tnftgnijicatit Wretch., who being ‘‘ tired with having nobo4y to admire her but herSelf, has just made her first Jour-ney to Bath, in order to display her own AukwardneSs, and be the DiverSion “ of all the good Company here.” Reciprocal Contempt has Something in it, which is always ridiculous; and I could not help Smiling at the thought^, hpw theSe Peoples Vanity, in their own Imagination, lifted them to the Clouds, whilst in the Eyes of others they were placed ainongst the lowest pf humari Race.
. I Blest my good Fortune, which had not curfed me with Such Acquaintance, whilst they were pitying, or rather laughing, at my Misfortune in not having that only., that grand Stamp of Merit; and I could not forbear thinking, that nothing Js So justly the Qbjecst of Scorn as a Pigmy, that imagines itSelf a Qiant, or a Monkey, which becauSe it mimicks the Adlions, and heecmes the Rival of the lowest part of the human Species, fancies itfelf on a level
LETTER III. 8j
ivith all Mankind. And I really think an Observation I heard the other day is true, 'uiz. that InSolence and Impertinence generally take their riSe from Some Srnall Hint or Suspicion of Demerit in ourSelves; For Sure no one would be So mad, as to leave the firm and Sure Footing of Merit (vrhich when attended with Modesty, must be ate lowed eveti by the Envious^ and admired by others) to totter on the Slippery Banks of Folly aUd Impertinence, where every Step is dangerous, and all Beholders would willingly throw the poor Wretch to the ground, only for their own Diver Sion. Little Boys, when they forfake a broad dry Path, to wade up to their Knees through Dirt and Mire, are not more childish than thefe Jine Ladies, when,- instead of endeavouring to gain Esteem and Admiration by a Gondudf worthy of them, they Spend their whole Lives in affeOing a Superiority, which it Would not cost them So much really to attain. But I have obferved, that all Pride, by turning the Head giddy with either real or imaginay Weight, overlooks the Steps leading up to its own Gratification.
D 3	A
86 LETTER III.
A S c E N E I was once Witnefs of in the Country, in my Opinion was a strong Pidlure of human Life. A poor Girl by being always told from her Cradle, that fhe was very handSome, grew mad with Vanity, and fancied herSelf a Queen. Her whole Delight was placed in gathering up Rags and Patches to make her a Train Suitable to the great Dignity of her imagined Station : but the Page being wanting to hold up this Emblem of Grandeur, I have mySelf Seen her walk through ploughed Grounds, dragging her long Train after her, till at last being clogged with Dirt, it became So heavy. She was unable to carry it any farther, and funk down under the Weight of this her coveted, patched up, fancied Sign of Honour and StatelineSs. The Boys ufed to hoot her as fhe ptissed^ and call her by way of derifion, her Majesty of the Embroidered Lraiti. I Seldom pafs a Day,, but this poor Girl is brought to my Renlembrance, and Sometimes cannot help laughing, when I fee people strutting and Sweating under the Weight of Seme Superkidty they have been So good as
to
LETTER IIL 87
to give themSelvesj whilst they appear to me ia the Situation of this poor mad Creature 5 and I look on them but as So many Queens of the Embroidered Lrain.
But to leave this Subjedf: From the Pump the greatest part of die Company adjourned to the Coffee-Room, which is frequented by both Gentlemen and Ladies. Here the Conversation was So mix’d, and the Subjects So various, that it w'-as difficult to distinguisti the Voice or Sentiments of one PerSon from angther. I could hardly forbear thinking, I was in that Creek of Nova Zemhla Mr. Bickerjiaff mentions in his Extract from Sir	Mandeville'%
Journal, where the Cold was So intenfe, as to freeze the very Words as they were uttered. The Sun shone very bright, and I was almost led to imagine, that by its Warmth and Vigour, the Speeches which had been long congealed by Cold, were now melting in my Ears, to which only I could impute the Variety of Sounds which at once invaded me. Religion, Politics, Gaming, Dancing, Dreffing, in short almost every Topic of Pifcojarfe the Lan-D 4	guage
88 LETTER III.
guage affords, was diScuffed; and it was very comical to hear at once the Adions of Statesmen canvaSs’d, and the exad Manner of pinning a Ribband, or placing a Patch, eloquently criticized on. And yet by one Circumstance fpoken of by Sir John^ the Frost feemed yet to continue : “For “ whether he was heard or no, every Man
was fenfible he Spoke as well as ever.”
After this. Scene I went home to Breakfast, where you may be Sure I Spent my time agreeably; for your dear Brother met me there in perfed Health, and I am fure it would be needleSs to add, in great Good-humour.
From thence I proceeded to the Room?, where the Croud was So great, it was; with Some difficulty I could move. It was ob-Servable, that, altho’ the Heat occafioned by the great Concourfe of People was excessive, yet all the Ladies were in Capuchins, Bonnets, Muffs (which latter \tere worn aiSo by Some of the Gentlemen) and in every Drefs which could be contrived for Warmth, as much as if, they shad really
been
LETTER III; 89
been in ISlova Zembla. I afked an Acquaintance what could be the meaning that People contrived to clothe themSelves So inconveniently. She laughed, and replied, it was the Safhionable Morning DreSs, and fhe did not in the least doubt, but Custom might introduce the wearing Er-min and Fur in the hottest Country in Europe : Sor that fhe was Satisfied the Gratification of Vanity would take from the greatest part of the World the Senfe of feeling even Heat or Cold. I did not go near the Roly-poly or Card-Tables, for you know I have no fort of Pleafure in Play; but I found all thoSe who were walking about, or rather standing still for want of room to stir, complained violently of the DiSagreeablenefs of being thus thrust and Squeezed, and yet did not at all endeavour to get out of it. This put me in mind of Dr. Swiff ^ fat Man in the Croud, who complained greatly of the Uneafinefs of being in the PreSs; and yet did not remember, till reminded by one who stood next him, that he could without any trouble remove his own Pain, and make more room for others. I overheard feveral Ladies
9© LETTER III.
dies give it as a ReaSon for enduring this great Punishment, that the Variety there relaxed their Thoughts, and kept them from the Pain of TBinking, which was not good with the Waters. I could not help having a Curiofity to hear the Conversation of whoever made this Speech; and I generally found, it was much ado about nothing, and that they were only putting themSelves to a very unneceffary Trouble, to prevent that Pain which Seemed not likely of befalling them, even though they had laboured as much (as a Lady once did to learn to love Reading) to have procured it.
I WAS foon tired of being here, and in the Afternoon went to make a Vifit: The Lady of the HouSe was very young and gay; she was just married, and had given a Fortune of ten thouSand Pounds to a Man whom she neither loved nor hated : but he could make her a Settlement anSwerable to it, had a good Character, her Friends thought it right to have her Settled in the World, and she had too much Indifference in her Temper, not to comply with what they defired; her whole Time was trifled
away
L E T T E R IIL 91
away in DreSs and Company, which she thought Such mighty BufineSs, that one continual Hurry ran through her whole Life j and her HouSe was the common Rendezvous of all thoSe who, like herSelf, fancy themSelves employed by being in a Room with a great many People, and always thrust into a Croud becauSe they have nothing elSe to do. Elmira this Lady’s Sister, who lived with her, will anTwer to the Description of a Beauty; and yet I can’t fay she looks like one : for she has a Set of regular Features added to a fine Complexion, and very good brown Hair, and yet Such an Infenfibility appears in her Countenance, that I rather lament So much is thrown away than am pleafed with what she really has. However, she is reckoned handSome, and has Some Admirers; for there are in the World Men who are taste-leSs enough to like by Rule ; and being ignorant of all thoSe little UameleSs Elegancies which are the greatest Charms of even Beauty itSelf, go away well pleafed with their Mistresses, when they can deScribe them to thein Companions in what they diink an amiable Light. Corydon, a young
Gentleman
93 LETTER III. Gentleman of this Sort, fat by Elmira; he took all Opportunities of making complte ment& to her; and yet I thought it was ealily to be perceived, that he was much more pleafed with his own Speeches, than with the Objedl to whom he addressed them. It would be endlefs to run through all the Company in the Room, for it was quite full: but I happened to fit near Co^ rydon and Elmira^ which made me more particularly obServe them. An agreeable fenssble Woman was next me, and addressed most part of her Conversation to me; and on talking of Variety of Subjedls, took out of her Pocket a Letter fhe had received that Morning from a young Lady, wrote in VerSe, and defired my Opinion of it. The Thoughts were all nervous and strong, the Expressions pure and elegant, and the VerSe stowed with the greatest EaSe imaginable ; So that I could not avoid expressing my Admiration of it. Corydon and Elmira overheard what we were talking of, and begged, if there were no Secrets in the Letter, they might have the pleaSure of hearing it. I know nothing enrages People who are void of Taste So much as Seeing
letter III. 93
ing they are found out; and therefore, with the Lady’s Leave, immediately read it aloud to them; but Such an Inundation of Envy and low Spite burst from the Lips of thefe two People, (who by the Injudicious are called gooLnatuPd. becaufe they are filly) as made me figh at the Malignity there is in human Nature : and yet there was fomething fo ridiculous in both their Manner and Words, that I could not help Smiling. Elmira Said, She thought writing Poetry did not become a Woman, there was Something too maSculine in it; on which Corydon replied, with a Sneer com-poSed of Folly and Malice, “ Do you think. Madam, thofe Lines are really a Wo-“ man’s ? I dare fay this Lady has Some “ Hushand, Father, or Brother, who gave “ them to her, though they pafs in her Name; for without Learning, it is im-possible for any one to write So well.” I afked the Gentleman, if he imagined none could exprefs their Thoughts in any Language who did not understand feveral ^ To which he made no Anfwer, but fell to adjusting his Cravat, rubbing his Beard, and repeating Some Latin Verfes, in which I
was
94- LETTER IIL
was afterwards told by a Gentleman in Company, he committed many Blunders; and concluded with affirming, he was Sure thoSe VerSes were wrote by a Man. It was not worth while to fay any more. Elmira did not agree with Cory don ^ that Women could not write; but fixing her Eyes on a Gkfs oppofite her, faid She believed fome Women might be capable of writing, if they had not Judgment enough to know it was not proper for them. Then followed an Argument between the Gentleman and the Lady, which had the Superiority in point of Understanding, Man or Woman ? I Sat a little while by way of Diverfion, and plainly perceived that Corydon was reSolved to go through the Difficulty of finding a Wife fillier than himfelf j and that Elmira was equally refolute never to marry a Man who liked her for her Face, unlefs he had alfo So deep a Penetration as to find out her Genius. But as I did not know how long this Conversation might last, I Soon grew tired : For although SenSe and Truth, when all is exhausted that can be faid on a Subject, will find a Period; the bottomleSs, the inexhaustible Fund of Nonfenfe, (eSpe-.
cially *
L E T T E R IIL 95
daily when Supported by an Eag^rneSs that ariSes from Envy) can find no end. I therefore took my Leave, and left them to carry on their dispute as high as they pleaSed; whilst I was happy enough to have it in my power to eScape being any longer stun’d with it. I left them with a Refolution, that for the future, whenever I had a mind to amufe myfelf, I would go amongst People of Senfe, who alone can trifie well; where* the fillier Part of Mankind affect to fcorn every thing that is not wife; and from an Endeavour to Shew their own Understandings, eternally teaze their unhappy Companions with their laboured, heavy, trite Sentiments.
I HAD not been returned to my Lodgings half an Hour before Valentiyie brought home two Gentlemen of his Acquaintance to Spend the Evening with us. You well know, Camilla.^ whatever Company is agreeable to him, is ib to me: And I met them with a ChcarfulneSs which always attends the Certainty of being uSed well. That restrained Ceremony which Seems to conceal Some lurking Thought, that if
known
96 LETTER III.
known might shame the Poffeffor, and that RudeneSs which every moment declares a Mind entirely void of Shame, are to me equally detestable : And I every day rested on my HappineSs, that I am married to a Man whoSe own Behaviour Sets an Example to all his Companions to treat me with real good Breeding. One of theSe Gentlemen has a Fund of Wit and Entertainment in him I never met with before. His Conversation is at once So lively, one can hardly imagine he has time to think, and yet So Solid and judicious, it is almost im-poffible to conceive but every Thought must ariSe from the most deliberate Restedlion. The only Foible I could perceive in him was a frequent Sneer he put on, when he was talking of others. He often put me in mind of two Lines in a Tranllation of Perjius‘% Satires ; where Horace is thus described :
‘The Croud he fneePd, but fneePd with fucb a Grace^
It pafid for downright innocence of Pace,
LETTER III. 97
A Delight ill a low Ridicule I thought beneath a Man of his Parts, and was really Sorry to SuSpedt he had any the least Failing. But what made the Scene diverting, was the other Gentleman’s anfwering full as well to two Lines in another Satire of the fame Author, where the Mirth of Fools is thus displayed :
On each bold Nofe a wrinkling Sneer is founds And quavering Laughter echoes loud -around.
When the oA^ had dohe Sneering, the other always began to imitate him; by which means he had the misfortune of wrinkling his Nofe, when it should have been Smooth; and quavering with Laughter, when the Jest was over. Thus the Jest often falls on himfelf, and he is in the Same Cafe with Pierroty who, when he fancies he has nothing more to do than to get fight of Harlequiny and mimick his Step, to be able to follow him in all his Windings and Turnings, often finds that for want of the fame powerful Wand which the other poffeffes, he is left in diSgrace, and ex-pofed to the Ridicule of the whole Au-V o t.

But after the Gentlemen were gonCj Valentine informed me, that the Man whofe Understanding I So much applauded, Would be glad never to have an Opportunity of sheering ; that he is a true Friend to every Man he finds worthy of his Esteem, is always glad to meet with an Objedt of it, and only laughs instead of crying, to keep up his own Good-humour^ and that of the Company: But that the ©ther Gentleman envies the very People he affedls to defpife ; and is a,puller-down of others, in hopes by that means to raife his own little Value the higher.

Camilla to Cynthia at the Bath.
Dear Cynthia, [Fromhondionl
AS I know you will have a great Cu-riolity to hear the Remainder of Ifa-bindEs Story, I will make no Preface to detain you from it. She went on thus:
EMIL I A, 2. young Lady with whom I had been very intimate from the time I came to Town, called on me one Morning, and invited me to Spend the Evening with her, to See a Gentleman her Brother was to bring to Sup with him at her HouSe, who was reckoned one of the most ingenious Men of the Age, Natural Curiofity to fee a Perfon So remarkable, inclined me to accept the Invitation, I thanked my Companion for endeavouring to amuSe me, and waited on her at the Hour appointed.
E 2	There
loo LETTER IV.
There were Seven af us in Company : how^ ever, I expedfed from the Character I had heard of this Gentleman, (whotn for the future I Shall call Phiiocles) that all of them would be modest and diffident of them-felves where he waSj and place their chief Delight in hearing him talk. But I was greatly disappointed; for I never heard fo many People talk together, and fuch a confufed Jargon as there was that Evening, in all my Life-time. So that Phiiocles had not an Opportunity to fpeak one word. Indeed most of the Converfation was addressed to him, but without waiting for, or defiring an Anfwer.
I Could not forbear refieding all night on the Oddnefs of this Scene, and the next morning went early to my Friend, and de-fired her to tell me what could tempt all thofe People to babble to fuch a degree, that one could not have the pleafure of hearing Phiiocles Speak. She Smiled, “ and “ told me that fhe intended to have given *‘ -me an agreeable Entertainment by having ‘‘ only her Brother and Phiiocles of the Party; and that the rest, by a mistake
of
LETTER . IV. loi
of the Servants, got in by chance. But, continued she, the moment they Saw who was here, there was no possibility of getting them out of the Houfe without being downright rude. For you must know tjiis is a Tax all People must pay, who have the pleafure of Philoclef^ Acquaintance. The very few Judicious who know him, admire and love him ; and from thence he has got the reputa-tioB of being a Man of great Parts. Fame itSelf barely does him justice; but you must imagine the number of Fools who pretend they admire him, are too tasteleSs really to enjoy his Conversation, or even to find out, had they not been told So, that he has any Superiority over the rest of Mankind : For all his Ideas are too strong, and his Wit too refined to be understood by the Multitude. He is no great talker; for he is above the low Vanity of shewing his Par's, and whatever he Says Seems to stow from tie generous Motive of giving others pleasure, whilst the Consideration of himlelf appears to be totally negleded. Indeed it is impossible he should find Subjetsts E 3	“ enougA

enough of DiScourSe to be continually, “ talking; fince he is equally incapable of venting NonSenSe, or of giving way to the bafe Malignity which makes the Im-perfedions and Frailties of others the Objects of Mirth and Ridicule. ThoSe alone which are hurtful to Society incur his Satire, which is always as gentle as it is just. The only Mark by which we can know it, is pointed at Mens Faults, and does not take its rife from either Envy or Hatred to the Men themSelves. Befides, he has Such a Command of Words, that he exprelTes his Thoughts “ in fewer by far than are necessary for others to make thenifelves understood; So that the Same Sentiment which would employ Some Men a confiderable time even to make it intelligible, in his Mind would be at once conceived and cloathed, and then brought to light with Such eaSe, that it would appear to have been thought on by him ever fince he was ^ capable of thinking,”
This advantageous Character of PhK kcks made me eafily comprehend, why

Men oS SenSe Should delight to be continually with hirn : But still I was at a loSs to know, why Such Sort of People as thoSc that stun’d him with their Npife the Night before, should prefer his Company to that of others; and on telling my Thoughts t^ Emilia^ she replied, “ That she thought “ she had explained that to me, by telling

IThanked Etnilia for her Information, and told her, if she could procure an Opportunity of letting me See Philocles^ when we might enjoy his Conversation, I should be obliged to her for indulging me in that Pleafure; and on her promiSe to bring it about as Soon as poffible, I took my Leave. The Interval between this and my feeing him again. Seem’d as So much time lost; for as this was my only Point in view, all other things appeared as nothing to me; and yet I was So ignorant, I imputed this entirely to a Defire of conver-fing, and being acquainted with a Man of So extraordinary a Charadler, as Emilia had given of Philocles^ without the least SuSpicion of my Heart’s being at all concerned in it:
However,
io6 LETTER IV.
However, my Joy was almost incredible the next time Emilia told me I might Spend the Evening with him.
A T this Second Interview, She took care to'stiut out all Intruders; and we were really merry without NoiSe, and entertained without Malice; the Satisshdlion of the whole Company Seemed to be placed in pleafing each other, and, without the restraint of any ridiculous Ceremony, true PoliteneSs reigned. In short, we pasted our Time So agreeably, that I wish’d my whole Life could be Spent in the Same manner, nor did I know a Wish beyond it.
Tho’ Men often fall in our Esteem, from our having previousty heard great Characters of them; yet Philocles more than anfwered my Expectations. The JudiciouS-neSs and real Wit with which his whole Conversation abounded, could be equalled by nothing but the SenSibility of his Looks; and his Eyes and Tongue Seemed to be at strife which should have the greatest share in uttering that good Senfe, which was contained within.

Now, instead of amufing my felf with Coxcombs, I delighted in being alone; for all Company grew irkfome to me; and when I was obliged to be in any, I was So abfent in my Thoughts, that I often made wrong AnSwers ; and all my Acquaintance wondered what could be the Caufe of fuck an Alteration. I was greatly perplexed to find out whether Emilia was not my Rival; She feemed fo eloquent in Phihcles'^ PraiSes, that I feared she liked him (indeed I thought feeing and loving him was the fame thing) yet she did not feem in that confu-fion when she talked of him, as I should have been, had I but mentioned his Name. This Was fome fmall Comfort, but yet I was not fatisfied; I formed a thouSand Schemes in my Head to find out the Truth, but could get no Opportunity of putting any of shem in execution. At last my
Friend
io8 LETTER IV.
Friend (who was older, and knew more of the World than I did) perceived my Un-eafineSs, and kindly relieved me, by assuring me, “ that, altho’ she had a great esteem
for Philocles, yet her Heart had been “ therwiSe engaged a long time.” I was as much rejoiced at her telling me this, as if I had been Sure of his Inclination from that moment, and this had been the only Obstack in my way to what I thought Hap-pineSs,
P HIL OGLES now poffeffed all my Thoughts; and I had no other Idea of Plea-fure, but what was to ariSe from the feeing and converfing with him. I grew So pen-five, that my Mother Soon perceived it; and ^s her greatest fear was my having any violent Attachment, She was not long perplexed to guefs the Caush of my Anxiety; her Importunity extorted from rpe ^ Con-feshon of the Truth. This she looked on as a fign I should be \yilling to take her Advice; but I verily believe the true Motive of my not concealing it from her, was the great pleafure I took in talking of my favourite Subject, and the Impoffibility I
founcS
L E T T E R IV. idg
found of attending to any other. Sh« leemed pleaSed with the Description I gavp of Philocles., and assured me; “ That if, “ befides his other Accomplishments, he “ was capable of a strong Affedion, and “ choSe me for the Objed of it, she should “ have no Objedions to my following ihy
own Inclinations.”
ILooked on this as an Approbation of my Paffion; and as I thought I read in my Lover’s Looks, that I was far from being indifferent to him, I began to flatter my Self a little time would bring about all I wished. Emilia was So good-natured, that she took every Opportunity, without putting me to the confufion of ashing it, of letting me fee my Lover; and he Soon ashed Leave to vifit me. I did not hefitate a moment in granting his Request, nor indeed was it in my power.
N o w the very distant hope that I might See him but one quarter of an hour, was fuflicient to keep me at home the whole Day; and the first time he came, I hap-pened to be alone, This toerview entrely
finished
IIO LETTER IV.
finished his Conquest; and it would have been fruitless to have endeavoured the struggling with a Pastion, which Refistance would have only inflamed the inore. Wc talked of indifferent Subjects, nor did he once mention the word Love: This I imputed to his ReSpect for me; and it is impoffible to deScribe the Happinefs I enjoyed during the time he was with me. Two Hours appeared to my Imagination but two Minutes; and I wondered how he could leave me fo Soon. I was almost tempted to have defired him to stay longer, and would have given the w^orld for any plau-fible ExcuSe to have done fo. He left me as in a Dream; and, instead of any power to fix my Thoughts on what Subject I pleated, my Fancy wandered through every Word he had Said; and his every Look and Gesture feemedas prefentto me.
I Found fault in my Mind with every Part of my Behaviour ; fometimes I was afraid my Love had appeared too plain, and I should be the Obj^ of Philocles'^ Contempt. Then Shame and Confufion tormented me to fuch a degree, that I re-I	Solved
LETTER IV. Ill
Solved the next time I Saw him (whatever Pangs it cost me) to conceal my Pastion, Then in a moment, without any ReaSoif for changing my Opinion, I refledled on Some trifling thing I had Said, which I fancied would give him reaSon to believe I had no liking to him at all; and consequently make him endeavour to cure that great PaJJion I was convinced he had for me. Now as quick as Lightning I changed my Resolution, wished he would come back again, that I might even own my Love, lest the endeavouring to conceal it, should give me the Air of a Coquette, and make me despicable, where I most defired to be esteemed. In short, I could not Satisfy myfelf, but that there was Something blame-able in my Condudl; and the Anxiety arifing from this Fancy was as great as could have been cauSed by any real Af-flidlion.
From this time I shunned all my Acquaintance, except Emilia^ whoSe Understanding encreafed every day in my eyes: For she indulged me in talking of Phikdes^
and
II2 LETTER IV.
and my whole Delight, when abSent from him, was in her Conversation.-
My Mother would often talk of himj but She Saw me So prepoffeffed in his fa^ vour, that her Fears for my Welfare made her endeavour a little to palliate the Violence of my Love, till I could fee by his Behaviour whether MiSery might not be the ConSequence of indulging it. But I was deaf to all Remonstrances of this kind, and every thing grew tirefome to me but the dwelling on Philoclefs Perfedlions ; nor did I once doubt my HappineSs, till he made me a Declaration of his Love, or, to Speak more- properly, till he offered himSelf to be my Hushand. Then all my Blindness could not hide the Coldnefs and Careleff-neSs of his Manner; and he left me more diffatisfied with him than I had been from the time I first had the pleafure of Seeing him. His Behaviour dwelt strongly on my Mind, and which ever way I turn^ ed it, I could not but fee that he had either naturally a calm DiSpofition not to be ruffled by the Pastion of Love, or that
I
L E T T E R IV. 113
1 was not the Objedt oS it. From this Thought started an imaginary Rivali and I racked my Self with JealouSy of I knew not \vhat. At length, worn out with Per* plexity, the Mind of itSelf turned to more pleafing Ideas, and in Philocles's Charms his Indifference and my Rival vanished; and I had no other thoughts but when I should be So happy as to See Philocles again*
This happened to me Several times, and I really think nothing this World can give, could counterbalance the Pain I Suffered in the many anxious Hours I then Spent* My Mother was continually talking to me of Philocles^ and infisted (if I was not re-folved to plunge my Self in MiSery my whole Life) on my breaking off all Commerce with him. I could not but agree with her, that my Lover’s calm and philoSophick Temper was not formed to return a Pashon Such as mine, and that it would be utterly impossible for me to be happy in his In*, difference.

I Often refletsted, that had not Shame withheld me, I could daily have found Opportunities of feeing him, which he neg-le(sted, and Seemed contented to meet with me just as it was convenient; nor did he once contrive to remove the least Obstacle to effedl it. I was too strongly convinced by what I felt mySelf, that every Trifle which has the Smallest degree of Connedion with the Objed beloved, is worked up in the Imagination of a Lover to be of the utmost ConSequence, not to See that Phi-locks could not deServe that Name.
I Often blamed mySelf for turning the most agreeable Acquaintance in the World into a diSagreeable Lover: For I imputed his thinking of me at all entirely to his reading in my very Looks, how much I liked him. But notwithstanding theSe Confiderations, and ten thouSand more, which by turns Succeeded in my Mind, Inclination was too powerful for them all; and I could not reSolve to give him up for ever. He was not to be dallied with; for
his
LETTER IV. 115
his own want of Paffion prevented his taking any delight in thoSe Trifles which, where there is great Love and TenderneSs, are always pleafing ; and his infisting on an AnSwer, reduced me to the Dilemma of either conSenting to marry him, or relign-ing him for ever. It was very eafy for me to refuSe him, whilst I thought I could See him again, and have it in my power to alter my Mind; but the very Idea that I must loSe him without any hopes of retrieval, was So horrible I could not bear it: For at that time I had no notion that it was possible for me ever to conquer my Passion.
Whenever I was with my Mother, she pressed me So earnestly not to abandon mySelf to MiSery, and was So reaSonable in her Sentiments, that I could not help agreeing with her: But the very momept I was left to mySelf, I argued So strongly in the behalf of Philocles^ that he always got the better of all my ReSolutions. I began to think, that as he was both the Objedt of Esteem and Admiration, it was more noble and generous to love him, without ex-F 2	pedting
ii6 LETTER IV.
pedling any equal return, than if he had been capable of it. I went even So far as to cherish and indulge the Thought, that violent FondneSs might perhaps he^iFrailtf and Weaknefs in Nature; and for that rea-fon the only Man who appeared to me to have every Perfedlion, was exempt from it. Emmd.^ Refolution to love Henry^ not-* withstanding all he Said to her in that most Jiery Trials made her in my eyes a perfed Heroine. I was fully perSuaded, that to make another’s Affedfion for me the Foundation of mine, must be owing to the greatest Selfilhnefs imaginable ; and I looked down with shorn on a Thought So mean.
IT is incredible, with what contempt I viewed every Woman who has no Choice of her own, but gives herSelf to the first Man who pretends he loves her. All Honour and GoodneSs was immediately cem tered by me in fetting the highest Value on Merit, without any Confideration of our-Selves; and my Fancy dressed up this Phantom of a disinterested Love in So many amiable Shapes, and Such various Charms, that I grew fond of the Image: And the
moment
LETTER IV. 117
moment I could thus make the following my own Inclinations the Road to possessing the highest Virtue, all Objedions to PhL lodes vanished; and I had found out a Method at once to indulge my Love, and gra tify my Pride.
M Y only Care was, which way I could make mySelf most amiable in the eyes of the Man, for whom my Affedion and Esteem were equal. Hitherto I had never once feen him; but I afterwards disapproved of my own Behaviour, and indeed I believe with great reaSon; for I was So confuSed from the moment he entered the Room, that it was with great difficulty I could bring myfelf to Speak; and when I had Resolution enough not to be dumb, I dare Say I uttered the greatest NonSenSe imaginable j for I knew not what I Said: And I believe it is generally the caSe, that People appear to the greatest Disadvantage, where they are most anxious to pleaSe. But whilst 1 was thus fiuduating and unreSolved how to ad, another Gentleman, to whom I will give the Name of Florio., who Saw me by chance, declared himSelf my Lover. His.
F 3^	Fortune
ii8 LETTER IV.
Fortune was So great, that it was impofiible for me to SuSpedl him of Infincerity. He was an agreeable Man, very lively in his Conversation, and had Something So inexpressibly amiable and Soft in his Manner, that I believe few Women could have re-sssted his Addresses. This at first gave me great pleaSure, as I hoped it might kindle a JealouSy in the Breast of Philocles, and warm him into a stronger Love. Florio was quite the ReverSe of the other; for his Passions were So violent, that it was equally difficult to keep him within any Bounds of Moderation; or to raiSe in Philocles one Thought which could ruffle that philo-fophick Mind of his, and make him Sen-fible of the Power of Love.
I w A s now in the oddest Situation in the World; I fighed, becaufe I could not give the Man I liked Florid.?, Warmth of Affedfion, nor take my Inclination from the only Objedt I had ever Seen capable of giving me pleafure. But the converSing with this new Lover, which I did but Seldom, had quite a contrary Effedl from what 1 expetsted. Philocles was indeed 3	jealous;
LETTER IV. 119
jealous j but it was not the JealouSy of a fond Lover, but of a reafonable Man, who being unwilling to be deceived, was re-Solved to examine every thing in the nicest manner. As I had hefitatcd Some time in giving him an AnSwer, he imagined I had only a mind to have a Variety of Lovers, and he could not bear the thoughts of dangling aster any Woman, only to pleaSe her Vanity, and be made a Fool of. He came feveral times, when unfortunately, and much against my Inclinations, I happened to be So engaged in Company, that he could not get an Opportunity of Speaking to me alone. This he construed as an Artifice of mine to avoid coming to any Explanation; and with the utmost Indifference went out of Town, without even taking leave of me.
A Man who would marry a Woman only becauSe he does not distike her, and thinks her Circumstances convenient for him, is eaSily put from the PurSuit, especially when he is not covetous; which waa Phtloclefs CaSe.
When
120 LETTER IV.
When first I knew he was gone in that abrupt manner without Speaking to me, I was almost distracted. It is impoS-fible to deScribe the many various Passions which agitated my Mind. One moment I loved, and the other hated, with the utmost Vehemence. And now that Grief was become my greatest Indulgence, I began to fancy it the greatest Virtue. The more I was mortified, the greater I imagined was my Constancy; and Constancy in Love, (whether with, or without a ReaSon) must be Something heroical. And had not Pride helped me to this Small Comfort, I verily believe the LoSs of Philoclcs would have been my Death. But from the Resolution of never liking any other Man, I fancied myfelf a Heroine; and stampt and tore my Hair with all the Dignity of a Tragedian : And I have diverted myfelf fince with the ResseCfion, that I believed at the very instant my whole Soul was filled with Anxiety, that I had the utmost Contempt for the World, and Should never care for any thing in it again,
I
letter IV, 121
I Wrote a hundred Letters to PhL locks, and burnt them all as fast; for I could not find one to pleafe me: Some were too forward, others too cold; one Minute I could condefcend to any thing, rather than he should have an ill Opinion of me ; the next I was So convinced of his Indifference, that I thought all Endeavours to bring him back would be vain; and could not bear to Subjedl myfelf to yet greater Affronts.
At first I took an utter averfion to Florio, thinking he had been the Caufe of all my Misfortunes; but by fome Accident I was prevented from feeing him for a Week j by which time my Pashon greatly fubfided; and, to own my WeakneSs, I began to be pleaSed with his Love. Whether it was that the Defpair and great Un-eafineSs which for Some time had involved my Mind, made me glad to take hold of any the least Hope of PleaSure; or, as I was disappointed of the Gratification of my real Softest Inclinations, Vanity was then most predominant in me; or whether
the
122 LETTER IV.
the Violence of Florio'% Addreffes flattered me into the most agreeable Opinion of my Self, and kept my Pride alive, I cannot determine. But this is certain, that he grew every day more and more tolerable to me j and in a Short time, (with the Exception only of fome few Sighs, that Florio could not look and Speak like PhilocleSy or Phi-locles love like Florio) I became Satisfied with the Company of the latter; with this Difference in my preSent Lover’s favour, that all that Confufion and Uneafinefs which commonly attended me, when with Phi-locleSy was now entirely vanished; and I could fit as calmly to hear Florid.^ Love, as any Statue doth before its Votaries, when blind Superstition first imagines it a Deity, and then adores it.
T H E appearance of F/(?r/Vs TenderneSs engaged my Mother totally on his fide; befides it is very natural, even for People who are fincere in their Friendship towards another, a little to forget Inclinations, when not their own^ and incline mostly to a Superiority of Fortune. In short, her Per-fuafions, his Importunities, joined to a
Hatred
letter IV. 123
Hatred I had from my Infancy of continually refilling what I was aSked, almoft prevailed on me to marry him; nor dp I believe any thing could have hindred it, but my accidentally hearing a Charadler of him, which made me reSolve to break it off. An Acquaintance of mine, on talking one day of Variety of People, happened to name Elorio as a PerSon She had known a long time. She was quite ignorant there was any Engagement between us j and I appeared defirous of knowing his real Cha-radler, laying the knowledge of it would be of great conSequenee to a Friend of mine. She replied, “ If it would be of any “ fcrvice to me, she would tell it me par-“ ticularly;” and on my earnest Request, she obliged me in the following manner.
“ You must know. Madam, Fhrio was “ once a Lover of mine; he was then the “ youngest of three Brothers, and had but “ a distant ProSped of the Estate he now “ poffeffes. However, his Love appeared “ fo fincere, and his Heart fo tender, that “ he engaged me in a Paffion I could not “ relist, and I reSglved tp marry him. Our
first
24 L E T T E R IV.
first Acquaintance came by his accidentally lodging in the Same HouSe with me. You may be Sure his becoming my Lover, did not make him change his Lodgings. Almost every Morning I was disturbed with the crying of a little Dog, which I fancied Some Children, who were in the HouSe, were pulling about, and teazing for their Diverfion, as is commonly the cafe; but one day the Dog cryed So long and fo loud, that I could not help enquiring into the Caufe of it. I met my Landlady on the Stairs, and afked her what was the meaning of all that NoiSe. She Seemed So full of mirth aud laughter, it was fome time before (he could give me an AnSwer; at last She told me, That Elorio was beating his Dog, becauSe he fancied it did not love him ; for if it did not come to him the minute he called it, he grew into the most violent Rage. But the more he beat and abuSed it, the more unwilling the Dog was to come to him : and fometimes he employed himSelf half the Morning in alternately whipping and wheedling this poor little Animal, I faid nothing to
LETTER IV. 125
my Landlady, but this made a great Impression on my Mind. I took the first Opportunity of afking Phrio about it: being not good at diSguifing his Sentiments, he owned the Truth, Saying that he never abuSed the poor Beast, but when he fancied he was So ungrateful^ as to have no Affecstion for him; and that then he Suffered ten times more torments than he could inssidt on the Dog, for that the Ressedion of having miS-
•	ufed him was Pain intolerable. I took little notice at that time j but this raiSed
■	Ideas in my Head, that I never thought on before. I began to think, if Florio
•	was capable of thus barbaroussy treating
■	any thing he fancied he loved, only from
■	a flight JealouSy that his Love was not ' returned, that then all that SoftneSs which ' appeared in his DiSpofition, could ariSe ‘ from nothing, but an overgrown Ten-' derneSs for himSelf, which he was un-' able perfedly to Satisfy ; and therefore ' he fubstituted another Objed, only to ' extend his own Enjoyments. Belides, I ' thought there must be a great Mixture ' of Pride, with an Affedion which re-
y quired
126 L E T T E R IV.
“ quired So much Flattery to gratify itj “ and was very apt to SuSped:, that any “ Woman, who had art enough to make “ him believe flie had a violent Paffion for “ him, might eafily at any time be my “ Rival. I was So fincere in my Love and “ Esteem for him, that I could not have “ avoided shewing an UneafineSs at any “ wrong Behaviour of his to any the “ meanest Creature in the world. This “ would at once have hurt his Tendernejs “ for himfef and his Pride; So that I “ should have stood but a bad chance of “ keeping him; and shat Thought ap-“ peared to me So horrid, I reSolved to “ break With him at once, and never to “ put my Self in his power.”
Here she Lady ceafed; I thanked her for telling me what she knew of Phrlp^ and then turned the Conversation on indifferent Subjeds.
When I came home, and was at liberty to rested, I was very much perplexed at what she had told me. Sometimes I fancied she might be piqued at Some Beha-
viour
L E T T E R IV. 127
viour of Floriob^, and have wronged him in her Report. However, I was reSolved to try him, and the next time he came, behaved with Somewhat more ColdneSs towards him than uSual. Had he reproached me gently for it, I should have looked on it as a proof of his Love; but he abuSed me in terms he could not have ufed, had he not been in a violent Passion. I then immediately thought of the poor little Deg, and rejoiced I was not in his power. Here my Judgment had room to play; for I had never any real Inclination for Florioy nothing more than mere Accident would have brought about the Marriage, if it had happened. I Saw plainly, that instead of that Difpofition which delights in anothers good, all his TenderneSs was for himSelf: and I can no more think the Man benevolent, who lays out his Affedlion, in hopes to encreafe his stock by a more than equal return, than I can think the MiSer generous, when he lends out hiR Money for exorbitant Interest. From, this time Florio vanished entirely from my Thoughts: I refixfed him, and he looked on me as a
JiltV
128 LETTER IV.
Jilt, becauSe I would notconSent to make my Self miserable, to indulge his Inclinations.
-I Have often wished there were Some bounds Set to what Men call Encouragement, that it might not be thought a Crime in us to defire Some little time for Consideration, before we put ourSelves entirely in a Man’s power; and that the Gentlemen would be So indulgent, as to allow us the Liberty to make a difference between drinking Tea, or fitting in company every now and then an hour with a Man, and being married to him. If this is too much Indulgence to be granted us, ^ they must proceed in calling every Woman, who is not stupid, a Coquette, and we must bear the Reproach as patiently as we can.
PHILOCLES now returned with double Force on my Thoughts. The Character I had heard of Florio, made Philocles'^ Indifference appear in an amiable Light j and I refolved, if I could be So happy as to fee my Philocles once more, never to loSe him again. But the first News I heard of
him
L fe T T E R IV. 129
him, was, that he was .married. This made me very miserable, but DeSpair Soon made me eaSy; and in a Variety of other Lovers, I at last almost lost the Remembrance of him.

TH E Account Ifabinda gives of her Love to Philocles, does not at all Surprise me, after that most amiable Cha-rader fhe drew of him ; and notwithstanding Inclination prompted her to rested with Scorn on Womens having no Choice of their own, I really think She is judicious in her Observations: For I have often thought, that the Generality of Women ad in Life, just as they do at a Ball; dreSs and adorn themfelves with the utmost Art and Care, in order to engage fome Partner to chufe them, without any farther Consideration, who, or what the Man is they dance with, than whether his Station is fuch as will give them a good Appearancej The distinguishing Tofs of the Head,

I never Saw any thing better regulated, or conducted with lest Confufion, than this whole Scene, which, I was told. Was entirely owing to a Gentleman, who G 2	for

Now, Camilla., I must inform you what d charitable Adion I did at this Ball 5 fof I reScued a poor Gentleman, who had condemned hihiSelf to Spend the whole Evening in Punishrhent, and delivered him from the burthen of his own Affectation. I had feen him often in Company; and, as I thought him good-humoured and inoffen-five, always Spoke to him when I met him
in
LETTER V. 133 in public. I obServed the whole time the Mufic played, that altho’ he kept his Seat, yet his Feet were still in motion, and he looked with an EagerneSs at the Dancers, that strongly indicated his whole Defire was to be qne oS the Number. As Men are Seldom at a loSs for Partners, I could n,ot imagine why this young Gentleman did not follow his Inclination; but when I came to fpeak to him, I foon found that he thought dancing was notanEmployment worthy of Vn Wifdom; that it was too trifling, too childish, for a Man of his XJnderJiaitding, to give into. And he made feveral Speeches entirely new, viz. That a Stranger, who had never heard of Such a Diverfion, must take a Set of People dancing to be all mad, or stung by a Tarantula, &'e\ and concluded with a fort of Triumph in his Coun? ' tenance, that he was So rational a Being, as to be above all Such ^lly nonfenftcal A-muSements. I could not forbear laughing to fee a Man Sacrificing his Pleafure to the vain Hope of gaining a Reputation of Wifdom, and throwing himSelf out of the only way of Life in which he could make a tolerable Figure (namely that of being lively G 3	and
134 LETTER V.
and gay) in order to indulge his Pride, in the Thoughts that he has a Superiority over fome of his Fellow-Creatures. However„ I took pity on him, and argued with him to prove, that he might dance without being thought at all the more foolijh; still at last my Arguments, Seconded by his Qwn Inclination, prevailed, and he performed as good a Hop^ as ever I Saw in my Life.
IC o u L D not help talking of the odd Whims of Human-kind to a very fenfible Man I met with, just after I had parted with my wife Spark. He laughed, and told me, he conld point out a perfect Contrast to him j on which he shewed me an elderly Gentleman, who was dancing very aukwardly with a Girl of Fifteen. “ Now, ■S Says he, that Man has an Understanding equal to any Undertaking; you See he V is of an Age, shat a reafonable Gravity “ would become ; and yet his only Am-bition is to be a Beau Garmon, to be thought gallant amongst the Girls, and humorous “ and witty with the gay young Men. In It short, he defpiSes being esteemed a Man

‘ of Solid good SenSe; and is full as eager to be thought a good Trifier, as the other ‘ is to gain the Reputation of a great Un-• derstandingC
Reflections on thefe two Characters took up all the Time I staid at the Ball 5 and I was obliged by an Engagement of Valetitind.s^ to Sup in a great deal of Company ; or, to Speak more properly, with a great Number of People. I never in my Life Spent So diSagreeable an Evening, where my Hushand was of t|ie Party; for NonSenSe always makes him Silent; So that I had not the pleaSure of hearing him Speak one Word the whole Evening. The Conversation was entirely taken up in this Disputation; Which is the greatest Virtue a Man can poffefs ? This Subjedl would have been very pleafing to me, if I had found real Truth or Information had been fought after by any of the Company. If Self., dear Self had been but a moment forgot, I might have hoped to have gained Some Instruction on that head from Men of Learning; but, alas! I perceived Pride was at the bottom of every Word that was ut-G 4	tered.
136 LETTER V. tered, and the only Confideration of each Individual, was to idolize every GlimpSe, every Shadow of Virtue he could, by the, greatest Fallacy, but once imagine he had a right to claim as his own; and to root out as much as ppstilile from Mens Minds the Admiration of every thing his own Vi-ciouSnefs, and want of Refolution diSabled him from attaining.

This Gentleman had run out of a good Fortune when young, and borrowed Money of his Friends to Support him in his Extravagance: but, upon the Death of a near Relation, a great Estate accidentally fell to him, when he ^ery generoujiy comr pounded his Debts; and the poor Credh tors, who had denied themSelves every thing to help him in his Distrefs, were forced to give him a Receipt in full for half their Money. So that, in reality, he owed nothing that could legally be de? manded of him.

“For my part, I look upon Honesty • to be the meanest Qimlity in the world; ' it is the Virtue of a Mechanick : And I think a Gentleman Should be all Gene-rofity, Good-Nature, and Compaflion.

This good-natured Creature has been three or four times in his Life affedted by very striking miserable Objedts, whom he relieved in reality with the Property of others. And therefore, whenever Virtue Is the Subject, he cannot help remembering and exulting in all his mighty Goodnefs^, and pleafes himfelf with the Restedtion, that he is poffested of what, in his opinion, is the only valuable DiSpofition of Mind.

Several pther Gentlemen fpoke; but, now publick and private Virtues were introduced, it was impossible to hear one Word from another. Every Man thought he was So much concerned in the Debate, that he had no patience to hear another fpeak ; and from this time I could not dh sstinguilh any thing that was Said : only the word Virtue reSounded continually in my Ears. Thus eaph Man deified that Virtue he thought would best gratify his own Pride, loudly adored the Idol of his own Imagination, and insssted that others should do the fame. And So they all together raiSed Such a Confusson, and hideous Uproar, as to me plainly proved, that real unaffedted Virtue was not in the Company; for Peace and PleaSure are her Attendants,
whilst

whilst NoiSe and DiScord are her Sworn Enemies. Thus Pride overflows the Mind of Man, as the River Nile does the Land of Egypt. Its Branches are many, its, Windings and Labyrinths numerous, its Effedls various and apparent, but its Source invisible: And, to carry on the Comparison, in Minds barren of every Virtue, Pride may Sometimes be as necessary to make Men adt right, as the Overflowing of the Nile is to fertilize the Land where no kindly refreshing Showers fall. Vermin, it is true, are bred from the Mud brought down by the Deluge; but that Inconvenience is fully compensated by the great Plenty it produces.
When I came home to amuSe mySelf after this difagreeable Scene, I read your Letter over |gain. Ifabinda is perhaps mistaken in imputing the Cruelty of Elorio to his favourite little Dog to any other CauSe, than that of real Tendernefs; and yet she was,
I think, right in discarding him, for she herSelf might have been in danger of meeting the fame Treatment.
EverV
142 L E T T E R V.
Every violent Paflion indulged to ai ExceSs, is in danger of turning into its contrary; and even TenderneSs, when turned into Rage, becomes only the Fewel to make it burn the fiercer. I would not be understood to Speak against Paifion, nor a-gainst TenderneSs, which is the most amh able of all Passions; to the highest degree of which in a Man, I owe the most ex-quifite Happinefs: but I fay there is a pof-fibility of its changing to the contraryj when in excefs, and the riSque would have been very great with a Man, who had strewn himSelf capable of this change. Indeed the gentle Refentment of the Man who is incapable of a strong Affedtion, is not half So much to be dreaded, as the fiery Wrath of him, who does but imagine he has cauSe to be offended, even in a Trifle, by the Perfon he loves. jBeSides, I think it impossible ever to be cured of a Passion for a Man So amiable as She deScribes 'Florio. And was it my cafe, altho’ the Hurricane of his violent Passion was to Sink me into Ruin, yet the moment he Was con-fcioushe had done wrong, the great MiSery
he
L E T T E R V. 143
he must unavoidably feel, would make me Suffer double in compafiion to him; and all SenSations for mySelf would be lost and Swallow’d up, in thinking what Agonies his Refledtions must give him. He would continually bring to my Remembrance the Character Dryden makes Ventidius give bf Antonji,
Virtue's his Path, but fometimes 'tis to& narrow
For his ntajt Soul; and then he Jiarts out wide.
And bounds into a Vice that bears him far From his firfl Courje, and plunges him in Ills:
But when his Danger makes him find his Fault;
^ick to obferve,and full of fiarp Remorfe, He cenfures eagerly his own Mifdeeds; fudging himfelf with malice to himfelf And not forgiving what as Man he did, Becaufe his other Parts are more than Man.
And then like Ventidius I should conclude : “ He must not thus be lost.” In a word, I should be always afraid every Indifcre-
tioB
144 L E t T fe R V.
tion which Florid.^ Pafiion cauSed, wouli be for ever hurtful to his Character. For there are a Set of cenforious Men, who never forgive the Faults of a Man of Merit: For to thoSe Faults only it is owir^, that they can indulge their Vanity in the moft delightful Thought, that mean, mercenk ry, trifing and felfijh as they are, they are not inferiour to the Man, whom, notwithstanding all they can fay to the contrary, they certainly admire, becaufe they think him worth envying. In stiorst Was I married to Florio, I stiould be in the cafe of L^antalm: his many amiable Qualities would continually make me think Hajipi-nefs within my reach; and yet the Turbulence of his Paflions would prevent ftiy really er>joying it. But, had Philocles beat the little Dog, I fancy Ifabinda would have found more excuSe for him than she could for Florio.
Bui' this Subject puts me in mind bf a Scene I was witnefs of the other day, in a married Family. They are not in very High Life, but the Hushand is an honest good fort of Man, and exceshvely fond ":
L E T T E R V. 145
his Wife. He has no fault but that of being paffionate; She has very little regard for him; is of an artful temper, and only pretends a Value for him, when it can any way Serve her own ends. I breakfasted with them, and Some few words aroSe on Some trifle, which I have now forgot: The Man flew into a Fury, Said every thing that came uppermost, without any Confi-deration what his Wife felt from the sharp nefs of his Expreshons. She bore it all very patiently, flew to Tears alone for her relief, and I really pitied her: but my Compassion was Soon turned on him ; for the moment he had time to refledt on what he had faid, he was in the greatest Agony imaginable.; and by all the Submiffions, endearing expressions, and Signs of Repentance he could invent or think of, he endeavoured to appeafe her Anger, and moderate her Grief. But now was her turn, and she was refolved not to allay his Suffering by any thing in her power. In short, in 2i foft Voice^ and without ufing one opprobrious Word, she found means of wbrk-ing the poor Man almost to Madnefs; still at last, being unable to bear her Treatment, VoL, L	H	he

he stew out oS the Houfe, and with an Oath affirmed, he would never See her more. But I was very much SurpriSed, when, instead of being frighted at his Menaces, and going after him in hopes to calm him, fhe immediately dryed up her Eyes, and burst out a-laughing. Saying;
Go thou. Fool! I know which v/ill Suffer “ most, and which will Soonest Seek the “ other.'' I could not forbear telling her, I wondered how it was possible for her to keep up any ReSentment against a Man who was So fond of her, and how she could avoid even excufing, as well as forgiving his Faults, in order to make him eaSy. Before this, fhe always expressed the greatest Esteem for me; but I Saw plainly She now conceived the greatest Contempt in the world for me. However, fhe gave me an exact Detail of her Management of her Hushand. “ Now, fays fhe, do I know, “ that this Fool will go fret and fume, and ‘‘ be upon the Rack for about half an “ Hour; then all his Resolutions will fail “ him, and, in Spite of himSelst he will “ come back to me again more fubmishve than ever: but the'more he Submits,
“ the
L E T T E R V. 147 the more stubborn I will be; nor will I ever be reconciled to him, till I have made him Suffer as much as possible; and then the Joy of Seeing me in good Humour throws him quite into my power. So far from being hurt by his Behaviour, I am glad he is So passionate; othcrwife very likely he might not be fo much my Slave. I should not be concerned, if I could provoke him to strike me; for then I should have the more to upbraid him with.”
I Stared with Astonishment at the Woman, for giving this Account of her-felf; but I have obferved, immenfe Pride and Folly when joined (and they are not inS^arable Companions) will make People take a low Cunning for Wifdom; and, rather than not prove they are possessed of what they esteem fo valuable, they will give themfelves the most diabolical Characters in the world. I ran out of the Houfe, as foon as she had finished her Speech, refolving never to fee her more. For to make uSe of a Man’s Pashons, to make him miferable, is in my eyes fo H 2	detestable
148 LETTER V.
detestable an Artifice, that I would not wisti to converse with any one capable of it.
It is now late, and I can write no more but am ever.

( 149 )
LETTER VI. Camilla to Cynthia at the Bath.
Dear Cynthia,	[Fromhondion.
IH E R E Send you the Conclufion of Ifabinda’s Story. When fhe had rested herSelf Some time, fhe proceeded as follows.
I WIL L now tell you, as well as I can recolledt, the Characters of all my other Lovers, who had any thing remarkable in them; with my Reafons for refufing them. Had I been obliged to have retired into the Country, and to lead a Solitary Life, I certainly should have languished away my Days in fighing for Philocles: for, as Love was the strongest Bent of my Nature, nothing could have cured me of the Fancy, that in him I had found the only Object worthy of it, but the great Opportunities I had of employing myfelf in endeavouring to find H 3	another
ISO L E T T E R VI.
another; and yet the first Inclination So far took place of all others, that 1 was never again poffessed of a BlindneSs powerSul enough to prevent my examining fairly and impartially the Merits of a Lover.
LEONIDAS was the first that addreffed me : He had two Sisters, by whoSe means I became acquainted with him. I narrowly obferved his Behaviour to them, thinking by that means to come at his real Character. Eanny^ the eldest Sister, was one of that fort of people, of whom you can only fay, they dejign no Harm; but She had all the Weakneffes of a filly Wo-'man; and appeared to me perfectly incapable of a strong or steady Friendship. But Jenny (the youngest) was one of the best natured Girls I ever met with; her Understanding was both lively and maScu-line, and her whole Conversation Seemed to stow from a Head capable of forming and expresting whatever Ideas she pleaSed j whilst the Softnefs of her Heart made her utterly incapable of wilfully Saying one Word to give another Pain. But what I chiesty remarked in her, was her real and
difinterested
LETTER VI. 151 difinterested Love Sor her Bother. It was impossible Sor him to have more Humours than she would comply with, or to have any Faults, which she would not endeavour to excuSe. But, notwithstanding all Jennf% good Qualities, to my great A-mazement, Fanny was his only Favourite j. and the indulging her Seemed to be his greatest Delight, whilst he entirely negletsted the other; whoSe Goodnefs was So great, that she patiently bore all the capricious Fancies of her Sister, who had not SenSe enough to meet with Such Indulgence,, without growing whimfical.
LEONIDAS appeared to me a very good-natured Man; and I was a long time greatly perplexed on account of the difference of his Behaviour to his two Sisters. But, as I made it for fome time the Subject of my daily Thoughts, I believe I at last found out the Caufe of it. Altho*^ Leonidas had fometimes the Appearance of Affedfion, yet in reality' he had none, but what conduced to the Satisfadtion of his Vanity. Now Fanny's Follies and Weaknesses flattered him into a Belief, that it was H 4	generous
153 LETTER VI.
generous in him to Sorgive them; and, as he found a Secret PleaSure in humouring and obliging her, without examining over-nicely into the reaSon, he eafily perSuaded himSelf that it was Love; whilst poor Jenny's Behaviour to him was So exadl and faultleSs, that he confidered any Returns he could make her, only as a Debt he was obliged to pay. So that he looked on her as he would on a Dun, whom, when he had paid to the uttermost Farthing, he could not Jirut, and Say, I have done more than ^ujiice. Thus Fanny's Faults gave him the PleaSure of fecretly magnifying his own GoodneSs, whilst Jenny's Virtues Seemed to stand in competition with his, and in reality rather hurt than pleaSed him. When Fanny was out of humour for nothing, he could eafily Submit and beg her pardon, becaufe this was a plain CondeScenfion on his part; but if Jenny's Heart was breaking at any Unkindnefs of his, and she did but look concerned, he found his own Vd.ik hurt, in her daring to think he could behave ill; and immediately imputed herUn-eafinefs fo. fome wrong Caufe; construed her Tendernefs into Obstinacy; could eaSily
conquer
L E T T E R VI. 153
conquer what he never Selt; and be merry whilst She was full of Grief; and then rejoiced that he was the be ft humoured Man alive, and thanked his Stars, that he was born free from all fetch foolijh Pride. Thu.^ he carried about him a Racket, which he managed So artfully, that, when he Saw the Tennis-ball coming towards him, he could always ward the Blow, and strike it from himSelf. The more the poor Girl studied to plcaSe him, the lower She threw herSelf in his Opinion, and only encreafed his Notion of his own Grandeur ; which made him imagine she could not give him half So much as his due : Nay, he went even So far, as to flatter himfelf how well he could manage, and make others Submit to him; becauSe the only PerSon who had a strong Inclination to oblige him, had not Resolution enough to get the better of it. Befides, as Fanny confidered nothing but the gratifying her own Whims, and had always Some nonSenfical Point of her own to make him conSent to, she never offered to contradict him in any thing that would hurt him ; whereas Jenny, who had no o-ther Confideration but his real Interest and
Honour,
IS4- LETTER VI.
Honour, could not help shewing a Distike of whatever tended in she most distant ^iew to his Disadvantage. But the moment that I was convinced, that Art instead of Love was necestary to keep up his Affection, I was determined never to have miy thing to fay to him: For, it being my strongest Inclination to uSe my utmost En-ideavours to pleafe any PerSon for whom I have the least degree of Love; I found ■wish him I must be miferable.
My next Lover, whofe Name was Woud’^all, was very ridiculous, from not having Understanding enough to conceal Jbis Character, even in the fmallest degree. *Tis true, great part of Mankind feel the fame shing; but then, either Cunning or Good-breeding prevails on them to hide it. In short, he was the greatest Humourist, and she most Selfish Creature in the World. His Education had been too low, to enable him by custom to conquer his Nature; So that it broke out on every trifling occa-fion; even So far, as to shew all his Companions, that nothing but Self was worth his notice; and that he looked on them,
only
LETTER VI. 155 only as a Set of Creatures made for his Diverfion. I have been told by Gentlemen of his Acquaintance, that when he went to a Tavern, he would always run the first into the Room, in order to get the most convenient place at the Fire; and that he would Seize the Pipes the moment they were brought, that, if there was any difference, he might chufe the best; and Sometimes he was a good while in deliberating which to take ; for, if afterwards he had any Sufpicion, that another had one the least degree beyond his in GoodneSs, he was lb uneafy, he could not fmoak in peace. And, as there is but little Ceremony obferved amongst Men^ he was Sure to help himfelf first at Dinner, that he might Secure whatever was most to his Taste; nay, I have mySelf Seen him, when he has been at Table with Women, look with as much Perturbation and Anxiety, whilst the Lady of the Houfe has been helping them, for fear he should lofe Some nice Bit, on which he had fixed his Eyes and Heart, as if his whole Welfare had depended on it. But, as there is nothing Mankind fo hardly forgive, as being treated with Contempt ;
156 LETTER VI.
tempt; and he was So very open and unreserved in the Preference he gave himfelf-, every one, who would keep him Company, found out fome method of teazing him, by disappointing his Schemes; and where-ever he went, it was a general Plot to debar him of every thing he liked; still he was at last reduced, either to fit by him-Self, or live continually on the Fret, by ob-ferving, that all People, instead of wishing he might be pleafed, took a delight in tormenting him.
ICoNFESs, I thought it but Justice, that the Man who had no Confideration for any thing in the World but his own dear Self, fhould lofe the Benefits that ariSe from Society, and meet with no-body, that has any regard for him. You may be well assured this Gentleman never gave me a Serious Thought; and I mention him only, becauSe I think his Charadler Something peculiar, in thus openly shewing his SelfishneSs,
The next that declared himSelf my Lover, was Damas, As far as I could penetrate,
LETTER VI. 157
trate, and by what I heard of him from all forts of People, he behaved So justly, and with Such an exadt Honesty to all Mankind, that he gained my Esteem, altho’ he could not raiSe my Taste; So that I uSed to bewail the CapriciouSneSs of the human Mind 5 that we are neither able to fix our Love, where we think it would be justly placed, nor remove it from the Objedt that pof-festes it, without any other motive, but that of a refistleSs Attradfion, which we can neither leffen or encreafe by our Rea-fon. I never could find the least Fault in Damas's Condudl, and was greatly pleaSed with his Acquaintance, altho’ I could not think of him as a Hushand. It was not possible for me to dive into his Principles j for he was very referved in declaring his Sentiments on any but frivolous Subjedts. But an old Gentleman (whoSe Acquaintance I looked on as one of the greatest Blessings of my Life, as he gave me the PleaSure of his Converfation, without declaring himSelf my Lover, loved me with a fatherly Affedlion, and esteemed me enough to take delight in improving my Knowledge) afked me one day, what I
thought
158 LETTER VI,
thought of Damns. I laid in his Praifc every thing I could think on; and concluded, with lamenting to my Friend, that it was not in my power to have any Inclination for the only Man I had ever met with, whom otherwiSe I thought I should be happy with as a Hushand. The Gentleman Smiled, and Said, he fancied, if I knew Damns's real Charadler, I Should not So much regret my want of liking him; for that, notwithstanding the JustneSs of his Behaviour, there was nothing So very amiable at the bottom, as I imagined. J earnestly defired him to explain himSelf; and in compliance with my Request, he thus began :
“ I Should never have been So well ■ acquainted with Damns'^ Principles, had “ I not known him when he was very young, the time when most People Speak their Thoughts freely, and without Referve. When he was but Twenty, he was as much Settled in his Notions, as most Men are at Forty^ He is a perfedt Sceptic in Religion; he neither believes or dishelieves any thing, but
“ leaves
LETTER VI. 159
leaves it at large,. and argues thus : I will adt in the Same manner, as if I had the strongest Faith of any Man; then, if there should be another World, and good x^dtions are to be rewarded, I shall Secure my HappineSs there. But this Notion he keeps to himSelf; for he would have others firm Believers, as he thinks he may be Some way the better for it in them Behaviour to him. He is stridlly honest; for he looks on Honesty as the best Policy; and never receives an Obligation he can poshbly avoid, bc-caufe he knows most People are apt to think they are not fully repaid, and become Enemies the moment they take it into their heads, that a Man is ungrateful to them. And it is a Maxim of his, to let no Man hate him; becaufe no Station or Circumstances can throw People So low, but they one time or other may have it in their power to do miSchief. He is guilty of no Vice; for his Pafiions are naturally So moderate, that they never get the better of his Judgment; and he has Such a Command of himSelf, that he
« weigh
[6o L E T T E R VL ‘ weighs in an exadt Balance, whether ‘ the ConSequence of any Action will be ‘ more PleaSure or Pain; and constantly ‘ gives the preference to what will bring ‘ him most of the former. He is not a-‘ varicious ; and has no Idea of wishing for ‘ more Money than he can Spend : but yet ‘ he does not give to others, what he can ‘ very well Spare; becauSe he has no mo-‘ tive to it; for he laughs inwardly at the ‘ word Benenjolence., and thinks there’s ‘ no Such thing: But he encourages the ‘ Belief of it in others; becaufe he does not ‘ think it impoffible, but their believing ‘ it a Virtue, may, by Some unforeSeen ‘ Accident, redound to his own Good. ‘ You well know he is all ComplaiSance, ‘ and shews a great WillingneSs to oblige ‘ whomever he converfes with.

He is as free from Malignity, as ‘ from Good-nature, and would receive
‘S no
LETTER VI. i6t
no more pleaSure in doing hurt that! good; Sor I never Saw any figns of Envy, in him: if he has any fpark of ' it, he gets the better of it, from finding At an uneafy restleSs Passion. In short-he lives in the World, without either loving or hating any thing that Surrounds him, and has no other confideration in his Commerce with Mankind, but which way he shall make it conducive to his oWn Happinefs. He is a real Epicure in the most minute things in Life, and will put away his Snuff-box or Tobacco for fo many hours, only to heighten the ' PleaSure of taking to it again. He never fitfe down to Table, but wheh he is hungry; and always avoids drinking to excefs, becauSe he knows that Temperance gives the greatest Relish to Wine^
“He would marry you, not becauSe 1-ie has any particular Affedtion for you>
' but becauSe he has a mind to have a Wife, and Chance threw you in his way; He likes you very well as a Woman, and thinks your Circumstances will mak^ you a Match fpr him, which the World Vo L. I.	I	“ wi
162 L E T T £ R VI.
“ will not blame. You think, perhaps, he has a great deal of TenderneSs for youj “ but I can assure you, it is quite a miS-“ take; for he looks on making love as “ a Trade; and the Coolnefs of his own “ Passions enables him to fee clearly into the bent of thoSe of others; and he can “ effedtas much of any thing, as he thinks necessary to bring about any Purpofe he has a mind to attain. And now, “ that I have told you what is really true, (ytZi that whatever appearance “ Damas may make of GoodneSs, he is “ the most Selfissi Creature in the world;) “ perhaps you may not So much regret your want of Taste for him as you did before.”
I Thanked the Gentleman for his Information; and was as well pleafed to find I had no reaSon to esteem the Man I could not like, as I should have been Some time before at a diScovery of any new Perfedlion in the Man I could not help liking. Damas was my last Lover, that had any thing peculiar in his Charadler; the rest Wire amongst the common Herd,
People
letter Vi. 163
People I could not bear to hear twice mention the Word Love I So that for Some time I had a Cessation of all thoughts of being married. I had refuSed fo many Offers, that I w^as looked on as a Coquette; and it was reported, that I had made a Resolution against Matrimony.
During this Interval, I lost my Mother. This was a Serious Afflicstion to me, and gave my Thoughts So grave and philosophical a turn, that 1 began now iii earnest to have that Contempt for the World, I uSed to imagine I was mistreSs of, eveil when \ could not bear the most trifling Disappointment. All Company grew irk-Some to me, and I retired into the Country, where Books were the only Companions I delighted in.
Perhaps it may Sound very improbable, that a Woman at the Age of Twenty-five, and in possession of a Fortune capable of making an Eclat in the World, Should chuSe to lead the Life of an Hermit; yet it really became pleafing to me j and I vas almost ready firmly to reSolve, no-I 2	thing
164 L E T T E R Vl.
thing Sliould ever allure me Srom that Scend of QuietneSs and Serenity, to launch into that Sea, orof Troubles, the World, again.
In this manner, I continued to live for two Years, when a Gentleman, whoSe PerSon I had Some faint Remembrance oS^ (he having been my Neighbour when he was a Boy) came and Settled in a little Houfe, at a Small distance from me. The Account I heard of his Spending his time much in the Same Taste, in which I choSe to paSs my own, gave me a CurioSityto fee him. This was no difficult Talk to bring about; for I never stept out of my Houfe to walk in the Fields, but I was Sure to meet him in my way. In short, we became intimate almost infenfibly ; and without any Declaration of Love, he took Such pains to oblige, and shew me the most particular Complaifance,* that I looked on mySelf under an Obligation to him for his Friendship, before I had the least Suspicion of his real Intentions. We read, walked, and converSed with each other with the greatest Freedom; and his
Sentiments
L E T T E R VI. 165
Sentiments corresponded So exadly with my own, that, whenever he Spoke, he declared my very Thoughts: So that I grew Srom one degree of Affedlion for him to another, till he gained my whole Esteem ; and his Company was always the most agreeable AmuSement I could have. In a word, he at last professed himSelf my Lover, telling me he had been So, from the time he first faw me, when I was but a Girl, and he a Boy 3 but that he could not bear the thoughts of even the Appearance of wishing to make a Prey of my Fortune; and therefore, as he was fenfible of the great Inequality there was between us on that account, he was reSolved to abfent himSelf for ever from me, unleSs he could by any means raife himfelf enough in the World, to make it probable, that he really liked me without any interested Views ; that he had put himfelf into the Sea-fervice, where by the help of Some good Acquaintance> and his willingly expofing himfelf to any Hardships that his Duty made him liable to, he at last got the Command of a ssnall Shi]^; and there being a War, he had taken a Prize, which had put him in a Situation I 3	that
i66 LETTER V|.
that he hoped would clear him in my Q-pinion of having any merpenary Defigns on pie.
I Was at first a little startled at this Declaration; for fince my Retirement, I enjoyed So much Satisfadtion from the Tranquillity of rny own Mind, that I did not care to give way to any Passion that might ruffle and difeompofe my Thoughts. But my continual Conversation with my Hushand (for fo this Gentleman is now) gave me daily Proofs of both his Honour ^nd Love, and let me have the pleaSure pf thinking I could not be too grateful to the Man, whoSe Affection for me was fo fincerpi In a word, I at last gave him my Hapd and Heart. It is impossible for any Woman to be happier than I have been ever fince. My Lover is capable of all the Refinements in his Passion, that any rea^ fonablc Woman can wish ; and my Love for him is founded on So strong an Esteem, that in my utmost care to oblige him, I at once conSult my HappineSs, and perform my Duty.

LETTER VII. Cynthia to Camilla at London.
Dear Cam ill A,	[From the Btlth,
I Am not at all Surprised at the Character of I^eonidas, nor at his making his Sister Fanny his Favourite. ThoSe Smiles and that Good-humour which cost us dear, generally become the more valuable, as we are apt to triumph in the Enjoyment of what is not common, and to prize whatever we think we have ourSelvcs been instrumental in procuring, beyond that which flows froni the natural DiSpofition of others. Bestdes, Men often from what they read and hear^ and fometimes, I am afraid, from what they See, join the Idea of Women, and being troublefome. So ffrongly together, that thofe of them, who have SenSe enough to avoid all Impertinence, are often treated with Difrepect and Contempt;
becaufe
letter vir. 169
becauSe it is even forgot that they are Women. As I have Seen a Parrot, who uSed to chatter and disturb the Company the whole time of Dinner, taken much notice of for fo doing; but when from any accident he has been filent, he lost his Food for want of being remembred.
Perhaps a Man of SenSe would be yery apt to laugh at the Folly of a Lady J know, who, being married greatly beyond her Expectation (tho’ not at all beyond what in her own opinion she deServes) often fends away Tradeswomen with their Goods unSold, for no other reaSon, than becaufe they are not costly enough; For she looks upon it, as not enjoying her Fortune, if she buys any thing that she thinks can be attainable by thofe Vulgar Wretches^ who happen not to be So rich as herfelf. By this means she gives double the worth of every thing she wears, and struts with a vifible Pleafure in her Countenance, when she has just proved she has more Money to throw away, than her for-pier Acquaintance. . And yet this very Man of §etife can lay out all his GoodneSs, and
expend
170 L E T T E R VII,
expend all his ComplaiSance, to obtain a worthless Smile for no other reaSon^ but becauSe it costs him dear; whilst he neglects the Soft, the engaging tender Care that another takes to pleaSe himj and this only, becauSe he cannot think any thing valuable, which is So eafily obtained. Befides, there must always be a wide difference between that Esteem which is extorted by a good Behaviour, and that Love which ariSes from the natural Bent of a Man's own Inclinations. He will always view the most trifling Faults of the former with a magnifying Glafs, whilst thoSe of the latter, like his own, are lestened, and fade into nothing by the strength of his own Imagination.
As to the Characters of WouLall and Damas, I look on them to be very like each other ; the only diflPerence I can fee between them, is, that Damas, being Sen-stble of the Deformity of his FeaturcSj wifely chuSes to wear a Mafk, whilst Woud^alIs want of Understanding takes from him the power of Reflection, and
makes
LETTER VII. 171
makes him expoSe his own UglineSs barefaced to every Beholder.
I Am very glad Ifabindd.s Story ends in her being well married; for I was very much afraid, after having been So very deliberate in her Choice, that when flie came to live a retired Life, the having perhaps but one Lover, might make her fix on him, altho* he had not Been So worthy as many She had refuSed. For, whatever is fhe most predominant Passion of the Mind, is apt to prevail oyer our SenSes, So far as m make us eafily believe, we have found an Objecst to gratify it. And we feel Such a Happinefs in thus impofing on ourSelves, as makes it hard for us to endeavour to iind out the Truth.
IF Mankind were all fairly to examine themSelves, I question much, whether they would think Don ^ixote's fancying a Country Girl to be a great PrinceSs, and infisting, that She was stringing Pearl, instead of winnowing Corn, was So extraordinary an Effedl pf the human Imagination, as it appears at first fight.
But
172 letter VII.
But I dined yesterday, where I Saw ^ Scene of real Solid PleaSure, which wanted no Fallacy to Support it; and where, the more nicely I examined, the more I was convinced, that the ChearfulneSs there arofe from confcious Goodnefs, and the Goodbreeding from an unaffected Delire of plea-fing others. When we arrived at the Houfe, which stands at a fmall distance from hence, I was delighted to fee a Building, where Expence does not appear to have been Spared, and where there is full Magnificence, and Grandeur enough to {hew the Taste of the Builder j whilst every Part Seems fo calculated for USe, that it is viSible the Owner intends to live, and let others, alSo live in it; and that he does not make it his Sole Defign to keep it as a Show for Strangers to gaze at, as fpme do, only tc) gratify a fruitlefs Vanity. I co;ifeSs tp you I am apt to imagine, wherever a great Superiority of Fortune is very apparent, that I Shall be treated with a formal Ceremony, and made to feel a Restraint, which takes away the pleafurc of all Conversation. But how was I Surprized ! when the Lady
of
LETTER VII. 1^3
bf this HouSe received me with a good-natured Freedom, that plainly proved fhe was innocent of even a Thought that might offend another, and never harboured a Suspicion, that any one could have an Intention of dropping a word, that might tend in the most distant view to hurt her. Her whole care Seemed to be, that All her Hushand’s Friends (for there were Several Gentlemen there) Should be treated as he himSelf could wish, without following the Fashion of Some few Ladies, who make a great Distindlion between their own Friends, and thoSe of their Hushands: And the Gentleman Seemed to enjoy his Fortune, only as it gave him an Opportunity of Serving his Acquaintance, and being beneficent to Mankind. The whole Company were pleaSed j and no Sooner did any one give the least hirst of what would be most agreeable, but the Master and MistreSs of the Family made it their own Defire to have it complied with. The Joy and Serenity that reigned in their Countenances, was diffuSed throughout the HouSe j and their most menial Servants appeared to ob-Serve thdr Commands, as thofe of sheir
generous
174 letter vii
generous BeneSactors, instead of fhewing that Fear and UneafineSs, which attend the notion of its being difficult to pleafe even with the utmost Endeavours.
i W A s So delighted with this Scene^ that at my return home, I could talk of nothing elSe to Valentine the whole Evening. He told me, that he had heard the Character of this Cxentleman from one who was very intimate with him, who Said, “ That his Principles of Religion were So “ strongly fix’d, and his Adoration of his “ Creator So great, thatj had he no Bene-“ volence, he would act rightly, and do “ good; but that his whole Mind over-flowed with Benevolence and Good-“ nature to Such a degree, as would induce “ him to do all the good in his power^ even if he had no Religion ; that he “ conferred Obligations, as if he was re-“ ceiving them. That his Pleafure was “ always the greatest, and nothing could ‘‘ equal his Joy, when he was relieving “ another; and that he was So happy in “ the Choice he had made of a Wife* ^ that She always promoted his good In-
LETTER VII. 17s
tentions, instead of endeavouring to stifle them/’
This Account, and the Image of this iamiable Family, dwelt So strongly on my Mind, that I waked this Morning, plea* fing mySelf with refleding on what I Saw and heard yesterday 3 and went to the Pump-Room, in the most chearful Spirits imaginable. But I dined to-day where there was a perfed Contrast to the agreeable Scene I have been deScribing, and where the whole Company Seemed to be taking pains to make one another unhappy. They are come to the Bath for the Season, have the Command of a plentiful Fortune; and I know of nothing but their own perverfe Tempers to obstrud their HappineSs: For every one affeds to confine all the Senfes to herfelf, and will not allow her Companions even to hear or See but in the . fame manner and degree, as she herSelf does. Perhaps at first you will not clearly apprehend what I mean 3 tho’ I have Seen the fame thing, in a lefs degree, in Several places; but here they all topped their reSpediye parts.
There
476 LETTER Vli
There are four young Ladies, the eldest not above Twenty-five, they live with an old Aunt of about Sixty, who accompanies them wherever they go, to take care of them. One has weak Eyes, that is, stie fees best where there is not a glaring Light; and therefore begs the Room may be darkened on one fide; on which the rest, in a fort of triumph, throw open all the Window-Shutters, and burst into a loud Laughter at what they call her AffeBa-tion. Another is fubjed to violent Pains in her Head, and consequently all NoiSe is offenfive to her; for which reafon they Surround her, and hollow in her EarS; thinking it a good Jest, to cure her of being Such a delicate fine Lady. The Third is afflicted with a Flufhing in her Face, and begs She may not fit oppoSite the Fire; and therefore the others always catch the Corners (and more efpecially in very cold Weather) venting great Witti-ciSms on her Care of her Complexion. The Fourth, who I think is the least filly, is always plagued with the other three* becauSe she does not appear to have quite
I	ib
LETTER VIL 177
So much relish as they have for their Jokes on one another. And the old Woman helps to teaze every one in her turn; for, as her whole Life has been one continual Scene of affecsting to avoid Affectation, she thinks every one is guilty of it but herfelf, and is willing to cure her Nieces of all their Follies. In short, instead of endeavouring to amuSe and divert themSelves, they are in eternal DiSputes, how much Light muff be agreeable to all Eyes; what Degree of Sound is moff pleafing to all Ears, &c. Setting bounds to the SenSations of others by their own. And trifling as this may appear, it is the Source of half the DiSagreeableneSs that one meets with in all Companies, where Familiarity ex-cuSes Ceremony; for then Nature uncurbed, appears in her true colours, and SelfishneSs cannot be hid : An arbitrary determination of the SenSations of others being the ffrongeff proof of the utmost Care-ieffneSs and Indifference, whether they enjoy PleaSure, or Suffer Pain.
People are ashamed to confeSs they feel no UneaSmeSs from the Sufferings of VoL. I.	K	thoSe,
178 LETTER VIL
thoSe, whom they honour with the Name of Friends; and therefore the more effectually to conceal their own Ill-nature, they will not give thofe Friends leave to judge even of what they feel. When this Difpofition happens in a Woman, who has any Superiority over her Companions, they must be all miferable. For want of Liberty in Trifles, is more vexatious, than when our Actions are controuled only in things of Confequence^ which can beful us but Seldom throughout our Lives.
I Know one young Lady, who deals extremely well with this fort of people. Her Father and Mother would teaze out the very Heart of any other Perfon; but She contrives to manage in fiich a way, that stie always shews them, how much they are in the WTong, and at the fame time pays them the most exadl Obedience and Deference imaginable: For, whenever they won’t allow her to know what she likes, and infist upon it, that she must fee, hear, and feel just as they pleaSe ; she replies; That, altho’ she cannot help her Frailties, yet she knows her Duty too well, to dispute
LETTER VII. 179
pute their Commands; and, whenever they think proper to let her know their Will and PleaSure, She will make it her BufineSs to obey them. This they don’t like; for they would have her contradidt her own SenSes, and always do what is dipleafing to her; and yet must it not appear that they command her arbitrarily, or govern her with Tyranny.
People, who are capable of being unreasonable in their ConverSe with others, are not Satisfied with their Compliance and Submiffion. No, their Minds alSo must be instaved, and apparently applaud that very Ufage by which they Suffer. They would have you wear their Chains, but modejily expedt you should not feel the Weight of them. A fond Mother, who whips her Child till it Smarts, and then whips it again, becauSe it dares to cry at any Fa^ vQur that comes from her hands, is no ill Pidlure of the Candour and Good-nature^ with which a little Power often invests the human Species. But this Subjedl is always difagreeable to me; becauSe I have Seen So many Examples of real Cruelty, under the K 2	pretence
i8o LETTER VII.
pretence of redifying others Faults; and met with So many People, who are So very generous in this Instance only, that forgetting themSclves, and negleding their own Imperfections, they make it their whole study to render their Friends, their dear Friends perfect; and bemoan their Frailties fo very . much, that like all real Griefs, they feem to be always uppermost in their Thoughts.
I W E N T the other day to vifit the Lady I mentioned to you in a former Letter, who Was fo kind to show me thoSe pretty Verfes fire received from her Acquaintance, and with whom I am lately become very intimate. I there met another Lady, whom I thought very agreeable, and who entertained me very well during the time of her stay, which was not above half an Hour. When she was gone, I ashed my Friend who she was, and expreffed a liking to her Conversation. She Smiled, and replied, that indeed she did not wonder at my Approbation of Biddy^s Wit, for she had exhausted great part of her Stock, to recommend herSelf to me as a Stranger: “ But, continued she,
“ take
LETTER VII. i8i
take care how you let her creep into an Acquaintance with you; for you ne-“ ver can get rid of her again, without “ being rude to her. I have known her “ and her whole Family a great many “ Years, So that I cannot bring mySelf “ now to fhun her wkh any Incivility. “ But Slie has Something very odd in her “ Charadfer; and, if you have a mind to “ hear it, I will tell it you.” I immediately anSwered, 1 had a great Curiofity to hear it; on which my Friend obligingly began as follows.
“You must know, Cynthia., that Biddy has nothing of her own, but is made up of Patch-work, and compoSed of Shreds, which she has picked up from others. But borrowed Wit, like borrowed Money, is genially fquandered away in a lavish manner, as People do not think it worth their while to be tenacious of what is not properly their own. When Biddy was young, she was very handSorne, as you may eafily perceive ; and, altho’ her Fortune was but Small, yet her Beauty gained her many K 3	“ Lovers.
i82 letter VII.
“ Lovers. But what is very Singular in her caSe, is, that she never refuSed one, “ and yet is to this day unmarried; Sor she liked every Man who made his Ad-dreffes to her, and yet in reality liked “ none particularly. Her Mind was too “ full of Levity to be fixed, and too vain “ not to be pleaSed with every PerSoHj “ who thought it worth his while to put her in mind, that she was the Objed “ of Admiration. She looked on her ‘‘ Lovers but as fo many Looking-Glasses, which were to keep up her Good-‘‘ humour, by letting her view her own Charms in the fairest light. The Gay, “ the Serious, the Young, the Old, the “ Handfome, and the Ugly were all equally Promoters of her Pleafures; and con-“ fequently she was equally fond of them “ all. If she made any difference, it was ‘‘ to the prejudice of the most defervingj “ becaufe, as she had a mind to engroSs all ‘‘ AgreeableneSs and Merit to herfelf, she fometimes looked with Envy on even her “ Lovers, and was afraid they might rival ‘‘ her in fome Perfection, (which I be-“ lieve, is the only reaSon to be found out
“ Sor
letter VII.
for the choice Some Women make.) But as to Biddy, all the Men of SenSe were Soon diSgusted with her Levity, and consequently left her; and, as to thoSe Coxcombs, whoSe ultimate End in following a handfome Woman, is the Satisfadlion of their own Vanity, by shewing the world she likes them ; her immediately appearing fond of them, foon made them tired of the Purfuit, as having attained their only View. Whilst her Youth lasted, and a Succef-fion of Lovers followed each other, it was indifferent to her who it was that admired her, provided she was admired ; she pasted her time with great Gaiety: but now, that she can no more be foL lowed and addressed, her only fleafure is, to get new Acquaintance to hearken to her Story, and to let them know of what Confequence Jhe has been. Amongst the Injudicious she is reckoned a Woman of great Understanding; for, at her first feeing them, she is very eager to vent what good Observations she formerly picked up amongst Men ofSenfe; and, as she is always ready to open her K 4	“ Mouth
184 LETTER VII.
Mouth to Speak, or to laugh, they aS-terwards take it for granted, that what she Says is entertaining. She is called “ Mifs Biddy every where; becauSe she ‘‘ will not give up her Pretenfions to Youth, “ nor part with her great Defire oS making “ Conquests.”
I Thanked the Lady for the Account she had given rpe of Mifs Biddy-j and, as it was late, took my leave of her, as I must now do of

fery
i86 LETTER VIII.
Sery in converfing with Mankind; and, notwithstanding the many Disappointments I formerly met with in Search of Good-nefs, yet am I fully rewarded in having found it at last ; and that too in Such a degree, as, if I was to be locked up from hearing of others Misfortunes, would make me happy to my utmost Wish.
I W1L L relate to you a Story I heard a few days ago. A young Woman, whole Defires to do good are unbounded, altho’ her Power is very much confined, happened to be feized with a violent Fit of the Tooth-ach. Her Friends prevailed on her to content to have it drawn, and they accordingly tent for a Man to perform the Operation, whom they had known Some little time; but as he was not preSently to be found, they were for fending for Somebody elSe to relieve the poor Creature out of her Pain, which every moment encreafed; but she infisted on it she would stay till he could be met with; and reSolutely bore the raging Agonies of the Extremity of the Tooth-ach two Hours, for no other ReaSon, but becauSe she knew this Man was fo miSerably
poor,
LETTER VIII. 187
poor, that the Money She was to give on that Occafion must be of real Service to him, And relieve him as much in one way, as he did her in another. This was Good-Nature to Such a degree, that the very Repetition of it brought Tears of Joy into my Eyes; but I could not help fighing, when it was added, that her Delight in doing good could hardly ever be attended with any other SenSation than that of Grief at her own Inability to put it in pra<5lice ; for that the unhappy Situation of her Circumstances was the Reafon fhe could not relieve this poor Man, and yet employ another.
I Am lately fallen into an Acquaintance with Delus, a Gentleman, the History pf whofe Life, (which I had from a third PerSon) gave me great pleaSure, and is as follows:
“ DELUS was born of a Gentleman’s Family, and his Father had a good Estate; but his Mother being extravagant, and both of them bad Managers, they contrived to run it out, and brought
y every
i88 LETTER VIII.
“ every thing to conSufion by the time the ‘‘ Sons (for they had more Children) were “ grown up. Delus was hated and ill-“ treated by his Mother from the time he “ was born. His elder Brother was the “ Favourite, but Delus was looked on as “ unworthy her Regard; and to my Sor-“ row I am told it is no uncommon CaSe “ for Women (which very Name gives “ me an Idea of the utmost TenderneSs) “ even to take Averfions to Some of their “ own Children, whilst they are madly “ fond of the others. But to proceed in my “ Story; Delus was left Some little For-“ tune by a Relation, which his Mother “ by her Artifices caufed to be laid out for “ his Brother’s advantage, although he “ was still unprovided for. But/^AlJSage “ could not root from the generous young “ Man’s Mind his fixed Principle of filial “ Duty, and stridl Regard for his Parent’s “ Welfare. When he lost his Father, he “ undertook to fettle his confuSed Affairs; “ Supported his Mother without once “ thinking of her former Behaviour to “ him, borrowed Money to buy himSelf a “ Post, in order to be able to continue to
“ Support
LETTER VIII. 189
Support her; and without any Selfish “ Regard what Hardships he went thro’, “ to bring about his only PurpoSe of being
at once just to his Creditors, and good “ to his Sole remaining Parent, lived in “ Such a manner as to accomplish his wor-“ thy and noble Defigns.” Such Instances oS GoodneSs make me exult and rejoice in being oS the Same Species; and, to my great happineSs, Delus is rewarded in having Succeeded So far, that he is now per-Sedly eaSy in his Circumstances, whilst he has the continual pleafing Reflection of a Life So Spent; and I cannot help thinking it a Bleffing to Sec and converfe with Such a Man. But I have been provoked two or three times by People to whom I have told this Story, (as I am fond of telling it) who either Seem dubious in the Belief of it, or elSe by far-fetched Fallacies endeavour to find out Some other Motive than real GoodneSs, for even Such Actions as theSe. This must ariSe from Such a Malignity, that I almost tremble to fee the People who are poffefTed of it.
Now
190 LETTER VIII.
Now, Cynthia., I have related to you every thing I have heard, except what is uttered by my Father and Camilla, that has given me pleaSure ever fince I Saw you. I know you partake of all the SenSations of your Friends; and therefore heartily wish I could communicate to you more Scenes of Joy, more Stories of Generofity and Good-Natiire. But I must here lay down my Pen; or, if I repeat what other remarkable Scenes I have obServed, as I guefs your Heart by my own, you will be Sony to hear frefh Proofs how Mankind make each other and themfelves miserable, by that SelfifhneSs, which makes them overlook how much their HappineSs depends on, and is Supported by each other.
I M E T two young Gentlemen viSiting a Friend of mine the other day, whom I heartily pitied. They were in ragged and threadbare Mourning; and their whole Appearance was that of an Endeavour to conceal their Poverty, whilst by that means they doubled its Burthen. I afked my Friend as Soon as they were gone, who they 3	were,
LETTER VIII. 191
Were, and what were their Circumstances. He informed me, they were bred up with the hopes of being Heirs to an old rich Uncle, who is lately dead, and who had barbaroufly cut off all their Hopes, and baulked thofe Expectations which from his own Behaviour were highly reasonable. I pitied the poor young Men, and told my Friend, I should be glad if any Method could be found out to put them into Some Employment, which might preserve them from being drove into Wicked-neSs by the Force of Neceshty. But when I came to enquire more narrowly into this Affair, how was I shocked when I heard the true ReaSon of their Uncle’s difin-heriting them! It Seems they had been bred up with him from their Infancy, in which helpleSs State they lost both their own Parents ; but no GoodneSs of his could ever engage them to the least Gratitude, or affeCl them with the Smallest degree of Love ; on the contrary, the moment they were capable of Reflection, they Spent their whole time in laying low Plots, and venting mean InveCtives against one another to their Uncle ; each hoping by that
192 LETTER VIII.
means to graSp all his Wealth. The old Gentleman, whoSe Understanding was strong and vigorous, notwithstanding his Years, Saw through their mercenary baSe Defigns, and equally disappointed them both; for he left all he was worth to a young Man, whom he choSe for his Heir from the Recommendation of the Merit of having laboured to fupport a finking Family; and who, I am told, intends to give Bread out of it to thefe two unnatural Brothers, after he has let them fuffer long enough to be convinced at once of their Folly and their Grime. They are the highest Friends now in their Distrefs, and feem concern’d for thus caufelestly having been each other’s Enemies. And I hope this bad ConSe-quence of their Perfidy will teach them for the future to endeavour to assist, instead of pulling down each other. Such things as thefe would make me weary of Ifife, if I was not comforted at home, for all I can fee and hear abroad.
My Father, my dear Camilla^ and I, Spent the last Week at a little distance from Town 3 becaufe I was told the Change
of
LETTER VIIL tgj
of Air would be of Service to the good old Gentleman. We dined one day with tms and his Lady, where. we met Auks and his whole Family. The Day pasted very agreeably and with great Good-Hu^ mour 5 we were all entertained with a Welcome apparently fincere, and the whole Society Seemed to know the true USe of affeiribling together, namely, that of receiving and git^ing pleaSure. Auks invited us to Spend the next Day with him; but there the contrary of every thing which had So pleaSed me the day before, appear’d. Luxury abounded to Such a degree, that the Table Seemed Spread rather with a De-Sign of catching the Eye, than of gratifying the Appetite. Statius and his Wife were So out of humour, that they could hardly command themSelves enough to keep lip to the common Rules of Civility; whilst: Auks and his Wife Seemed to be inwardly delighted with Something they could Scarcely contain ; and the Lady threw herSelf into So many Postures, that I was afraid she was going into Convulfions; but have stnce learn’d it was Joy unutterable.

iSnouLDbe very glad to be acquainted with the young Woman, who had Resolution strong enough to endure Pain, in order to affist another; for her Goodnefs must be very uncommon. The Generality of the human Species cannot be So bad, but that striking Objects of MiSery must "	raiSg

raiSe Some Small degree of Compassion. A strong Fire will bend even Iron; and Marble itSelf must yield to the irressstable Force of the Artist’s proper and well-adapted Tools. And yet it cannot be denied, but the Nature of Marble or of Iron is to be hard, whilst every languid Heat will move the Soft, the pliable Nature of Wax : Nor can the bending Ofier refist the fmallest Force. So Some Minds reSembling Marble or Iron in Hardnefs, are yet not totally impenetrable, whilst others in SoftneSs partaking the Nature of Wax, melt at every Woe, and embrace every Opportunity of extending and diffu-fing their Goodnefs. Of this latter Sort niust your young Woman be; and therefore her Want of Fortune is really to be deplored.
I Very much -admire, and greatly esteein Delus; but am not in the least Surprized at your finding So many People unwilling to believe his generous Actions: For Men very hardly give any Credit, when they hear of others practising, what tjiey know themfelves to be incapable of doing.

For there are very few People, who do mt argue with themSelves ist this manner: Whatever GoodneSs, whatever Under-standing Human Kind can boast of, I am endowed with to the utmost perfection j therefore it is impostible this Reptile^ So much beneath me in understanding, So greatly my inferior in every good Qua-lity.

Wifely preserves that DroSs, which in his bWn pur-blind Eyes appears most valuable.
A Bad DiSpofition appears most plain in dehyrng the Poffibility of a good Action 5 for there is a wide difference between being overcome by Temptation, when Passions with Im^etqofity urge us on, and actihg deliberately, Wheh the Judgment has fair play, and power to exert its utmost Force. That Venom in our own Bofoms proved, that MiSchief is our Delight, and Goodnelfe our Aversson.
Your Account of Auhts*s and Std.tius% Entertainments puts me in mind of Scenes I have been daily witnefs of: for nothing is So common, as Mens ruining them-Selves, to shew others they are not already ruin’d. Aulus may forgive Statius^ but Statim never will Aldus, For Vanity fatis-stei often turns into Good-humour, if that can be call’d So, which is only a Triumph over another’s. Paiui whereas unSatisfied Vanity creates Envy, fiets and gnaws the Heart of Whomsoever, it takes possessibri; and, unable to contain itSelf, breaks out in L 4	Tyranny

Tyranny to every Inferior; and with every Equal, in PeeviShneSs, when preSent; or, when abSent, in malicious Invectives.
I Heartily wifh the three Brothers you mention, may really reform their Principles, and mend the DiSpofition of their Minds, by their fuffering the DistreSs they deferve from their former Behaviour; but I greatly doubt it: for Men, like Children under the LaSh of the Rod, promiSe, and really believe they will do So' no more; but on the first Temptation, forget the Smart and relapfe to the following the Bent of their own Natures. Few Minds are So very bad, that great Adverfity will not humbfe them: befides, So broad and various are the Paths that lead to MiSer}^, that all Mankind can travel in them without jostling one another. Here alone the Preheminence is joyfully given : whereas the narrow, the pointed Pinaclc, of what M^^ call Profperity, can hold but few; and the Sufpicion each Individual has of every one who comes near him, makes idm endeavour to throw others down, that
their

their Distance may prevent their being and Obstruction to his Schemes.
But if the human Mind was as veno^ pious and malignant, as it has pleaSed Some Authors to represent it; iS Men had but Understanding enough to know their own true Interest, they would not be So often guilty of destroying that of their Friends: for in the epd I have generally pbServed their own Desttuction has been the CojiSe-quence.
A Gentleman, who was with Va--lentine yesterday, when I received your Letter, and who has enjoyed all the Pleasures of Life, by having both Abilities and Taste to do good, faid, he had lately been told the Story of a Man’s Life by him-Self, which Shewed, how much Men procure their own MiSery,. when they fancy there is any pleafure in pulling others down. I begged the Gentleman to relate the Story; and, as he is always willing to oblige, he told me, that Jie had long been acqi^inted with an old Gentleman, on whofe Countenance he obServed fo fixed a Melancholy,

' I could not exclude that gnawing VuU ' ture Eivvy^ from my BoSom; and every ' Proof of Admiration or Esteem I re-‘ ceived, was poiSoned, by the Fear of his ‘ having a larger share.

that they inspired me with I^oye, but I could not bear that Stephen should be happier than mySelf.

This Behaviour stung me to the Heart; for I could not but See the Beauty of GoodneSs and Simplicity like his : I wapted to rob him eyen of that;

But if the Per-fons he has thus treated, are filly enough to be impofed on by him, and take his IIon-fenfe for real Wifdom, or his ridiculous Pride for a friendly Difpofition, and fall into the Snare of thinking him of Gonfe-quence enough to confult him on any fu^ ture Qccafion, then he is in his Kingdom:

But, instead of joining with your Opinion of Pamfitilus., I should rather fancy, his Manner of talking ariSes from a benevolent Delight to dwell on the Virtues of Mankind; and that being unfortunate in his Acquaintance, for want of another Object, his Praifes unavoidably fall on hiihSelf; or,
at
224 L E T T E R
at the worst, I can only think he has Some ffew Failings, which he is So nicely conscious oS, that he talks of his own Good-neSs, to throw off the Thoughts oS even thoSe tristing Blemishes, which are too apt to fix strongly in his Mind.
The harden’d Murderer hears of his Crimes without a Blufh, whilst the poor Wretch, who has been driven by his PaS-fions to Such a Deed, without Premeditation, trembles at the Name of Murderer; and, by the ConSciouSnefs of his Fault, discovers himfelf. So that what you Say, in my opinion, makes against yourSelf, and Shews Pamphilus in a different light from what you would repreSent him. As to Se* limena, perhaps ill Health makes her fretful j or stie may have Some hidden Grief which you are a Stranger to; or it is not impostible but her great Innocence, and Fear of having acted wrong, may be the Caufe of that Uneafinefs She Shews at all her past Actions.
But how could you interpret the great Charity of a Man, who bestowed what he
wanted
LETTER XI. 225
wanted himSelf to relieve others. So very falsty, as to impute it to Pride. Undoubted-^ ly his rejoicing that the Beggar thought him able to give, has Some appearance of what you Say; but I make no question oS your misunderstanding him, and rather believe his own Poverty made him the more Senfible of that of others. Nor do I doubt, but that the Man you deScribe So finely dreffed, would alSo have been charitable ; only the GiddineSs of ProSperity often hinders People from giving themSelves time to refledt. As to your Account of' BorilaSy and his ReaSons for loving to give his Friends Advice, I am certain you must laugh yourSelf at the Ridicule of it, and had only a mind to shew how many ways you could turn Mens Adlions; for I ani certain, you cannot think any PerSon would take the pains of advifing another, but from the hopes of doing him good. Perhaps Dorilas may be a little sharp in his Rebukes ; but that can be for no other reafon, than becaufe he thinks it neceffary to cure his Friends of their Follies.

As to Scaurus and his Lady, I think you are much too Severe upon them; Sor their trifling Frailties, and what you call Affectation and Pride, is only a CareleffneSs of Temper, which makes them follow the Examples of others, without examining nicely whether they have any reaSon for So doing : They confider not the difference of their own Situation, and that of thofe above them.
Now I think I have mentioned every one you Speak of in your Letter, and fancy^-if you would give yourfelf time to recolledt every Circumstance, you will find you have very little reaSon for that Satire, of which you are So lavish : I am Sure if you have,, you are very unfortunate in your Companions. I am So happy, as to be got into the most agreeable Acquaintance imagk liable*.

lier Manner. There are people who call her dull., and Say she has an affedled Dig^ nitf., which she wants to imppSe on the Injudicious, as a Mark of her strong Understanding ; but for my part, I think it is very vifible, she has a philofophic Turn of Mind, and is really above thoSe Trifles, with which the: Generality of Women are de-^ lighted. It is true, she is not very hand-Some ; but then there is Something So inexpressibly agreeable in her, as in my Opinion fully compensates the Want of Beauty. yI\{% Fanny Brown h handfome, and gen?, teel to a miracle; and So lively, that I am never tired of being in her Company. Some Gendemen here, who love to find faulti do not fcruple to Say, she delights in hearing herSelf talk, and babbles NonSenSe all day long j but they are mightily mistaken j for I think she cannot Speak too much, be-cauSe she is pleafing in every Word and Addon. •
Mrs. Scare-Crow is So genteel and eafy, that I don’t think she would meafure above a Span round her Waist; and from her being fiender, is So very light and nimble, N 2	that
228 L E T T E R XI.
that she in a manner Aides from one place to another without any trouble : she looks So pale and delicate, that I am almost in love with her, every time I am So happy as to be in Kvr Company.
Then here is Mrs. Cherry-Cheek, who is So plump, and has Such a vifible Content in her Countenance, as plainly indicates her Good-humour; and, notwithstanding what iome few are So Satirical to Say, namely, tliat her ThoUghtleffneSs alone cauSes her to be So gay and merry; yet I don’t believe, but that being obliging and agreeable, is in her the ReSult of Refiedtion, as well as her own natural good DiSpofition. In short, Were I to deScribe all the handfome, genteel, well-bred, gGod-natiiredL'^6\ts here, I should tire you, and make no end of writing. '

Last Week (for the SeaSon is now almost at the height) arrived Mr. Demure., who is .always talking of grave Subjects, and yet always in an entertaining manner s as alfo Mr. STrickfey, who dresses So fine, and dances fo charmingly, that I am never tired with looking at him. In a word, I am the happieji Creature here in the world; all the Company are agreeable to me, and are my very good Friends; and I doubt not, but, iS I had any occafion to try them I should find them very ready to Serve me.

Dear Leonora, [Prom the Country.
SINCE my Retirement into the Country, the natural Indolence of my Temper inSenfibly steals upon me ; and with an pxception only oS the time I Spend in reading, I can hardly Say I am alive. You know I love London.^ not becauSe I am very fond of great Gaiety and publick Diverlions; but becauSe it is So much eafier there to come at the Converfation I like. In this place I cannot help fometimes falling into the utmost Stupidity: However, as either my Father’s Circumstances makes it most convenient, or his Choice most pleaSant to him, to retire, I Submit without repining. I can affure you, the Reflection that you are in the Part of the World you chufe, is one of the, greatest Pleafures I now enjoy. I haye al-N 4	ways

This Place is fo dull, it is impoffible for me to Send you any thing Sprightly or gay; though I have at prefent a Companion in the HouSe who is my great Comfort. Before the Roads were impaffable, (as now four long tedious Winter-Months have render'd them) my Father carried me about five Miles off to vifit hindamirUy who is lately married to his most intimate Acquaintance and near Neighbour.

But when I heard her call her Sister, I was glad to turn my Refledions another way ; and being already prepoffeffed in her Favour by her charming PerSon, was pleaSed to think, that her Good-nature equalled her Beauty. I was So taken up with admiring Linda-mira, that it was Some time before I took any particular notice of Lydia^ (for that was her Sister’s Name 5) but as by Importunity we were prevailed on to stay there a Week, I had time enough to get well acquainted with her,

My Father and the Gentleman rode out every day, both for their Diverfion and Health ; by which means I had an Opportunity oS observing Lydid.s DeSormity was all on the Outfide. When the Company was mixed, I thought fhe Seemed to know herSelS So well, as not to expedl any oS the Gentlemen Should hearken to her with more Attention than common Civility demanded. She Said but little, till she was left with only Lindamira and mySelf. Then She threw off all Restraint, and at once discovered Such a Refinement in her Sentiments^ and Such a GoodneSs of Heart as Surprized me,
I Could not help condemning mySelf for having been at first light So prejudiced by her PerSon. We Soon took So great a fancy to each other, that by a very, short Acquaintance we became intimate. LirF damira has generally a vast deal, of Company with her in town, where she is at prefent; and as loves Retirement, I begged the favour of her to. stay with me till her Sister’s Return. She had not been
long
LETTER XII. 235
long with me, before I perceived by her Conversation, that Some remarkable Incidents had befallen her in the Courfc of her LiSe. Curiofity led me to inquire into her History; and upon my request, she obliged me, by beginning as follows :
“Ala s ! Madam, my Misfortunes “ began at an Age when most People ima-“ gine we are incapable of having any. “ But this I know by woeful Experience “ to be a very great Mistake; for altho’ “ Children cannot extend their Views far “ enough to have any Cares for the future, “ yet are they as fuSceptible of Suffering “ from what is prefent, and more fo (as “ their Reafon is weaker) thap grown-up “ People.
“My Father was naturally inclined to “ be a good Man, but of a carelefs Dif-“ pofition, and fo fond of his Wife, that “ he had an implicit Faith in whatever Ilie “ Said. My Mother, from a peculiar en-gaging Softnefs in her Manner, pasted in “ the World for a very good-natur’d Wo-^ man; but I am certain by the Treat-
“ ment
236 LETTER XII.
“ ment I met with from her, that Vanity “ was the Sole Motive of almost ^11 her “ Actions.
" You See, Madam, the Deformity of ‘ my Perfon; I am Sure I have rcaSon to know it; for from the time I can rs-^ member, I have heard of little elSe. My ' Mother, instead of being moved to Com-^ pafiion by an Object which I should ' have thought was naturally formed to ’ raiSe it, looked on me as the Monument ■ of her Shame, and could not bear the ’ Thought that I was her Child. She ' ufed me like a Monster in Nature j and I verily believe, had it Iiot been for fear her own Reputation might Suffer by it, stie would have endeavoured to have prevailed on my Father utterly to abandon me. Little ugly Wretch^ Pigmy all the opprobrious Names she could think on, she thought proper to bestow on me. I was always inclined to be tender in my Difpofition, and deSirous to be fond of my Parents, if they had been kind enough to have indulged me in that Pleafure. I was five Years old

when Lindamira was born: yon See her preSent Beauty; and from an Infant she was always the fame. My Mother’s Love for her equal’d her Hatred to me.

' but ordered the Servants to let me come ' to her as feldom as poshble, for fear the ‘ beautiful Child should be shocked at ‘ the fight of fo much Deformity. This ' she never fcrupled to fay before my face; ‘ nay, she feemed to take a delight in ‘ hurting me by all she Ways she could ‘ invent; and young as I then was, she ‘ obtained her cruel Defires by often pier-‘ cing me to the Soul. I loved to be ‘ with my pretty Sister; and she often ex-‘ tended her little Hands to me, which ‘ gave me great pleafure. But this too “ was denied me. I had no Refuge, but “ often got into Corners, and cry’d Hours “ by mySelf, till my Eyes became fo weak “ I could hardly fee.
“This cruel USage, by the time I was “ ten Years old, made me hate to come “ near my Mosher: she was doubly pleaSed “ wish it, as it steed her from my Sight,

and gave her an Opportunity of instil-“ ing into my Father, that my Mind was as deSormed as my Body ; for that I had an averfion even to my Parents. He “ had never taken much notice oS me, but leSt me to the Management of his Wife, whom he thereSore thought must know me best; and consequently Soon “ came to hate me as much as she did. When any Company came to theHouSe, if they took any the least notice of me my Mother from that moment conceived an unconquerable Averfion for them.
Thus was I abhorred by my Parents, debarred converfing with my Sister, shut out from every Method of improving my Mind; in short, my Situation was So deplorable, that it is impossible to give you an adequate Idea of it: and the Source of all this Mifery was, that my Mosher’s Vanity was piqued at the Deformity of her Offspring. Tears and heart-breaking Sighs were my constant Employment; and under the Burthen of this most barbarous Ufage did I waste ; my hateshl Life, till I was Thirteen j

I took her up “ in my Arms, and joyfully embraced this “ Opportunity of playing with her* She “ Seemed pleaSed with it, and for that mo-“ ment I forgot all my Griefs. Here “ again how dearly did I pay for only “ that short Refpite from Pain! for my “ Foot stumbled against a Stone that lay “ in the way, I fell down; and with my “ utmost Care could not prevent striking “ the Child a Blow in the Forehead. The “ Sudden Anguish Set her a crying fo loud; “ that it immediately brought out her fond Mother to know the Caufe of it • “ but when she faw me, and by my own Confeffion found the Accident I had had, her Fury was too great to be expreffed. “ She, after giving me a Look which per-“ fedly frightned me, fnatched up her “ darling Lindamira., and ran with her “ to my Father; where by Tears, affirm-“ ing that I hated and envied my Sister, “ becauSe she was handfome, and expref-“ Sing her Fears that I should do her Some “ greater miSchief, she at last worked

“ I Knew not where to go; myFh “ gure, I was very Senfible, would draw on me Contempt and Scorn. The Per-“ Sons from whom alone I had a right to “ claim Protection, were my Enemies;
what then could I expect firom Strangers? “ Yet difmal asmyProSpect was, I Set out “ from home, to expoSe mySelf to any “ MiSery, So that I might avoid the Sight of “ my cruel Parents.

Inhabitants, and dragged to my wretched home again; I thereSore diredfed my Steps through By-paths, and Sorlorn Places, wishing I might never See a human Face again. My Mind for a long time was So involved in the Refieftion of what I had already fuffered, that I lost all Con-fideration for the future; and the lively Idea of my past Sorrows, took from me all Feeling of the many wearifome Steps I trod : But Nature at last, funk and worn out with Fatigue, required Rest; the Night came upon me before I was aware of it, (So entirely was I destitute of all Thoughts for my own Safety;) I knew my Way to no Houfe, nor indeed if I could have found one, had I any great reafon to hope, it was in my power to have raiSed Compaffion enough for me, to find any Shelter, or meet with any Protedlion. The Weather happened to be very hot, and I at last rcSolved to lay down under a great Tree, till the returning Day-light might enable me to purSue my-Way, or rather to wander Sriendlefs, wfithout having any Way to find.

“The Perturbation oS my Thoughts at length exhausted my Strength, and I in-Senfibly fell into a Sound Sleep, in which I continued till the Morning, when I was startled by the hollowing and hooping oS a Set of Boys, whom I afterwards heard were going to School, to a Village about two Miles distant. They stood still, and stared at me for Some time, and at last burst into a violent Fit of Laughter. I was frighted at the Consideration, that I was in the power of Wretches, who could think me a fit Object for Mirth, and began to walk. The ' foremost of them cryed out. Do you think to efcape us So eaSily, you little Baboon ? with your leave we must have Some Sport with you before you forSake us. Then they all Surrounded me in Such a manner, that it was impossible for. me to get out of their hands; and after faying all the most ill-natur’d things they could think on, they began to pinch and beat me for the Diverfion (as they term’d it) of feeing in how many Postures I could turn my beautiful Perfon.

I had not long bemoan’d my own unhappy Fate, before an old Woman came by, and aSk’d me by what means I came to be left in that Posture } By her ashing that Q^ef-tion, I conceived fome hopes, that it was her Defign to fet me at liberty, and began to relate to her what barbarous USage had forced me from my Father’s HouSe.

( 255 )
LETTER XIII.
Leonora to Delia, in the Country^
Dear Delia,
[From London.
ITH A N K you for your Letter, and that Part of Lydia’^ Story you have already Sent me ; and it would be difficult to determine, whether it gave me more PleaSure or Pain. That you are confined to the Country, when you would chuSe to be in Town, must give me Some UneafineSs; and yet your chearful Resignation to your Duty, in obeying your Father, not only alleviates that UneafineSs, but makes me rejoice in your ReSolution to Submit to what you think reaSonable. For real Affection has a twofold PleaSure, as it rejoices both in the PleaSure and GoodneSs of its Object.
If
256 LETTER XIII.
I F the human Mind has any Passion or SenSation to which we can properly give the Name of Love, that Passion must be gratified, whenever the Objedt of it is pleaSed, even though we have no farther share in fuch Pleafure but what Ressedtion brings us. And this does not at all contradict the Maxim, Lhat Self-Love is the Source of all our ASiions.
Now that this Subject is in my thoughts, it brings to my Remembrance two Gentlemen (the one warmed with the Idea of Benevolence, and the other heated with the Notion that there is no Such thing, but in the chimerical Invention of Man’s Brain) who argued in the following mariner:
\fl Gent, M y Friend^ you are always talking of Benevolence and Good-nature, and Love, and heaping together a Sett of Words that have no Meaning; for I am convinced by the general Tenor of Mens Actions, that they Iovq nothing but them-felves.
2d Gent,
letter XIII. 257
2d Gent. Pray, Sir, if the word Love has no Meaning at all, how come Men to love themfelves ? For whatever we feel for others (tho’ in ever fo Small a degree) if it arifes from the fatne Passion that makes us feel for our* Selves, it certainly deServes the Same Name.
ijl Gent. O H 1 not at all. Pride may make us feel for ourfelves what we cast in no degree feel for others.
2d Gent. And what is Pride ?
ijl Gent. It is as much as I cast do to forbear laughing at the Question. Is there any Man fo ignorant, that he knows not what Pride is ?
2d Gent, 1 for Information, Sir; Contempt is no AnSwer : nor fhall I be the wiSer, or you the better, for that ridiculous Sneer, which rather raiSes my Pity than my Anger.
ifl Gent. Then, stnce you require a^r rious AnSwer to your Question, Pride is y © L. I.	P	Oste
258 LETTER XIII.
one of the strongest Paflions Implanted iss the Mind of Man. It is the Passion, by which we are ostenest actuated, and in exerting which, we find our own Superiority either over Some other Species, or Some Individual of our own,
2d Gent. And pray how came we by this Passion.?
iji Gent, You might as Well ash me how I came by my Eyes.
2d Gent. Perhaps your Anfwerto this may lead you to more than you imagine.
iji Gent, Why then, I believe it is a Passion implanted in us by our wife Creator, to make us emulate each other in great and noble Actions.
2d Gent. Perhaps that is true: But why then Should you assert there is no fuch Passion as Love implanted in us for as great and as wife Ends ? I assert poss-tively, that I do Suffer for others Sufferings, and rejoice in their PleaSure, for no other
ReaSon
L £: T T E R XIII. 259
ReaSon, but becauSe they Suffer or are pleaSed. And this I call Benevolence or Love: IS you can affign it to another CauSe with any colour of ReaSon, I will no longer dispute it with you.
iji Gent. If what you Say is true, why do all Mankind purSue their own Gratifications, without the Confideration of any thing but themSelves ?
2d Gent. I Think your Accufation much too general ^ f^ numberkfs Examples can be produced to the contrary ; and where it happens So, it is no Proof that there is no Such Paffion as Love; but only, that Self-Idme has the greatest Predc-minancy over the Miml, and that the Paf-fions contend with each other. Your darling Paffion Pride is often overcome by Fear; and yet I fancy you will not, for that Reafon, deny its Existence in the Mind.
ift Gent. Ay, Pride, it is true, is my darling Paffion; it is that alone that produces great and good A.dtions. Indeed I P 2	49
^6o letter XtIL
do allow. Fear may have Some influence over the low and vulgar Part of Mankind; but as to Love, there is no fuch thing; No ! — there can be no fuch thing.
Here the two Gentlemen parted, the one with a heavy Heart, that his Companion was, in his opinion^ in an error, and the other triumphing and exulting in the Superior Penetration he was convinced he poS‘ feffed above his Friend.
Those Gentlemen who pofitively deny any Pity or Compafiion to inhabit the human Breast, make their Fellow-Creatures a worfe Compliment than Milton made even his Satan; for he allows him Some Mixture of the foster Passions, tho’ outweigh’d by Revenge and Pride; as appears plainly by the following Speech, when first the envious Fiend beheld Adam and Eve in BliSs before their Fall.
O Hell! What do mine Eyes with Grief beholdV

It is very vifible, that Milton not only ynakes the Devil have Sonie Compaffion, but alSo thinks it necelTary to make him rested: on Honour and Empire, before even he, though damned, can, unprovoked, re-Solve on the Cruelty oS destroying others HappineSs, I mentioned this Speech once to a Lady who doated on Miltm, and had read him twenty times; when, after con-stdering a moment, fhe laid, “ She was V Sure Milton did not mean, that the Devil had any Compastlon, but only that he ^ was deceitful.’’ This Lady forgot, that

LEONORA,

LETTER XIV.
Delia to Leonora at London.
Deal Leonora, \Erom the Country,
OUR Dialogue between the two Gentlemen about Pride and Benevolence, brings to my Remembrance the Charafler of a Man, with whom I Sor-merly Spent a great deal oS my Time. His Name was Xantippus. A strong Friendship betyveen me and his Sister, brought me into an intimate Acquaintance with him; the Love I vjSibly perceived She had Sor him, at first gave me a great Esteem for him; till one day accidentally I dined with them; when he rail’d at Mankind with Such Virulence, and dropped Such bitter Fxpreflions against his Fellow-Creatures, that I could not forbear thinking he was the most ill-natur’d Man, that was ever born.
The
LETTER XIV. 265
The next time I met my Friend, she ashed me with a Smiling Countenance, what I thought of her Brother. To tell her my Opinion of him, I imagined, would be both cruel and rude; and therefore made her very little AnSwer. But my being reserved to her was fo uncommon, that my very Manner let her into my Sentiments ; and, being unwilling that I should entertain a falfe Opinion of her Brother, she gave me the following ReaSons fpr tippus\ Behaviour.
You must know, Delia, that Mens apparent Hatred of Mankind often arifes froiii the real Love of them; and, not-withstanding that Xantippus, by his Be-“ haviour, gave you fo ill an Opinion of “ him, yet he is one of the best-natured “ Men in the World. It is no uncom-*‘^mon thing for Men to fall into Pashons, “ when hurt by thofc they love. This “ was the Cafe, the day he railed fo at his “ own Species. One of his Friends had ' * refuSed him a Trifle, which would have cost hjm very little Trouble orExpcnce
"‘to
266 LETTER XIV.
“ to have granted him; and his Grief at this “ RefuSal, made him for the preSent quarrel with all the Worlds But the next day, “ another Friend’s obliging him in a Trifle^ “ made him turn Mankind into Angels.
XANTIPPUS has So strong an
■	Imagination, that he lets it have an In-
■	fluence over even his PhiloSophyj and
■	he thinks of Mankind, just as they hap^ pen to pleafe or difpleash him. When he thinks it just to hate the World, he works' himSelf up into a Pastion, till he fancies he does So : But this artificial Ill-nature (if I may be allowed that Ex-prestion) vanishes, when any opportunity offers of exerting it. And, as the Cat in the fable, who was turn’d to a Woman, the moment the MouSe appear’d, forgot her late affumed Charader, and purfued her Prey; So I have known my Brother, after making himSelf believe that he ought, and therefore did hate Mankind, in-a minute’s Space exert himfelf to the utmost, to Serve Men, when he could have no other reaSon for So doing, but a general and uncommon
“ Benevolence,
LETTER XIV. 267
Benevolence. We ought therefore not always to judge of Men by their Words (which often flow only from the preSent ' Humour arifing from the last Accident ■ that has hefallen them) but by their ' A(sti6ns. A Man who is naturally in-' dined to love his Fellow-Creatures, if ' he meets with good Ufage, will praiSe ' themif with ill U&ge, it is most like-‘ ly he will Sometimes rail at them. I ‘ SuppoSe you don’t imagine, that all the ‘ Writers of Satires upon Women, hated ‘ them ; when I read thoSe Satires, I pity ‘ the Authors; becauSe I know, when ^ People vent virulent Reproaches, that ‘ they have met with Some great DiSap-‘ pointment,’^
ITifANJCEn my Friend for undeceiving me, and fM*omifed her, that for the future I would not be So. hasty in forming my Judgment. I greatly rejoiced with her, that I had been mistaken in the Character of Xantippusfor I knew She loved her Brother; and, if my Opinion had been just: of him, I am fure stie must have been very unhappy.
1
268 LETTER XIV.
I Cannot help being diverted at the Criticism oS the Lady you mention, on Milton', and yet on confideration, I am Sorry there is any perSon, who could make Such a Remarks For, what must a' Woman be, who is So very Sure, that trying to deceive is always uppermost, that she will not let even Milton be any Judge of the Charader he is painting ? If this Lady has met with any one So unfortunate, as to have any regard for her, I am afraid that Perfon will find, that it is not onlj the Devil, who would fet open Hell-Gates to entertain thoSe they feek in mutual A-mity.
I F o R G E T, that I am all this time detaining you from the Remainder of the Story you defired. The next time Lydia was with me alone. She proceeded as follows.
‘‘ I Lived Seven Years with MiSs Brompton; and, altho’ I can’t fay I was “ So miserable as when at home (as ill U-“ Sage from a Stranger fat lighter on me,
“ than
LETTER XIV. 269
than when I received it from my Parents) yet I was very unhappy. MiSs Prompt ' torfs Education had been quite contrary ’ to mine ; for, tho’ my Mother’s Vanity went no farther than to wiSh her , Off-' Spring amiable, yet fhe could See when ' they were not So; but her Mother went ■ to So immoderate a height, that fhe was ' blinded to the Imperfections of every 'thing fhe thought her imn-, and bred ' up this young Creature with a Notion,
' that she was perfectly the ObjeCt of Ad-' miration. This, when she grew a Wo-' man, and found that Men could converSe ' with her, without being So much taken ‘ with her Charms as she expeCted, Sour’d ' her Temper, and made her envy and ‘ hate every thing that was handfome, and ' joyfully embrace every opportunity cf ‘ turning into Ridicule every one whom ‘ she Saw more unhappy in her Perfon,
‘ than herfelf. She could not have met ‘ with any thing more agreeable to her in ^ that reSpeCt, than I Was: Instead of ‘ looking on me with Compashon, the ‘ Sight of me was the greatest PleaSure ‘ she had, becauSe her own Vanity was
“ never
270 letter XIV.
“ never Sd fully Satisfied, as when She look’d
at me.
“ Wh EN we were alone. She was Some-^ times tolerably kind to me ; but, when-‘‘ ever any Company came to the Houst, “ they were to be entertained at my Ex-pence; I was the Raree-Shttw produced “ to divert them : And it is almost incre-‘S dible how many WitticiSms my unhappy “ PerSon afforded. Had not Sad Experience taught it me, I could never have believed “ Such Numbers of People as vifited MiSs “ Prompt on (for She had a great Acquaintance all round the Country) could have har-“ boured fo much Malignity in their “ Hearts. There were indeed Some few “ Exceptions; but they were looked on “ by the rest to be tastelefs and infipid.
“ I Was unwilling to let Emilia know the Treatment I met with, fearing, lest “ She Should either think me ungrateful, “ in repining at any thing that befel me where She had placed me; or that, if “ She had it not in her power to re-‘‘ drefs nte, I might give her Some Un-
“ eaSincSs:
LETTER XIV. 271
V eaSmeSs: But, as I am naturally open and unreServed in my Temper, I one day let her into it unawares. Tears stood in “ the good Creature’s Eyes, at the thoughts oS any one’s being capable of fo much “ Barbarity. I know not which way, Said she, to help it: if I Speak to MiSs Bromp-“ ton of it, perhaps She will not keep you “ at all 5 and I dare not have you home, for I have no power there. My Spirits are almost worn out by the continual “ Drea^ I live in. I love QuietneSs and “ Peace So well, that I take all the care I can, not to offend, but it is in vain; for “ I am found fault with, becaufe it’s for my good', tho’, I am convinced, it is only to “ vent the ill Tempers of thoSe in whoSe “ power I am. Thus you See my Situa-tion is not much happier than yours; and I would have you comfort yourSelf in “ the restedtion, that you are only the “ fancied Object of Ridicule, while MiSs “ Brompton is really So.
‘‘At this DiScourfe my own'Sorrows “ were all fwallow’dand lost in theThougbts J‘ of my dear Emilia't; and from that time
272 LETTER XIV.
I began to accustom mySelf to a Con-“ tempt of the People, who could miSuSe “ me for what I could no ways help.
“ I Oft EN wish’d to fee Lindamira-^ “ for, as I did not envy her, but on the “ contrary, was glad the Beauty of her Per-“ Son would exempt her from my MiS-“ fortunes, I really loved her : but did not “ dare to make any Enquiries, for fear I Should be forced to go home again.
“ I Had once, while I was at MiSs ‘‘ BromptorC^., a ProSpedl of having every " thing I wish’d; for Emilia's Beauty en-gaged the Admiration of st young Gentle-“ man, who was in the Poffefiion of a ‘‘ great Estate ; and, if this had Succeeded, “ I had no reaSon to doubt, but she would “ take me to live with her. However, “ this fail’d through MiSs BromptoEs Envy “ and Malice; for she had the So much “ admired Talent of turning others into “ Ridicule; which, as it must be a very great Entertainment to every ilhnatur’d “ Perfon, will always keep whoever is poS-y SelTed of it, stom being melancholy for

Our young Spark was amongst the number of thofe who took great delight in this manner of Conversation, which drew him often to our HouSe* He had no Taste for Emilid.% Understanding or GoodneSs ; it was her PerSon only he liked: for her Wit, as it was joined with Good-nature, Served to refine her Sentiments, and'make the Soft^ neSs of her Heart yet more engaging, by instrudting her in what manner She could best follow her own Inclination of giving others pleaSure. But MiSs BromptoEs Satirical Strokes, and ill-natur’d Turns were much more Suited to his Palate. In short, she found Some method of making Emilia (who never in the least Sufpeded her) appear to him in fo ridiculous a light, that -she broke off the Match.
“ I Happened accidentally one day to over-hear her at this Diverlion 5 my “ Rage was So great, that I could hardly “ refrain telling her how treacheroufly she “ was acting by one, to whom she pre-tended to be a Friend. However I did Vor. I. Q	command

LETTER XiV. 275
“ E MI L I A promised that she would try to get me a Place, but in the meaii time begg’d I would take no notice of what had happen’d; for she did not defign to make a public quarrel on Such an occafion, but would drop Mifs Prompt tod.s Acquaintance as quietly as poshble. I obeyed her Injundions; and, as I stay’d there but a very little while afterwards, I was not long under that Restraint; Sor in leSs than a Week Emilia came to me, and told me, she believed she had heard of Lindamira. Nothing could have given me greater pleafure: I heartily begged her to Satisfy my Curiofity, by informing me what she knew of my Sister.
“The good-natur’d Emilia immediately complied with my Request, and Said, she dined the day before about eight Miles off, at a Tenant’s of her Father’s, where the good Woman, by way of A-mufement, told her a Story of a Gentleman and Lady, who died within a Week of each otlier, and left behind them a Q_2	!!

“ told me, that she had often heard her “ lament my hating her ; for that from the time I went aw^y, my Mother had con-“ stantly poffeffed her, that I did So; and “ that she frequently faid, if I could have “ had an Affedion for her, she should have thought herSelf happy in returning it. “ This was the very Temper I wished to find her of; and did not at all doubt but “ I should Soon convince her of my good Intentions towards her; but thought it ‘‘ adviSeable, if Slie should wake SenSible, “ not to hurry her Spirits, by letting her “ immediately See me. I went and Sat in “ the next Room, waiting with impatience V to fee the Effect her Sleep would have “ on her.

This faithful Creature did it in fuch a manner, that she convinced Lindamira of my Affedtion for her, and made her wish to See me, complaining how much I had been wronged. But the Raptures I felt when my newfound Sister admitted me to her Bed-Side, and treated me like a Friend, are not to be deScribed. It would be end-leSs and unnecessary to repeat all our Conversation; but poor Lindamira figh’d at the Thought, that Vanity could have So strong an Influence over her Mother,' as to make her keep up a Hatred to her own Child even to the Grave.

“ I Was looking one Day out of the ‘ Window, when I Saw Emilia with a ‘ Gentleman coming in at the Gate.

Dear Delia,	\Erom London,
YO U cannot imagine the PleaSure the Conclufion oSLydid.s Story gave me; that She is at last as happy as She deServes to be, after all her unmerited Misfortunes, It gives me fo pleafing a Senfation, that it is much eafier felt than deScribcd: But on the other hand, I cannot help being melancholy, when I reflect on her being the Object of her Mother’s Barbarity, the Scorn of thofe ilLnatured Boys, whofe Cruelty tied her to the Tree, whence the good Emilia freed her; and on the Ridicule ®f that perfidious fa!fe Friend Mifs Bromp-ton, whofe Deceit and Rancour J am pleafed met with its just Reward,
What
LETTER XV. 285
What could tempt People unprovoked to make Lydid.s Form the Objedl of Mirth ? I dare not anSwer that Q^stion to mySelf; for the utmost Malignity prefents itSelf So strongly to my Imagination, that I cannot bear to look at the Pidfure. The true Lovers of Ridicule^ perhaps, might be much enraged to find, that Cruelty itSelf is the CauSe of half their Good-Humour (as they term it,) and be tempted to wonder at the Folly of Such as think Mirth is ever criminal. But let their Rage be ever So high, I must believe, that if thoSe who are con-vulSed into Laughter by improper Objedls, were bled, phyfick’d, and kept in a Regimen ufed to Lunaticks, till they are cured oS Such Convulfions, it would be for their own Emolument, and the publick Good.
That there are Objeds proper for Mirth, I do grant; and I think the following Paffage in the Preface to Jofeph An-, drewsy clearly and distinctly points out thofe Objects.
N ow

“ Now from Affectation only, the MiS-‘ fortunes and Calamities of Life, or the ‘ imperfections of Nature, may become ' the Objects of Ridicule. Surely he hath

*	mily shivering with Cold, and languish-' ing with Hunger, it would not incline Cus to Laughter, (at least we must have ‘ very diabolical Natures, if it would;) but ‘ should we discover there a Grate in-‘ stead of Coals, adorned with Flowers, ‘ empty Plate or China Disties on the Side-‘ Board, or any other Affectation of Riches ‘ and Finery either on their PerSons or in
“ their
letter XV. 287
their Furniture; we might then indeed “ be excuSed for ridiculing fo shntastical an “ Appearance. Much lest are natural Im-“ perfections the Object of Derifion: But “ when Uglinest aims at the ApplauSe of “ Beauty, or LameneSs endeavours to display “ Agility, it is then that theSe unfortunate “ Circumstances, which at first moved “ our Compastion, tend only to raiSe our “ Mirth.
“The Poet carries this very far;
“ None are for being what they are in “ fault
“ But for not being what they would be “ thought.
“ Where if the Metre would Suffer the “ word Ridiculous to clofe the first Line, “ the Thought would be rather more pro-“ per. Great Vices are the proper Ob-“ jects of our Detestation, Smaller Faults “ of our Pity. But Affectation appears “ to me the only true Source of the Ri-‘‘ diculous.’*
SUREI^Y
288 L E T T E R XV.
Surely Men who love laughing, cari never die of the Spleen, for want of Opportunities of indulging it, whilst that Grand Field of Affectation is left them, to wander and divert themfelves in. I wish therefore they would not makefalSe Objects of Ridicule : For thoSe who raife in themfelves Contempt for others, and laugh at shem without a CauSe, will alSo find Some ReaSon to hate them without a CauSe. The Love of triumphing over the Unfortunate or Imperfect, I believe always dwells in the fame Breast ; with the Defire of hurting thofe who are cither favoured by Fortune, or by Nature formed the proper Objects of Admiration.
The Thoughts of	Lydia^ and the
Deformity of her Perfon, put me in mind of a very odd Scene, I was witnefs of a Fortnight ago.
My Mother carried me to dine with Dqrcas, a Lady with whom she was very intimate in her Youth ; and therefore would not break off her Acquaintance with
her,
L E T T E R XV. 289
her fince her Marriage; tho’ she told me, that Dorcas was So altered, that she nov(r dissiked her Acquaintance; and bid me observe all the odd Scenes I should See very attentively*
When we arrived, we were lisher’d into a Dining-Room, wshere Dorcas was Sitting with her Hushand Bellmour. I Saw she had almost cried her Eyes outj nor could she conceal. it. Bellmour received us with great Civility, but look’d a little confuSed, and Said; his Whfe, poor Woman, had been very low-fpirited all day, and he hoped we would excuSe it We talked a little while oS indifferent things, when Dorcas Spoke now and then a wui i in So faint a Voice, that she could hardly be heard. I thought she had really been very ill, and pitied her; but on a Sudden, on the accidental mention of the word Servant, she fell into fuch a Rage, and talked fo loud, that I was furprifed, and afraid she was fuddenly run mad. She Said She was the most unfortunate Woman Vgl. I,	R	alive

alive in her Servants; She could get nd-‘ ‘ body that would obServe her Commands.” Then She enumerated Several Iiistances df the Difohedience of her Servants, Such as the misplacing of China Cups, her Toilets hot being in exact order, &c. and concluded with faying, Mr. Bellmour was So eafy with his Servants, that it was iiii-poffible for her ever to make any of them good for any thing. Bellmour replied, that She might turn them aWay, or do just as She pleaSed, for he never interfered; biit he could not be all day throwing himSelf into passions about nothing.-
This was a new Subject of Contention: for DorCas., as fast as stie could Speak for her Tears, Said, “ Oh ! noW her Ac-quaintance were all to be made believe, that She was a Very unreasonable Woman j “ that She Wanted to put her Hushand into PaSIions; She little thought, when she married him, that he would have been ■ ‘ fo cruel to have taken part with her
Servants against her.”

T H i s Dialogue lasted till Dinner, which was Served tip ih the most regular order, and where indeed Plenty Seem’d to abound 5 but nobody was the better for it; for it was Donas's Will to find fault, and She was re-fotved to be in the right. Now her Mif-fortstnes were all redoubled; one Dish, she Said, was under-dreffed, the other overdressed ; in short, nothing pleafed her; she coiild not eat raw Creatures., nor did she love her Meat fotlteh; Servants were always ih Extremes. The Table was pre-Ibhtly i&ihpty again, for she Sent aWay all the Servants with the different Dishes to ilate therh iry’d, broiSd, rhihc’dj in short, to haVe theni Sent up a different way.
All this time we fstt staring at each blher, and nobody Spoke but Dorcas, who gave her Hushahd Such furious .Looks, as if he had been guilty of treating her very ill j and every now and then it was hinted to the Company, that his Eafmefs. was the caufe of all her Misfortunes.

Howev ER, Time and Patience at last brought about my Deliverance; for I longed to be out of the Houfe.

A Gentleman in Yorkshire Simple at London,
SIR,	[From York.
IS H 0 U’D not, as I am an utter Stranger to you, give you this Trouble, had not the History of your Life Sufficiently convinced me, that you have no Defight equal to that of giving others PleaSure. In my preSent unhappy Situation, nothing can So much alleviate my UneafineSs, as an Opportunity of giving Vent to my Thoughts, by imparting them to another. To the Generality of Mankind I find as total an Impoffibility of explaining my own Senfa-tions, as it would be to make an Infant join or Separate Ideas, the moment it is born j for what Men never felt, they can-R 4	■	not

not understand; and, as they enjoy nothing So much as that Indulgence of their Pride, v^ihich makes them imagine them-Selves at the very Top of the Creation^ they join in ridiculing whatever they find is no Part of their own Nature ; therefore to you alone can I give the History of my Life, which I will now begin without any further Preface,
I W A s bred up in the fame manner with most young Gentlemen, who are Heirs to moderate Fortunes. Nothing remarkable happened to me, whilst I was a Boy. I contraded Several of thoSe Friendships, that are common at great Schools, which commence without any other reaSon, than the liking the fame Sort of Diverfions, and generally break off, either from being tired of thofe Diversions, or from the Envy, which a Superiority at a favourite Game often creates ; for at the proper Age, Children are as eager Rivals, when they are playing at Taw, as Men can be, where their Interest or their Love is concerned. 5ut I never quarrel’d with any one of my Companions, without Suffering three or four

Days MiSery for it, and on that account was often infulted, and treated ill by thoSe who knew my Temper.
A T the Age of One and Twenty, I lost my Father, which LoSs for the first Twelve-month dwelt on my Mind, and made me very uneafy j but Time got the better of st, and I gave into a Life of as great Gaiety, as my Fortune would permit.
Three or four Years I fpent in this manner, till this way of Life grew irkfomc to me j every thing I met with, was perfectly unsatisfactory and languid 5 I wish’d for Pleafure, and did not know where to find it. PurSuits I had none, for neither Ambition or Avarice ever poffefled my Mind; and I was fully contented as to Fortune, with what my Father had lest me: fo that, for want of fome motive to induce me to ACtion, I began to grow fo very indolent, that I could not bring mySelf to ufe Exercife enough to keep me in health. The Body shared fhe Infirmities of its Ally, the Mind, and
every
zqd letter xvl
fvery thing aronnd me appeared ttaffelefs f,nd infipid.
Wearied out with daily Seeing the Same dull Sgene over again, I at last began tQ rouSe myfelf, and Seriousty to confider^ whether there wa? m PurSuit worth my following, no State of Life, in which I could he happy. The more I reflected, the stronger were my Conelufions, that your Scheme was the only one, which could postibly produce me any PleaSure or Satisfaction of Mind, A Companion either in a Man or Woman, who could have a difinterested Affection for me, appeared to my Imagination to be the only Happinest I was capable of enjoying; I therefore re^ felved to mahe a Friend of the first Man,, or marry the first Woman I could esteem.
But I was not fo happy as to meet with even your Mifs yobnjhn ^ for she he-^ fitated greatly, whether she should prefer immenfe Riches to ypur generous. Love^ whereas I was fo unfortunate as to find, in a short Acquaintance with all the Ladies I addreffed, that the Spectator’s Story of
the

the L^y’s giving the Pre%mc^. to thi\t Lpver, who could bq^st 4 Pidgeou-Houft naOjre on his	th^n hi;S Ant^gonift,
W4S in no degree unnatural,.
Amongst the Men indeed^ I had Nurnfeers of Friend? ; for every Man I drank a Bottle with three or faur times, Seem’d to look pu ine in that light, but Some Aeeident qontinuaUy intervened tn break off theSe great Friendships^ Some,
I lost, by their being promoted ope Degree higher in the World than they ex-pe<^ed; others fell into an. AoKiuaintanee with tny Ford	or the Duke of —
and consequently fcorn’d to he Seen with any but good. Company: And a great her of my Qonqwiions I lost by their mar^ tying, on whieh they generally put on all the Ddgnityy Masters of FamiJi§ think pro^ per to invest thmfi.hei with, imagined that they had a Right to cwmand^ and astumed a ditstatorial Authority oiver all their ComparstQns.
Friends thus got, or thus lost, eould give me no great pain; but I foon fell into
300 LETTER XVI.
to an Acquaintance with Cyneas, who really gain’d my Esteem. His Conversation wds very agreable and lively; good SenSe and good Nature Seem’d to didfate every thing he Said; no overbearing Wit or inSo-lent displaying of his own Superiority was ever Seen in him. On thejcontrary, he adapted his Conversation to his Company, and Seem’d fond of letting down his own Parts, rather than difgust others, by shewing them their Inferiority.
H E was married to a Woman, whom he was very fond of. She had no glaring Charms, nor could she have been the Object of public Admiration; therefore his Love had ho Mixture of that Vanity, which gives a Man great Indulgence, when he fees his Wife admired, by reflecting, that others wish in vain for the charming Creature, who prefers him to all Mankind; and makes hini look on all his Guests, as if he had an Inclination to Say, She is mine, and I am pleafed to jind her judgment and my Charms have made me the Objedi pf Envy.
But
LETTER XVI. 301
But the Love of Cyneas took its riSe from a more generous Motive, namely, that of Gratitude to a Woman, who choSe him from amongst a number of Lovers, all ready to receive 300001. of which fhe was MistreSs; and her Behaviour to him after she was his Wife, was So faultlefs, that it was impoffible for Ill-nature itfelf, altho' it had been affisted by Eloquence, to cast any Blame on her Adfions. No falSe Delicacy animated her to be in continual PaS-fions, to prove she knew when her Servants had made any Mistake ; nor did any Vanity instruct her to make her Children troubleSome, by shewing whatever was hers had a Right to be So; but she bred them up in the manner she thought best for their real Good.
IN this reasonable well-order’d F'amily I Spent four Years very happily. Cyneas was my real Freind, and I never once had reaSon to find fault with him j but his Wife accidentally fell into an Acquaintance with Clarijfa^ a young Lady of lively Parts,

and whpSe Beauty was So striking, that if Whs impoffihlb not to acknowledge the Fd'rcfe of it. The innocent arid felaihelefs Attiiishffi^rif of this young Beauty was ho other, than that of exerting arid displaying the litmbst Fo#er of her Eyb§, to gain Frbfri tfery Wbriiari of her adquairitarice, especially if fhe Wa§ her ptofeifed the Hedft of the Mari, 6ri whorii heS whole tidppinefs deperided* Theft Whefi the Wo-mari grew jealous, arid the Husharid dr Lover becaftie tited of that JealoUiy ( which is always ifftputed to the Height of Ill-huftlduf, by a Mari who likes ariother better) the Edffhkfs ^6‘o‘ddMiKPd VUfiJd^ was Sdrry for the pbdr fbblifh Creature : ihe had drily a mirid tb ifiake herfelf a Uhle Spcft; arid, fbt her part Wbftdesed, how it was postible for any one to like the Wretch^ whorn Ihe had been thus fpending her time to allure &btti a Wbftiafi, who was unaffectedly -forid bf hifti.

Amongst the test, she cast het Eyes bn Cyhem. My Friend was pleafed With her Cortipany, and for Sostie tiiiie did nOt fofelfce the ConSequence. At last I observed he grew thoughtful and melancholy ; nothing in his HOufe collld pleash him ais ufiial: He cOUld not beat the Trouble of IShildrM : His Wife, who try’d eVety Way of obliging him, found it utterly imptatsti-Oable; for as the Caufe of his being diS-pleafed Was iii himfelf, she cbtild not remove it.
B Y this means this Moush, which tlSed to be the Scene of Contentment and i?iea-Sure, became all Confiifion and Oifc'drd. Cyneas'% Mind was fo formed, that he had many Struggles With himfelf, befbre he Would give Way tO So tinfeaSohable a Paf-fion, till he had really piqued Clafijjh; and froni her Uneafinefs oft that account she
began
304 LETTER XVl.
began to imagine She was in love with hinii The Moment he fancy’d her Love appa^ rent, So many Arguments preSented them-felves in favour of the young and beautiful Clarijfa, that he thought his Good-nature, G^nerofity, nay even his Gratitude, which was always his favourite Virtue, engaged him not to be cruel to her; who feemed not unwilling to facrifice even her darling Vanity on his account. He could not bear to condemn himfelf; and therefore fet his Imagination to work to justify what his Reafon must have condemned ; arguing thus with himfelf; “It is true I have great “ Obligations to my Wife; She loves me “ Sincerely, gave me her Fortune without “ any Referve ; but then, where could she “ have bestow’d it to have led a Life more “ to her own Defire} I have indulged her “ in every thing she could wish, her Sta-“ tion was rather advanced by this Mar-“ riage, and her Fame preServed : There-“ fore what she has done for me, falls in-“ finitely short oSC/<^r/^’s GoodneSs, who “ in the Bloom of Youth gives up even “ her Reputation, and facrifices her Virtue “ to my Love ; therefore she certainly en-

gages all my Gratitude and Affedlion.’’ When Cyneas’s Passion became once strong enough to make him thus endeavour by Fallacy to impoSe upon himSelfj he Soon vanquished all his Scruples, and abandoned himSelf to ClariJJd.^ Love. And she, on her Part, from imaginary Love; and real Vanity, perceived Such a Pleafure in finding no Man could from any Motive refist her Charms, that by degrees she was prevailed on to deny Cyneas nothing that was in her power to grant.
What follow’d is eafy to imagine j the Wife was miferable; Clarijfd.^ Pride would not bear a Rival, nor a ReSufal of any thing she afked j Fortune and Family appear’d Trifles to Cyneas^ in competition with his Gratitude to Clarijj'a : and I fin-eerely think, he almost prevailed upon himSelf to believe he could not in justice make her too great a Sacrifice; yet from Some Small Suspicion of my being So very unreajonable as to condemn his Condudt, he changed his Friendship into Hatred, and looked on me as his greatest Enemy.

bwh Power; and their Glaffes told them, Negledl was not likely to be their Fate.
Her Incapacity of any Relief made Cyneas quite regardlefs of his Behaviour to*^ wards her; and he was an Example, that what Men can do with Impunity, they execute with Intrepidity; in following their Own Inclinations.
Lavish in Expences on himfelf and the Woman he liked; he grew So parfimo-nious to the Woman who had generousty given every thing into his power, that he thought the Necefiaries of Life Extravagance for her; and wonder’d how fhe could be So unreasonable as to want the Smallest part of what he had a mind to fpend on another.
This tJfage, as it fell on a Perfon not vindidlive enough in her Nature to vent her Passions in any Signs of Rage, prey’d inwardly on herfelf, and in a Short tim« releafed her from her Mifery, and her barbarous Hushand from the Chain he So much long’d to break.

The great UneafineSs I felt, when I found my Self thus deceived in my good Opinion of a Man I had for four Years had the greatest Friendship for, I shall not attempt to defcribe, as your own Imagination will paint it in more lively Colours than Words can expreSs it.
I Was now as much at a lofs to find an Objedt of my Esteem, as at my first Acquaintance with Cyneas, with this melancholy Alteration, that my DeSpair was much greater. , Every Paffion implanted in us, for which we have no Gratification, is a Burden 3 and therefore we are very apt greedily to catch hold cf the first Fancy, that we are arrived at the right Door to unload ourSelves; hy which means we often mistake, and are forced to take up our Burdens again, and most times with Some additional Weight, that makes us repent iOf being fo hasty to lay them down.
T HI s I experienced Several times, in iosh the Men and Women whom I chpSe S3	to
310 LETTER XVI.
to like, or rather vrhom I accidentally met with, and I wished to esteem.
At last I fell into an Acquaintance with Phihtas, and he has been my Torment aL most ever fince. At first indeed he was all GoodneSs, and So agreeable, that I was entirely Satisfied in his Conversation, and thought my HappineSs compleat in his Friendship. But I have Several times, in the CourSe of our Acquaintance, wished he would by Some real Villany, give me an Opportunity of quite breaking with him; for he will neither adt enough like my Friend to give me the PleaSure which that Name infers, nor do any thing bad enough te justify me in renouncing him.
He Serves me as I have Seen a Lady treat her Squirrel. When the poor Creature, impatient of his Chains, jumps and tears about, till he has almost loofen’d one of the Links, and is ready to get free, the Mistrefs kindly takes him up in Such a manner, that the Chain is stackened, and he does not feel it^ and whilst she is stroaking him
with
LETTER XVI. 311
with Qne hand, with the other Slie rivets his Chain So fast, that it is impossible for him to §Scape.
Thus PhIhtm^ when he has psrovokel me to Such a degree that I can bear with hipa no longer, generally changes his Behaviour, and allures me back again. AU Qur Quarrels are about Trifies; for J eom^at*^ myfelf to the utmost of my power, apd confine my Uneafinefs, till Some unexpected Trifle (which is yet a Proof of his Neg-|eff) throws riie off my Guard, and makes me break out into Rage and Complaints to vent my Paffion: But I always get the worst of it; for, as I fee} much rnore for him thm he dqes for me, he is cool, whilst I am upon the rack. Lt the Hurry of my Mind, I forget all my real Gaufes of Complaint ; he loves to stwell on the Triste on which I first broke out : Aiid thus for the moment I am thrown in the wrong, even in any own Ppinioru
IN n® E n he always condefcends to foi*-give me, but will never conre to any-S 4	Eclair-
312 LETTER XVI.
Eclairclffement on the things he knows give me the most uneaSy SenSations, be» cauSe Truth does not pleaSe him ; and it is a Satisfadion of his Pride, to treat the Innocent as guilty.
When any Misfortune or Illnefs attends him, (as I am the only PerSon that truly loves him) he behaves So well, that I begin to argue away all his Faults, and See him in the most amiable Light imaginable. Then we agree in all qur Sentiments ; and as he has no Temptation to ad ill, my Love exerts itSelf without any Disappointment, and I am pleaSed if I can any way Serve him. I cannot upbraid him, be-cauSe I feel more for him than he does for himfelf.
The People who probe their Friends Wounds to the bottom, and pretend they do it only in hopes to cure them, 1 am afraid Seldom mtan any thing more than to give themSelves the pleafure to keep up in their Minds the Idea of their own Superiority.
Th u s
letter XVI.
313
Thus either his Misfortunes or Behaviour keeps me in continual Affliction and Perturbation of Mind. When I am in Good-humour with him, I fancy every Indifcretion and Careleffnefs he is guilty of, ariSes from his being above the Dread which often makes Mankind cautious ; namely, that of being fufpected or found out to be Fools : Nay, when he has no Temptation to PleaSure, nor Opportunity of exerting his Pride, he behaves fo well, that I deceive myfelf fo far, as to begin to contemplate the great Enjoyments to be found in Friendship.
I Think like Montaign, the Receiver of the Benefit is the Man that obliges his Friend, and have no Idea of any Acknowledgment of an Obligation, or any Thanks from my dear Philotas: And indeed, the moment he has recover’d his Health, or got rid of his tJneafineSs, he proves him-felf, in thofe two Points only, the truest Friend ever any Man had; for he does not take any pains to avoid giving me Opportunities of being uSeful to him, and utterly
loSes
314 L E T T E R XVI.
loSes the Remembrance of all Obligations between us. Then Some of his Companions, whom not a Week befqre he had expreffed a Contempt of to me, for not coming near him when he was top ill to anaufe them, grow very fond of him, (hare and flatter him in his PleaSures; and I am the only Enemy he has.
H E uSes every one well but me: I fup-pofe beeaufe I am the only Perfon his Pfitfe takes umbrage at ^ as it may give him a hint, that I alone have caufe (though I never put it in practice) to upbraid him. Nay, his Behaviour to all around him, be-lides mySelf, has Something in it So great and noble, that I cannot gpt a hearty Contempt for him: This pierces me tp the Soul,
thus mblameahk to all hejid^s.

I do nothing but perplex mySelf to find out the Reafon why this fhould be 5 and indeed I find it the greatest Difiicctty in the world to reconcile Some Parts oS his behaviour with others. But I verily believe, that as it has been always my strongest Inclination ever fince I knew him,, to watch and act what best would pleafehina, provided it would do him no Injury, that he looks upon me as a Creature made pur-pofely for him, and expects So much, that when I refuSe to comply with any thing, though it be ever So unreasonable or hurtful to himSelf, his Pride steps in, and he looks upon a Contradiction to his Will, from one he imagines his Slave, as the greatest Proof of being his Enemy* In short, he works my Pastions Sometimes to SoftneSs, other times to Rage, and I may Say almost to MadneSs 3 though that Rage and MadneSs never vents itSelS on him, but preys on my own Mind, and takes from me all my Peace, I have at times almost got th? better of my Affecti^ fcr him 3

IT H A N K you Sor making that uSe of me, in which confists my chief Pleasure, namdy, that of any way afiisting to alleviate the Sorrows of my Fellow-^Creatures; and, if at the Conclufion of your Letter, I had found any Account of your own HappineSs, the History of your Life would have been a very great Entertainment to me; for, as by Such Histories I get the Knowledge of Mens different Senfations on every occafion, I had much rather be let into the various Labyrinths of their Minds, than read Volumes stuffed with the Chaos of Matters of Fad:> where Charaders are undistinguistiable,
\
LETTER XVII. 319
undistinguisshable, and it Seems to be regarded as a thing of greater GoaSequenee where Men were born, or where they died, than What they did, or how they acted.
ICoNCElvfeDa great Esteem for you from the moment you told me, that you Was always Satisfied with what Fortune your Father had left you, without letting either Ambition or Avarice enter into your Mind; and purfued that much more noble and Satisfactory Pleafure, which true Friendship gives. This Esteem really interested me in every Scene of your Life, and I Sympathized with you in all your Griefs and all pmt PleaSures.
Your Acquaintance with Cyneas, and 3teur Delcription of his manner of living with his Wife, inSpired me with Joy, and I Was in great hopes, that then you had met with your utmost Wish. But how great was my Disappointment, when Ckt^ rijfa, whoSe Out-fide alone is beautiful, came and overturned the Peace of a whole Family at €mce. What could inSpire her
with
320 L fe T T E R XVII.
with Such wanton Cruelty; and what Tortures must the poor Wife of Cyneas feel in a lingering Death cauSed by no other Distemper, than a Perturbation of Mind, arifing from the Ingratitude and barbarous Treatment of the Man, in whoSe Love She had fondly placed all her HappineSs, and where all her TenderneSs was center’d No doubt> her Memory dontinilally placed his former Behaviour before her Eyes • and the Comparison between that, and what she then shffered, was too dreadful to bear, and live 5 and therefore, no wonder she funk under its Weight.
I Am So affedted with her Story, that I find it difficult to quit the Subjedt; and would rather go a thouSand Miles, than Suffer the Misfortune of meeting with Cia~ rijfa^ or her cruel Hushand; tho’ from the account you give of him at first, I am greatly shocked at the Confideration, that I may daily unknowingly converfe with Such Wretches.
Undoubtedly you did extremely right, never to have any ConverSe with
Cyneas^
letter XVII. 321
Cyneas., from the moment all hopes were ost of making yourSelf Serviceable to his poor unhappy Wife, whoSe Fate will always bring Tears into my Eyes, when any Accident brings her to my Remembrance.
PHIL OIL A iS’s Character is fo odd a Medky, that I really don’t know what to make of it; and is a Proof of the strange CapriciouSneSs and Variety of Paffions Mankind are endued with. I am far from blaming your Conduct; for, if I had been So unhappy as to have met with him in my own Purfuit of a Ffiend, I dare believe, I should have acted the Same Part.
His Faults Seem to ariSe fo entirely from CareleffneSs and want of Thought, that I should have found it very difficiilt to have broke from him; and befides, shy Some Hints in your Letter, it appears to me, his wrong Behaviour towards you often ariSes from SuSpicion: for, being of an impatient Temper, when you contradict him, he Sufpects you are alter’d in your Affection; and Anger on that account, VoL. L	T	often
322 LETTER XVII.
often takes its rife ftom TenderneSs; tho Undoubtedly you always mean his real Good.
I H A V E a great Compaftion for whatever you feel; and wish it was in my power to give you any Advice that might be Serviceable. But to adviSe a Man to act againft a strong Bent of his own Nature, I am Senfible, would he to no manner of purpoSe; and you yourSelf must be the best Judge, Whesher, if you had quite given up your Friend, you should not be more miserable than at preSent.
A s I should be extremely glad to a-muSe you with any thing agreeable, I will relate a Story, which, as it gave me great PleaSure, will, I hope, have the Same Effect on you.
There lived fome time ago in Tork-> Jhire.^ two young Ladies, Harriot and Prif-cilla. They were Coufin-Germans; and, as Prifdlla lost her Father and Mother in her Infancy, her Uncle took the Care of her, and bred her up with his Daughter
Harriot,
letter XVII. 32^
Harriot. The Sympathy of theSe two young Creatures Minds was So great, that they immediately grew fond of each other; and, instead of quarrelling and fighting for the best Play-thing, their only DiSpute arofe from the Fear each of them feltj lest her Companion Should have any thing worfe than stie herfelf had. Thus they fpent all their Youth in Tranquillity and Peace; and their strid Friendshipj and continually being together, appeared the greatest Pleafure, that even their Imagina* tion could form.
When Harriot was Twenty Years of Age, and Prifcilla Eighteen; Publius^ a young Gentleman, a distant Relation of theirs, accidentally came into that Country. The good old Gentleman, Harriot*s Fa^ ther, (who was famous for his HoSpitality) invited him to his HouSe.
This additional Companion Was an additional Pleafure to the two Ladies; and, as Publius was Very gallant and well-bred, their Conversation was lively, innocent, and agreeable; but in a short time Gravity T 2	Succeeded
324 LETTER XVII.
Succeeded ChearfulneSs, and all their Meetings were uneaSy, reffrainbd, and melancholy.
IIAR RIOT and PrifcUla continued the Sym{)athy of their Tempers, and neither of them costld refist the Force of PubluV% Charms and ComplaiSance. They adted as Friends should do, and confessed to each other the whole Truth, as Soon as they knew it themfelves.
G R E A T as their DistreSs was, they found Some fort of Refuge from it in their own GoodneSs, and artleSs Sincerity; and agreed, that, if the Objedf of their Love should ferioussy make choice of either of them, the other should give him up, and form no Defign to interrupt her Rival’s Happinefs*
Many were the Hours they talked on this Subjedt; fot indeed they could never fix on any other: and for Some time Pud-Urn carried it So even between them, that they could not find out which he liked best ; till at last he So vifibly distinguished V v: ’	Harriot,
• L E T T E R XVII. 325
Harrioty and was So peculiarly affiduous to pleaSe her, that PrifcillawdiS convinced his Choice was fixed. $he kept up strictly to her Agreement with her Friend, and never So much as thought of any underhand Plot, to Supplant her in her Lover’s Affection. Harriot, on her fide, lost almost all the PleaSure arifing from mutual Love, by the Confideration of what her dear Coufin must Suffer.
PRISCILLA, whatever she felt, concealed it as much as possible, and ge-neroussy argued with IIarrlat, that there was no manner of reaSon for her foregoing her own HappineSs, whilst she could never be the better for it; that Publius had a right to chuSe, and, in asserting that Right, he had been guilty of no Fault, or Treachery to any one: that Taste is involuntary, and not to be controuled; nor did she think, she had any CauSe to be angry with Publius, for not liking her; at least not So much caufe, as he would have had to be diSpleaSed with the Woman, who, to Satisfy her own Whims, would willingly be the Bar to his HappineSs.
T 3	In
326 LETTER XVII.
In Short,	Inclination, Publius*^
Importunity, the Father’s ConSent, and Prifcilk's Generofity Soon brought about the Match,
Two Days afterwards, Prifcilla was miffing, and no where to be found. Har- ^ riofs Grief was inexpreffible ; but whilst ’ She was lamenting herfelf, and bewailing her Mifery, a Letter was brought her by a Messenger, who, the moment he had deliver’d it into her own Hand, left the HouSc, and would not tell whence it came. It was from Prifcilla, and contained thefe Words;
“ Love, and not Hatred, istheCaufc of my Absence: perhaps I could not command mySelf enough, to prevent a Melancholy’s overspreading me, which might cast a Gloom over all your Hap-pinefs. Don’t enquire where I am gone ; for I have taken effedlual Methods, that you shall never find it out: When I can perfedfly conquer this unreasonable
Passion,
LETTER XVII. 327
" Paflion, you fhall See me again j till “ when,
I am. Tour Jincere,
And affedUonate Friend,
PRISCILLA.
Thus this young Woman of eighteen Years of Age, from the Force of a fix’d and strong Friendship, had power enough over herSelf to act reaSonably, in oppofi-tion to the most violent Paffion imaginable 5 for this she confefles, by quitting the Houfe, and finding that nothing but AbSence could . cure her.
Now, to conclude my Story, in two Years Prifcilia return’d : Time had calm’d her Mind, and she Spent the Remainder of her Life (for she would never hear of marrying) with her dear Harriat, and lest, at her Death, all she was worth to her Children.
PUB L lUS was entirely ignorant of her having any other Love for him, than T 4	what
328 LETTER XVII.
what aroSe from his proving a good HuS-band to her Friend ; and always treated her with the utmost ReSpedt and Good-manners.
IF this Story can amufe you as well as it did me, my Defign in telling it, will be fully anSwered; for nothing can give me an equal PleaSure, with hearing any noble or generous Adtions of any of my Fellow-Creatures ; and your Ideas of Friendship feem fo like mj own, that I cannot help fancying, there is a great Sympathy between us.

London.
SIR,	[From Exeter.
AS we agreed to write only, when we had an Inclination, I fhall make no ExcuSe for my long Silence. Indeed, the very Thoughts of making an ExcuSe to fuch a Friend as you are, would be a Crime, as it would carry with it a Suppo-fition, that you could let a low Suspicion of your Friend have a place in your Mind.
Last Night I Spent the Evening with a Set of Gentlemen, to whom I was introduced by an Acquaintance I have been very intimate with, ever fince my Arrival here. It did not appear to me, that any of the Company were very remarkable for Understanding j
330 LETTER XVIII.
Understanding; but, as they at first Seem’d inclined to pleaSe each other, and agreed in Mirth and Humour, I was very well Satisfied with their Conversation, till at last they accidentally fell into a DiScourSe on Mr. yohnfon. I have very little Knowledge of him mySelf, but have been told by Several of his Acquaintance, that he is a very good-natured Man; and one strong Proof, that there is no Truth in that Observation, that Wit and Good-nature do not inhabit the fame Minds.
However, the moment he was mentioned, he was abufed in a manner I Should have thought cruel to any Man who was not the greatest Villain in the World ; but all in general Terms; for I could not find there was any particular Crime laid to his^charge: nay, one Gentleman told a Story of hirn, very much to his advantage, only he thought fit to introduce, and conclude it with an Affirmation, that he did not believe it; in which Incredulity all the Company, but my Friend and mySelf, heartily con-curr’d. I could not help thinking, that this Willingness to dishelieve any Stories
to
LETTER XVIIL
331
to a Man’s advantage, and at the Same time abufing him, without afiigning any CauSe, must be owing to Some shocking Malignity in Nature. At last the great Crime he was guilty of, came out; for it was Said by one 6f his AbuSers, with a melancholy Countenance and a forfowful Shake of the Head, that Mr, Johnfon ct^^ tainly had a great deal of Wit ; it was pity fo much was thrown away on fuch a Man: ay. Said three or four of the rest all at once, he has Wit^ that’s true; but it would be much better for him, if he had leSs Wit and more Judgment,
From this time forward, there was nothing to be heard, but the words Wit^ Judgment^ Underjianding, Senfe, Apprehen^ Jion, &c. which Words were immediately refounded in my Ears, and I could not find put for a great while, what they were aiming at; sho’ in reality they Seem’d engaged in an Emulation, which should vent most Nonfenfe about Understanding.
I Asked my Friend this Morning how lie could keep fuch Company j when he
anfwered.
332 LETTER XVIII.
aniwered, “ That he went very Seldom “ amongst thern, and only carried me thi-“ ther, to make an Experiment, whethei" ‘‘ I, who knew nothing of them^ could “ find them put; but, continued he, they “ Spend every Evening together in the Same “ rnanner, and are happy all the Morning ‘‘ in.theThoughts how they have stiined the - the Night before. Mr. Johrifon “ and laughs at them; for there’s nothing fo mean, that they won’t condefcend to, " in order to get into his Company, when “ they pick up every Word he fays, as " far as their Memories will Serve them, to Set up for Wits with, and at the fame time abuSe him for having that Wit, “ they are fo glad to make uSe of.”

LETTER XIX.
Theodosius to Ferdinand at Exeter.
SIR,	[From London.
1 THANK you Sor your Letter, and am not at all Surprized at the Scene you met with about Mr. Johnfon-, for nothing is So much the Obje<st of Envy, and consequently of Spite and Ill-nature, as Wit. There are numbers of Men who may properly be call’d Fhe Puller^•down; for ds they find an Impossibility to raiSe them-felves, they fancy this pulling others down will make them equal with them.
I Dined yesterday with the famous 'Mx, Freeman. I am apt to be Somewhat reshrved, till I know my Company; and
his
334 letter XVIII.
his great Reputation for Wit and HumouS made me at first very backward: But his Behaviour was Such, that it was impostible to be long in his Company, Without becoming eaSy, and well-acquainted with him. Instead of endeavouring to exert any Superiority, his Understanding stowed from his Lips, without appearing to be at all in his Thoughts. He attacked nobody by way of Raillery; unleSs they began with him; and then with great Good-humour took every Joke that was given him. And indeed he was not fpared; for the whole Table Seemed to be met with a ReSolution to fall upon him, and pull him down. No Jest could be too coarSe to paSs for Wit, provided it was but levelled at Mr. Freeman, Some fort of Caution appeared for a little while; but when by his own CondeScenfion they found he would not bite hard, they threw off all ReServe, and regarded not what they Said. The whole Scene put me in mind of Efip's Fable of the Frogs and King Log. TheSe infignificant Fellows, like the Frogs, at first were afraid; and this Fear kept them in awe, till by degrees they found there was no danger: and then
nothing
LETTER XVIII. 335
nothing would Serve them, but getting up and riding upon their King: And the Dread, once taken off, turned as uSual into InSo-lence and Tumult,
Mr. Freeman undoubtedly has SenSe enough to know, that by treating theSe Sort of Men with more Contempt, he might meet with more ReSpect from them: But then, as it is the Bent of his Nature to be open and free, he must lay a Constraint upon himfelf; which, in my opinion, is paying greatly too dear for the ReSpect of Fooh., whoSe Minds are actuated by nothing but Envy.
Mr. Freeman^ tired no doubt with the NonSenfe he was Surrounded with, left us foon after Dinner. The moment he was gone out of the room, the whole Company together Seemed to strive which should fay most of fuch new Sentences as thefe j namely, that common Senfe is the moji un^ common thing in the World; that fome Feo-pie have all Senfe but commmon Senfe, &c. &c. And then concluded with a compajfionate Sigh for poor Mr. Freeman, that he had
no
336 LETTER XIX.
not as much Judgment as Wit; which to prove, they dwelt strongly on every trifling Indiscretion that even common Fame had ever reported him to have been guilty of: and all the Comfort they could find to alleviate their great Grief for his Misfortunes was, that it is the common Lot of all Men of great Parts to want Judgment, I could not help faying, that I thought he talked very clearly on every Subject, and that I could not fee in what Point he was So very defective in Judgment. On which was immediately Set up a loud contemptuous Laugh, at my great Folly, in not Seeing that his Wit itfelf was a strong Proof he could have no other Faculty of the Mind.
When I left this delightful Society, I could not forbear reflecting on the great Mifchief the Dread of having a lefs Understanding than our Neighbours, brings on Mankind. Hence it comes, that every Man of Senfe is the Object of the Envy, and consequently of the Hatred of Some fnoIl Part of his Acquaintance. And hence, I think, certainly arofe at first, the Saying, Hhat Wit and Judgment are never Com-
panions;
LETTER XIX. 337
panions : whereas they are really very good Friends, notwithstanding the Malice of thoSe who report them to be always at variance, For proof of my Assertion, let any one afk a Man of real Wit his Opinion of any thing, when his own Passions are not at all concerned; and See if he is not more judicious than the Man of Prudence only, who indeed never stumbles, but then it is only becauSe he never steps out of the beaten Path; and even there, keeps his Eyes continually fixed on the Ground.
I Think Men argue on this Head, if possible, more unfairly than on any other. For the true CauSe why Men of Parts are ever guilty of any IndiScretions, is, that the Passions are always strong in proportion to the Understanding; and there is a Part of the human Mind, very little obServed, which never fails its attendance on the Man of SenSe ; namely, the Imagination. This, in conjundfion with the Passions, I do confefs, makes strange havock with the Judgment; but for that Reafon to conclude, that Such a one has no Judgment, is just as abSurd
it would be, if a Man took a fancy to endeavour to feed himSelf with his Feet, VoL. L	U
338 LETTER XlX.
to affert that he had therefore no Hamfs, even though it was very viSible that he Sometimes nSed his Hands to affist him in his preposterous Attempt. I arn very well convinced by Experience, (fori have watch’d all the Men of Parts of my Acquaintance very narrowly for that PurpoSe) that Wif-dom. Understanding, Comprehenfion, Ap-prehenfion, Senfe, Parts, Wit, with any other Names that Man may have invented, go hand in hand, and inhabit the fame Minds. But here by Wit I would be understood to mean true Wit; namely, a Capacity of comprehending various Ideas, and a Power of joining them properly together; And if this definition be true, what is that Power but Judgment itfelf.? For I will not, from what I have here Said, be anfwerable for that Race of Men, who adluated by Envy, and Spurred on by Ill-nature, poffeSs a Power of railing Hatfe-Iaughs and loud Ap-plauSes from the Malicious, by Setting the Defeds of others in what they call a ridiculous light.
Perhaps you will think me arrogant, in contradiding the many great Men who have wrote on this Subjed, and are of a
contrary
letter XIX. 339
contrary Opinion. But this ReaSon will hold in all CaSes, to Shut up all Inquiries whatsoever, and make us implicitly Submit to the Opinion oS the first Man of SenSe whom we read on any Subjedl. The Man who, I think, gives the clearest Definition of Wit and Judgment, by that very Definition proves they do go together; and yet allows that they may not. The Reafon of this to me is very clear; for as his Inquiries into the Labyrinths of the human Mind, are very Subtle and fine, he thought Wit, as the Word is generally uSed, too light a thing to be admitted as a Part of his own Composition ; and therefore would not believe, that what he thought he had not, was an inseparable Companion of Judgment. But as I am very Sure, that according to his own Idea of it, I can in Several Places convidt him of having a great deal of Wit, it is not improbable but upon Such a Refiedlion hs might have alteT’d his Opinion.
Another Reafon for the Outcry about the Indiscretions of Men of Parts is, that the People who make the Outcry generally judge wrong of what is diScreet, as in thS Example before related of Mr. FtAemaif^ U 2	letting
,340 LETTER XIX.
letting Fools make a King Log of him. Now a Man whoSe Understanding was two Degrees above theSe Fellows, and ten Degrees lower than Mr. Freemaif^, by an affeded Dignity in his Behaviour, would keep them at a distance, and at the Same time exult in his own Superiority over Mr. Freeman in that Point: But he could not See Sar enough to know, that it must be granted first, that the ReSped of theSe Men is necessSary to Mr. Freeman'^ HappineSs, before it can be allow’d that it is any IndiScretion in him, not to take pains to come at it. The old French Proverb, that le Jeu ne 'uaut fas la Chandelky is very apt to run much in the Heads of Men of SenSe; whereas the very understanding it in its full Latitude, is beyond the Capacities of others.
Another fallacious Invention that kride has thought proper to adopt as a Reality, is, that it is postible to have Ideas, and yet not be able to expreSs them. One stiould think the weakest Eyes might fee through Such a glaring AbSurdity ; and yet fuch is the Force of a strong Defire to be thought wife, that I have more than once
heard
LETTER XIX. 341
heard it afferted by Men, who did not deed exprefs many Ideas.
MON TA IG NE Says, this is a mete Shift, and quotes Horace^ Seneca and Cicero in Support of his Opinion. A Man may undoubtedly have a faint Notion, an iiu-perfedl Image and Conception, (according to the above-mention’d Author) that he knows not what to make oi within, and consequently cannot bring out j but to fay, he has a clear distindf Idea of any thing which he cannot convey to another who has a Capacity to receive it, is fuch Nonfenfe that if the Affertors of it were not as void of all Senfations, as they are of Ideas, they could not poffibly Speak it without a Blulln
If indeed any one is conshioiis that he lives in a World by himSelf, that whatever he fays to the rest of Mankind, is like talking to an Infant just born: I will allow in that Cafe, that he cannot convey his Ideas to others; but the Reafon is plain, it is becaufe they cannot receive them; and not becaufe he cannot exprefs them. The Intervention of any Passion, as Pride, Fear, may take away a Man’s Utterance for-U 3	the
342 LETTER XIX.
the preSent; but I only Speak what may be done, when the Mind is free from Perturbation, and has full Power to exert itSelf.
Another Fallacy taken hold of^ in order to Support Mens darling PleaSure of imagining they have Some Branch of Under-ffanding Superior to that of their Neighbours, is that common Saying, that fuch a Man has indeed great Parts, but he knows nothing of the World. Now this Knowledge is generally confined by every Man to the Knowledge of that Society of which he is a Member. He knows most of that, and consequently that is most neceffary to be. known, in order to prove an Understanding, which is the Point in view. And this Humour is carried So far amongst Mankind, that I adtually knew a poor old Woman, who lived to the Age of Fourfeore in one Parish, who thought all Ignorance confisted in not Icnowing the Manner of living, and the Ways of that Parifli, which she did the Honour to inhabit.
The Several Customs and Ceremonies by whigh the different Claffea of Men regulate
LETTER XIX. 343
gulate their outward Behaviour to one another, is a thing ealily learn’d, if attended to, and always known by Men of Senfe, as far as is necessary, although they may not always comply with thoSe Cuftoms; becauSe if they contradict tlieir own Humour, they Sometimes will not give that up to any Ceremony whatever. But if by the Knowledge of the Woidd is meant the diving into the fecret Motives of Mens Actions, and the being acquainted with the deepest Labyrinths of the human Mind, this certainly may as well be learn’d amongst one Clafs of Men as another. One should think, if any thing could be allow’d as a Proof of Understanding, the unraveling this most difficult and knotty Point, would be allow’d fo; yet to show what Shifts Men will make to evade Such a Concession in another’s favour, I remember that I was once in company with a Gentleman, when the DiScourSe fell upon the human PaS-fions, who talked So clearly even on that intricate Subject, that he proved, as far as the Nature of the thing v/ould bear a Prooh every Sentiment he uttered. I was vastly pleafed wdth him, but greatly Surprized fo U 4	hear^
344 letter XIX.
hear, the moment he left us, all the Company expreSs their Concern, that notwithstanding all he had Said, he was a very Jilly Fellow., and knew nothing of the World. I stared, and aSked them what they meant; and was presently inSormed, that he did indeed know Generals., as was plain by his DiScourSe, but that he was totally ignorant as to /«-dhviduals. (This by the by is no greater an Absurdity than to Say, the Greater does not contain the Lester.) On which every Man in the Room told Some Story of this poor Gentleman^s being impofed on by the Treachery of others, wshere indeed he had no reafon to fuSpe(st their Destgn of deceiving him : but yet this, before fuch Judges, was eafily admitted as a Proof of his Ignorance and Folly. I told them, I thought there might be other Reafons for his being impofed on, befides Folly; for that as I looked on it to be postible that fome human Creatures might have Hearts; perhaps this Gentleman’s Love to particular Men might prevent his feeing So clearly into their Characters, as his Head would enable him to do ; and no doubt the Intervention of any Pastion must blind the Judgment j
and
LETTER XIX.
345
and in that CaSe it was his Heart, and not his Head, that was impoScd on. And as to the Charaders of other particular Men, if he was ignorant of them, very likely he had never attended at all to them; but to fay therefore he could not come at the Knowledge of them by Study, fuppofing him unprepoffeffed with any Pafiion, was as unfair as it would be to fay, becauSe a Man did not chuSe to dig in a Dunghil, he could not therefore handle a Spade. They either could not, or would not anfwer me j but still concluded, that the Gentleman was a very Jilly Fellow, and very ignorant of the World; which they all affirmed with a great Oath, or a JigniJicant Gejiure and a loud Rap on the Table. TheSe Arguments were not to be contradicted, and consequently I was not mad enough to attempt the anSwering of them. But to go through, or but to mention all the Evafions, Shifts, and Inventions Men find out to Satisfy themstlves that they poffeSs Sornething Superior to their Neighbours, would be an endleSs Talk ; a Labour like that of HerculeSy in cutting off the Hydra's Head; for as fast as one is destroyed, another appears. In short, Mankind,
346 L E T T E R XIX.
kind aD: about the Faculties of the Mind as Children do in their Scrambles for Playthings : throw any thing amongst a Set of little Masters and Mififes, Such as a Doll, &c. that they think valuable, and all but the happy Child that gains the Vidfory in the Scuffle cry and roar, and are diffatiS-fied, till Mamma or NurSe appeaSes them, by cutting out Paper-Dolls and tnimick Play-things, which they affure them are full as good as the other. TheSe they are fain to take up with ; and all agree to inSult the before-envied Child, by affuring it, that what Mamma or NurSe has given them, is much better than what they had Scrambled for. So far no Mifchief is done, and the little Masters and Miffes are all contented. But the misfortune is, that it’s ten to one but the next Company that comes in, takes notice of the fine-jointed, well-dreffed Doll, and calls to that Child who holds it. Then returns the Envy into the little proud Hearts of all the rest, and they take every Opportunity of Spiting, vexing, and teaSing the Object of their Hatrecl. Thus when a Man runs on a dull Harangue of an Hour, filled with trite Sentiments,
which
LETTER XIX. 34.7 which he thinks WiSdom, and at the Same time affefts to deSpiSe the Man whoSe chearful Wit enlivens all his Companions, what is this but hugging the Paper-Doll ? Or when another, who is inSenfible of all PleaSure, and entirely void of every Taste but that of a vain Reputation of what he thinks Some Branch of Understanding, makes it the BufineSs of his Life to Set up an Outcry at every IndiScretion committed by a Man of Parts; does not the Paper-Doll again prefent itSelf to our Thoughts ? And do we not plainly fee, that while, like the Children, he cries, " Ay, Master, I don’t care, mine is better than yours,” he would give his Ears to come at the othen I am Sure I love indulging all forts of Children, as well thoSe who by their Size are vifibly So, as thofe who by their Stature at first fight appear to be Men and Women, too well to wish to take from them any of their Pleafures : Only out of love to them, I would wish the pretty Dears to be contented, and not fume, fret, and gnaw them-felves with Envy; which, befides that it is the worst thing in the world for their Healths, may happen to be discovered even
to
348 LETTER XIX.
to the PcrSons they hate. And then indeed it will make them very contemptible. And if Severity to any fort of Children is ever justifiable, it is certainly So on this account.
I M A Y be thought very unreasonable, to defire Mankind to fit down contented with the different Degrees of Understanding Nature has endued them with, and not vex themfelves to no purpofe, becaufe they have not more. But if this thing was ferioufiy confidered, perhaps it may not be So very unreasonable a Request as it appears by only a tranfient View; for, to comfort Men, and encourage them not to be So very angry, if they are not at the very Top in this Point, let it be remem-bred ;
i7?. That there is no Advantage of Nature, that is not attended with a Disadvantage ; for, as I before observed, that the Passions are strong, in proportion to the Understanding, and as there is So little Food for our Passions, and So many ways of difappointing us in any PurSuit, in that
reSpedt,
LETTER XIX. 349 teSpect, I believe, we shall not find the Balance in favour of the Understanding: and as to the Gratification of any Appetites, I believe it will be allowed, that the being ever So filly will be no Hindrance to it.
2^^, I F worldly Interest be thought valuable, I look upon it to be most likely to be attained by Men not remarkable for their Parts; for they are constantly endued with Cunning; the true Definition of wlych I take to be, a Capacity of at^ tending to Trifles, and an Art of impofing on others.
That filly Men may be posseffed of the former, cannot be denied; and that they have the latter, I think will bear very little Dilpute : for, as the Art of impofing on others, confists intirely in being able to put on what Chara<ster you pleaSe ; and, as Men of SenSe have almost always strong Characteristics of their own, they cannot So well appear in any borrowed Shape, as the Man, who has nothing to hinder his assuming whatever Form he
thinks

thinks for his purpoSe: For it is much eafier to write legibly on a blank Sheet of Paper, than on one already So filled, that it requires the double Pains of crazing the Impreffions made there, before you can write any thing new; a Labour that nothing in this World is worth : So that Men of Parts, from the Strength of their Imaginations and Passions, do generally appear in their natural Character, which is what I call Simplicity, and is directly oppofite to Cunning; but if, as I fufpect. Men mean Cunning, when they talk of Judgment, I will readily grant, that the dullest Men have most of it.
Another Disadvantage Men of Parts lie under, is, that altho’ they are very ready to do friendly Offices to, and forgive Fools their Folly, yet Fools will never forgive them their SenSe. And, as their Numbers are greater, they have it Sometimes in their power to do the otiiers essential MiSchiefs. But, if after all that can be Said, Men will be So childish as to hug a Paper-Doll, and fancy it a fine Piece of Clock-Work, or to stretch their Necks, continually ready to break

them, in a vain Hope of making them* Selves taller than they are, whilst the Hurt is confined to themSelves, they ought to be forgiven; but if, from finding the Impofli* bility of making themSelves taller, they flily endeavour to cut off others Heads or Legs, in order to reduce them to their own Size; I wish there could be Some Punishment found out to teach them, that, if they would but take half the pains to come at the only thing truly valuable, namely,Good-neSs, and a Love of the Society they are Members of, they might attain real Hap-pineSs.
But if I cannot perSuade any of my Fellow-Creatures to be of my Opinion, I am convinced, if I was to publish my Thoughts to all the World, I should be forgiven. I might mount the Rojira, and with a little Alteration, uSe the Words Shakefpear makes Brutus Speak to the Romans : I might with Impunity addreSs Mankind in this manner:
TVHO's here fo bafe, to own himfelf a Foolf If any fpeak; for him have I offended.

Who is here fo rude, as to think lowly of himSelfIf any fpeak; for him have I of-fended. Who is here fo vile, to place himSelf in the common Herd? If any fpeak; for him have I offended.
Then I might pauSe Sor a Reply; and dare venture to affirm, I should be unanimousty anSwered :
“ Non^, Brutus, none.
The Conclufion plainly follows;
‘‘ Then none have I offended.
I Will tire you no longer with my Fancies, but conclude mySelf,

2 LETTER XX.
M Y Journey was very dull; for, altha' the Coach was full, I found it very difficult to make the least Entertainment out of any of the Company. We were all Men, which made me hope, we should Soon become acquainted: So indeed we did, and too much So j for I found every one of them without any Ceremony gave way to the natural Bent of his own DiSpo-iition, without any Confideration for any thing but himSelf. One was an Objedtion-Maker (a Character, I dare Say, you are no Stranger to.) It was impoffible to propofe any thing he had not Something to Say a-gainst; and all his Fright Seemed to be, that any thing he had not first thought on, should be right. Another was So tenacious of his own Humour, that he could not bear the least Contradiction, and keep his Temper. You may be Sure tbeSe two a-gteed extremely, at least if Noife and wrangling about nothing can be called agreeing.
W e dropped the latter at the End of the Second Day’s Journey; and then she Objection-Maker, if niobody elSe happened to
form
LETTER XX. 3
form any Scheme, or make any PropoSal, would do it himSelS one minute, and eon^ tradidt it the next, rather than not keep his favourite Talent in play. I was Sometimes diverted with the OddneSs of his Hu^ mour, but could not help restedting, if he had any Fanjily, what a Life they must lead; for, without his appearing to command, they can never follow the most innocent Inclination in peace.
A Third of my Gentlemen was fo delicate, he could meet with nothing upon the Road to pleaSe him: Inns were Such' horrid Places, it was impostible to bear the Inconveniencies of them. At every Meal we were stunned with his fwearing, and finding fault with all the Servants, and fretting, becauSe he could meet with thing nice enough to fatisfy his Hunger; and all the way in the Coach, we were entertained with the BadneSs of what we had already met with, and PropoSals of what we should have next, eternally con-tradidled by the abovemention’d. Gentleman 5 tho’ by the way he was very indifferent as to himSelf, what he eat or drank.

^ LETTER XX.
The Epicures Family, you may be Sure,, enjoy Meals quieL and fleafant enough to help Digejiion,
The Fourth took it into his head to govern the Stage-Coachman; and, as that is generally a pretty hard Talk, he took care to quarrel with him at every Place we arrived at; and then fell into Paflions with us in the Coach, becauSe we would not all do the Same thing; and inSisted ' that we Should give him nothing. But the Objedlion-Maker Swore, if he perfisted in fuch Folly, he alone would give him double as much as he ufed to have from the whole Coach. The governing Gentleman must be- a delightful Master of a Family, undoubtedly vastly belovedf and not at all feared.
The fifth Traveller Said nothing the whole way, but yes, or no: but lest he should have no Share in making the Noife^ he voluntarily hum’d a Song in a diSagree-able Voice from Morning till Night, whilst every now and then the Objection-Maker peevishly delired him to be quiet; which
had

had no other Effect, than to make him fing Something the louder; as much as to fay; “ If I take a Place in a,Stage-Coach,
and pay for it, I have a right to do what “ I pleaSe in it.’*
You may be shre, thefe were aill very agreeable Coin panions to me, who have always laid it down as a Maxim and Rule for the Conduct of my Life, to take every thing as I meet with it, and make the best of whatever I cannot remedy. And there Is hardly any of the common Occurrences in Life, but what are very fupportable, and often might be made even pleafant, if not loaded with Incojiveniencies, by the Folly of thoSe, who, by fretting and fuming, provoke and infiame ,a finall Scratch into a painfiil Wound. However, I thank God, 1 am in yery good Health, and rid of my troubleSome Company, (for, by being confined to them So long, they grew very much So,) and at liberty to leave what is disagreeable to me whenever I pleaSe.

fingle Man ; So we had no Ladies with us 5 and the Conversation turned mostly on Learning. After we had run through a Criticism on the Surface of all the best Authors amongst the Clastics, it was Natural for Shakefpear not to eScape coming under our Observation. The Play that was chiefly talked on, Was King Lear. You know I am So great an Admirer of that Play, I cannot help being pleafed whenever it is mentioned ; as I think it is impossible ever to read or conssder of it, without finding new Beauties unobServed before. I hoped to hear Something new or^j^ that Head, therefore hearkened at first with the stridest Attention; but I Soon perceived the Cha-ratsters, the Moral, the nice Touches of the Passions, were not the Points to be confidered ; but in their stead, the’finding out the Meaning of Some obfolete Words, and obScure Expressions made uSe of by Ed--gar, when he was perSonating a Madman, and by the Fool, when he was rattling on, to divert his poor distressed Master, feemed to be the only thing worthy Attention. ML nutius has a very good Library in the next Room to that in #hich we fat, and in a
quarter

quarter of an Hour all the Several Editions of Shakefpear, and all the old Dictionaries that could be thought on, overSpread the Table. Each Man took one, and was very buSy in looking over it. But now I Soon found, that the finding out the Meaning was not the Defign neither; but the Point chiefly aimed at by every Perfon, was to prove his own Conjectures right; and, as Soon as any one mentioned a Hint, that he thought he had discovered the Author’s Meaning, all the rest, without confidering of it. Set themSelves immediately to prove him in the vTong with So eager an Emulation, that they would hardly give one another Leave to Speak.
When I was convinced this was tli^e Cafe, I left them, alternatively disputing and poring over their Books; and yet I will anSwer for it, if they fat all Night, they were never the nearer concurring in their Opinions. I could not forbear Smiling, to See them So long neglect what was really valuable, to employ themSeives with Such Earnestnest about a Trifle ; not that I have any Fanlt to find with this Branch A 4	of

of Criticism; for the bnfy, restleSs Mind of Man is well employed, when it is innocently amuSed: But I should be Sorry to fee the Farmer, altho’ Straw and Stubble may be uSeful properly applied, take a fancy that he could make them into Bread, whilst he litter’d the Stable, and fed his Hogs with Wheat and Oats.
True WiSdom confists in making the right USe of every thing, even what is most trifling, but always So as to keep the Power of distinguishing what is estimable' in itSelf, from that which at best can only be Said not to be hurtful. But the Re-fledion on this, has lince become a melancholy Confideration to me^ by observing that the EagerneSs for this Sort of Criti-cifm in thoSe Gentlemen, really ariSes from a- Motive which Spoils their Characters, hardens their Hearts, and makes them Secret Enemies to each other: for, altho’ a Delight in the Same Subject of Conversation brin^ them often together, yet they rather meet like Prize-Fighters, in hopes of gaining a Victory, than like Friends to instruct and pleaSe each other; and, like
Prize-
LETTER XX. 9
Prize-Fighters, they shake Hands at meeting, tho’ each knows in his Heart, he comes there to flash and cut his Antagonist without Mercy, deep enough to draw the Blood, only to shew his own Strength and Skill. In all their Arguments, the great Fear of granting too much, lest what followed should make against their own favourite Conjectures, and the Expref-fions they made ufe of, Such as, I am jure that is unanfwerable Now I have gained that Point, &c. were strong Proofs, what Point they propoled to gain, namely, the Honour of having first found out what, in their Opinions, appeared of too great ConSequence, to yield the Glory of it to any but themfelves.
Another Art too I found they made. uSe of, was this, that when they could not prefently recollect any thing to the purpofe, shey raiSed their Voices to fuch a pitch in talking from the Purpofe, as vifibly shewed a Refolution, that no one elSe should be heard. And, whenever one of theSe Gentlemen are catched Separate
from
lo L E T T E R XX.
from the rest, the fly Innuendos, and depreciating Expreflions they think proper, from their great FriendJhipSy and Love to their Companions, to afford one another, are plain Proofs how much Affection or Taste, and how little Vanity is concerned in the Choice of their Company. And I was told last Night by a Gentleman, who has had a long Acquaintance with them all, that he has known them do a hundred fly underhand Tricks, to hurt one another, notwithstanding they stem fo well pleafed to be together ; and, whilst one of them is in Company, the Conversation never ceafes on the Failings of the rest, from the great Sorrow and Companion he has for thern. Unfortunate for him, poor Man! that his Mind could chufe to dwell fo long on a Subject, that fo vifibly makes him uneaSy.
But, to prevent my falling into the fame Error myfelf, I will dwell no longer on this disagreeable Subject; for, I am very certain, what I have Said, joined with your own Experience of the World, will

Cratander to Lysimachus at Cambridge.
SIR,
[From London.
I AM very Sorry you met with Such dull Company in your Journey; but as you was out of their reach when I had the PleaSure of your Letter, I could not help bein^ entertained with your Account of their various Characters; becaufe my Mind immedktefy ran over fo many Scenes of my Life, where the whole Company have been difpleafed, for no other Reafon but a mhle and wife Refolution of being fo. Your Account of the Criticks is So just a Picture of many Conversations, and fo lively a Re-prefentation of the Motives to numberlefs ill-natuf d Actions we are at first startled
at,
L E T T E R XXL 13
at, and puzzled to find out any Motive at all for; that it forced me to place before my Eyes Several of my Acquaintance whom . I Should be very glad not to fee in that light. But there are many Scenes in the common Intercourse with Men, that in themSelves would appear ridiculous, and be the Subjedt of Laughter, if Experience did not prove them Such strong and indelible Marks of Mens Characters, as makes the Reflection painful. I will now give you an Example of what I fay.
I Spent the Evening before last at Rufus'Si where was alSo Firithous, Empe-docleSi and L’iberius. When I came in, they were all in fuch an uproar of laughing, that it was Some time before I could find out the CauSe of their Mirth, (and I believe was I to give you a hundred Years to gueSs the Joke, you would still be ignorant of it.) But at last Rufus told me, as well as he could Speak in the Intervals of his Fits of Laughter, that CaiuSy a particular Friend of theirs, was utterly ruined by his own Fault; for that he had taken it into his head to fall in love with Frifcillay
who
14 LETTER XXL
who had first undone, and then jilted him: ** Now, continued he, I loved the Man very well; he has often made me merry^ “ and I should have pitied him, if any un-** forefeen Accident had befallen him; but “ it is fo much his own Folly to be So de-ceived, that I cannot help being diverted ** with it. I warrant he thought the Lady liked him j yes, no doubt, she was in
love with him.-Here he stopt, for
this mighty Jest renewed the Mirth, and the Roar continued, till I really grew quite peevish, and could not forbear Saying, I fuppofe, Gentlemen, if you had any Friend fo ill of the Small-Pox, that his Recovery was deSpaired of, and if you could find that he had got the Difeafc, by going out when he might have stayed at home, and you could difoover by that means that you might any way call it his own Fault; you would think him the Objedt of Mirth. They all stared at me for Some time as if I had been a Monster, for not participating in their Jollity, as they were pleafed to think it. At last Empedocles, with a Shrug of his Shoulders, and a contemptuous Sneer, thought proper to anSwer me thus;
“ And
LETTER XXI. 15
And pray, Sir, are you the weeping Phi-loSopher ? Are you too wife to be mer^ “ ry ? Pray what are the proper Objects of Ridicule^ but thoSe Misfortunes which “ Folly and Ignorance bring upon People ? ‘‘ I don*t know what one has to do in this “ World, but to divert one’s Self at others “ Expence. For it is their own Fault: “ Why do they give us that Advantage ** over them I afliire you, I would not loSe the Capacity or Opportunity of be-“ ing merryand enjoying the Company oj “ my Friends, for all your fancied WiSdom “ and cynical Philosophy.”
All this Wit, added to the whimfical Gestures of the Speaker, caufed another loud Roar; and then Pirithous took me to talk as follows: “ Now, Friend, fays , ” he, I will tell you a Story, which if ‘‘ you don’t think ridiculous, I will give y you up to your own four Difpofition, and utterly defpair of curing you. A “ Friend of mine the other day was ar-‘‘ rested, and carried to Prifon : And what do you think was the Caufe of it ? Nei-y ther Extravagance nor Misfortunes; but 3	‘‘ he

“ he was So great a Fool, that he could “ never enjoy any thing, unleSs his Friends “ shared it with him; and So strenuoufly “ he Served one at one time, and another “at another, that at last he could Support “ it no longer 5 and has now no hopes of “ Relief. He fent to me to have been “ Bail for him; but I knew better things. “ No, no, thought I, who would be Fool “ then f I have often adviSed him not to “ go on fo; but the ^lly Wretch would not hearken to mei And now I fuppoSe “ you would have me cry, becaufe he “ finds to his own Cofi, how much I was “ in the right. But indeed I shall not; for I am pleaSed with it. If indeed a Banker had broke, or any thing of that “ kind——Here Tiberius, in haste to vent a fine Sentence, interrupted him, and cried out, “ Right, Empedocles r, if after all the prudent Confiderations for himfelf “ a Man ought to have, any Misfortunes “ had attended him, and he had not been “ to blame, he certainly had been the Ob^ jedl of Pity; Christianity then would have obliged us to Compaffion.’;^
The

The word Christianity uttered in this manner, by a Wretch who in the Same Breath dared to plead in justification of indulging cruel SenSations, struck me with Such Horror, that I left the Room with the utmost Precipitation. But as I went out, I heard echoing Laughter refound So loud, that I was convinced they were enjoying the Triumph they thought due to the Vidtory of having drove me from the Room, as they imagined, by the Strength of their Arguments, and the Force of their Understandings. You may be Sure I did not give myfelf any trouble about what they thought; and I really was shocked to restedt, what must be the real Motive of all the Adlors in this, to me horrid, to them entertaining Scene. I did not want any further light into their Charadters; but happening this Morning to Speak of this Conversation to a Gentleman with whom I breakfasted, he told me he knew them all four, and the History of their Lives very well; and he would tell me a particular Story of each of them, which he thought as strong Charadteristicks as could be given.

Although I thought I knew them full enough.^ yet Curiofity to know how their Lives tallied with their late DiScourSe, led me to accept my Friend’s Offer; and he began as follows:
RUFUS lost his Mother when he “ was ten years old. His Father married “ again, as Soon as Decency would per-mit. He chofe a young Lady born and “ bred a Gentlewoman, altho’ She had no “ Fortune to bring with her. But if it “ was possible for any Behaviour to make “ amends for the want of it, Delia (for that was the young Lady’s Name) might ‘‘ justly be faid to do fo. Contrary to “ most Step-Mothers, she endeavoured by “ an unaffedfed Love for her Hushand’s Son, to loSe that Distinction ; and by all “ the Marks of a parental Fondnefs, tried “ to make Rufus forget she was not his “ Mother by Nature. But as her Hushand was very covetous in his DiSposstion, and / as his Love for her was only an ungo-“ vernable Paffion for her Perfon, Soon “ grown weary of that, he looked on her “ as having cost him greatly too dear ; and
“ continually
LETTER XXL 19
continually calculated, how much Money he was out oS pocket through her Means, by confidering the Fortune his Estate might have demanded with another Woman. Rufus, who has all the little low Cunning that generally waits on Folly, made uSe of every mean Artifice to aggravate his Father’s Distike to his Wife ; and the Life the poor Woman led" between them, was too miferable to admit of a Description. When Rufus was One-and-twenty, his Father died: he had taken care to Settle but half enough to keep his Wife, before he was married, that she might be debarred from any Claim afterwards. This he did, only to try if by her Behaviour she would deServe more; which she certainly did not: for she was guilty of that great Offence of not being able to prevent his being tired of her Perfon, and to enhance her Crime, behaved in fuch a manner, that he could not poshbly throw the fault on her. He therefore left her nothing more than he had at first Settled ; and the moment he was dead, Rufus barbaroufiy turned this Mother (for fo B 2	“she

The Scheme, contrary to a very high degree of Probability, failed; Phocion was undone, and Liberius disappointed ; but would not bear the Disappointment, without Somewhere wreaking his Revenge. The unfortunate Phocion then must be the Objedt of it; all ReaSons were vain, a total Incapacity of paying the Money was not admitted as an Inducement to Mercy. Liberiiis demanded but his own, and Phocion in jujiice could not deny complying with His Demand, whether it was in his power or no. Phocion, irritated with repated InSults, and more galled with Liberiufs cruel Behaviour than his own unhappy Circumstances, could not help at last representing to him, how unreasonable it was thus to upbraid him with the not performing Impoffibilities.

So p HRONIA to Celia at London.
Dear Celia,	[From the Country.
YO U will See by this, I have not forgot our reciprocal PromiSe of a Cor-refpondence when we parted; and, as our Separation is my only Punishment in this Retreat from Noife and Hurry, it is indeed very improbable, I should negledl any Opportunity of converling with you.
The preSent Calm of my Mind, unruffled by Paffions, undisturbed by any Perturbation, daily strengthens thofe Sentiments you always fo vehemently oppofe; namely, how much more eligible it is, to be contented with EaSe, and moderate A-mufements, than to be continually graSping
at
30 LETTER XXII.
at Pleasures So refined, that they are at most, but barely to be come at; and are generally So greatly overbalanced by the Torments that accompany them.
Books of PhiloSophy are now my Delight ; and I can fit Hours under the Shade of a great Tree, converfing with thoSe Sages of Antiquity, who, by the Help of a Transtator, are intelligible to an Englijh Reader. By their Assistance, 1 can conquer all my Passions; and you cannot imagine the PleaSure I receive from finding their Sentiments correfpond So exadlly with my own.
I Am Sometimes led to flatter mySelf, that (young as I am) were they alive, and preSent, they would not diSdain to converSe with me. This Thought encourages me to proceed in my PhiloSophy; and J find an Indulgence in it, that fully compensates the Pains I take to Subdue my PaS-ssons. I have my Companions too among the modern Ethical Writers; and when I read in Rochefocault^ that it is difficult to 3	conquer
LETTER XXII. 31
conquer our Pastions, but impossible to Satisfy them 5 I am So vastly pleaSed with the Thought, that I have So wiSely preferred a Study, in which I can find fo much to pleafe-me, to the foolissi Attempt of attaining Impossibilities, that I fit for Some time pleafed with the delightful Meditation, how much I am in the right.
IN my PurSuits, I look on mySelf as a Heroine that have combated Giants, and lain them all dead at my Feet; for Peace and Joy fill my Mind, and no tumultuous Pafiion invades my Breast. But, when I have enjoy’d my own Thoughts, and the PhiloSophy of others, till my Imagination cools, and will dwell no longer on one Subjed, there is another that constantly starts up, and confirms me in the Resolution of not purSuing PleaSure ; namely, an Observation I have always made, that thoSe People, who are most greedy after it, fail most in the attaining it j for one may Say of PleaSure, what a very ingenious Author fays of Fame:

Fame is a Bubble, the ReferEd enjoy : Who Jirive to grafp it, as they touch de-Jiroy.
For whenever I have met with any thing to pleaSe me, it has been without my Seeking; and, when my Mind has taken a philosophical Turn, and I have in my Thoughts given up the World, and all its Enjoyments.
Thus I can beguile many Hours, independent from the rest of Mankind; and when I am tired with my own Contemplations, walk home fatisfied with my Sentiments, and yet convinced, that, if any thing above this state of Eafe is reServed for me, it will come, when it will come, without my being at any trouble or 'pains to find it. But you and I have had So many Arguments on this head, that I think it almost time to leave it.

She lived in a continual Fright, lest she should act contrary to his Inclinations; and yet, from^his Over-corn-plaiSance, found it was impossible to know what was most agreeable to him. In short, in the little time I have known him, he has assumed Such a Multitude of Characters, as in the Repetition would appear almost incredible. He is good or bad, estimable and contemptible, filly and Senfible, all by turns, just as Accident throws thoSe various Characters in his way; but the most unfortunate Whim that ever enter’d into his Head, is that, by which he at preSent regulates himSelf: He is' become intimate with Petriichio, whoSe Wife is So great a Shrew, that she goes by no other Name, than that of my Lady Love-rule, Petruchio has Understanding enough not to give way to all her Rages and Passions; and therefore often affects to be in an equal, or greater Rage, in order to conquer her in her own way. Then home comes Eiliiis^ storms, fumes and frets at his Wife, and puts himSelf in a Paffion almost frightful to behold, for just nothing at all; he is feSolved to act the Tamer of the Shrew,
and
LETTER XXII. 35
atld only forgets, that it is neceffary, in brder to top the Part, to have a Shrew to tame j for that Chhe is one of the meekest: and most fubmistive temper’d Women in the World, is a Circumstance that never once enters into his Thoughts. The Lamb in the Fable could not plead for his Life more fruitlestly to the Wolf, than does the innocent Chloe^ to abate the Rage of her incenfed Hushand; incenSed only, becalife it's neceffary to keep up his own prefent assumed Character, without any Provocation from the imaginary Shrew.

LETTER XXIII.
Celia to Sophronia in th Country^
Dear Sophronia, \Erom Londcu..
OUR not changing your Sentiments, I by retiring into the Country, you may be very Sure, does not greatly amaze me; for a young Woman, who was daily courted and admired by a Variety of a-greeable Objedis, and yet was obstinately bent, in the midst of them, to preferve the Reflection, that an indolent EaSe was her only Refource from Pains and Torment, must certainly preferve the fame way of thinking in Solitude, where there is no Temptation to alter it: but take care you do not deceive yourfelf; for k appears to me, that your dwelling fo often and So strongly on the Necefiity of conquering
your
LETTER XXIII. 39
your Passions, is Some Small Indication of the. great Difficulty you find in doing So.
Perhaps, whilst you fit and enjoy the Thought of your being worthy to con-verSe with the Sages of Antiquity, all your Passions may not be So entirely lulled to steep as you imagine. Remember, my dear Sopbronia^ that Pride has a Place, if not the very first Place, amongst thoSe Giants you Seem to fancy, you have So like a Heroine combated and overcome.
But when you have triumphed in your Conquests, long enough to be tired with your own dazzling Splendor, and have strengthened your laudable Resolutions of avoiding and Shunning PleaSure, by the Refiedtion, that it is generally the Portion of thoSe who least purSue it; then indeed I must confeSs, that you are perfedlly contented with your great, free, and wiSe philosophical Sentiments. Yes; undoubtedly you deSpiSe the End, whilst you are pleaSed to employ the Means you think most likely to attain that End. This may paSs on others; but I, that have known C 4	you
40 LETTER XXIII.
you from your Infancy, cannot be thus impofed on. For I fancy, if a Man was to fay, that he had left following a Woman, becaufe he found her DiSpofition was Such, that the more he purfued her, the more she fled from him, you would not fay that was any Sign of his Indifference to her; but no Fallacy gains our Belief fo eafily, as thofe which are fupported by our inclining to believe that they are true.
I Thank you fcr the Fable you Sent me, and think it too natural. Poor Chloe's. Fate really concerns me; but I cannot, from her Misfortunes, conclude all Happinefs to be quite unattainable. If from Instances of that kind we are to draw fuch Conclu-fions, in time we may bring ourfelves to be as infipid as Stocks or Stones, and as unanimated as that very Tree, you fo much delight to shade yourfelf under. There is no Abfurdity we may not by this means give into. We may wish to be born dull, decrepid, old and ugly, becaufe Spirit, Vivacity, Youth and Beauty have brought with them long Trains of Ills, which
might
LETTER XXIII. 41
might be owing to thoSe very Advantages of Nature.
. A F T E R all I can Say, if you are unalterably fixed to your Choice, and reSolve to wish (or at least to fancy you wish) for no higher Blifs than meer Eafe, all Arguments will prove vain, and you must continue to act the Part of a PhiloSopher.
But as to my own part, I am convinced I could never make this Scheme agree with my volatile whimfical Temper. My Defires are not So moderate as to be So Satisfied; and I must aim at PleaSure, tho’ it Serves but to quicken the SenSe of Pain.— Well! let my Life be a fickle AprU-D2ij ; for though it be attended with Wind or Hail, there will be fome gay Intervals of blue Heavens and bright Sunshine; and I should prefer it with all its Changes to the comfortable Constancy of a cloSe, warm, uneaSy, low’ring Sky, where one is free indeed from the Terrors of a Storm, but then the SenSes are all stupified by a Fog. In short, there is nothing I So much dread as ' being always asteep j and yet to repeat DoSes
of
42 LETTER XXIII.
of opium, and steep away our Time, is not more abSurd than to Spend our Lives in. an Endeavour to keep our Minds but half awake; and from a cowardly Fear of ever meeting with an uneafy Senfation, to lull away the very Capacity of enjoying any one that is pleafing.
Last Night I Spent an Evening So agreeably to my Humour, that it dwells yet upon my Imagination ; and by the help of Refiecstion, I in a manner make it still prefent to me.
My Brother drove me into the Country in a ChaiSe. The Beauties of the Evening, and the various ProSpedls we beheld, are not to be defcribed. We fat in our Vehicle on Wimbleton-Common^ where we could at one View behold the largest and most beautiful Rainbow I ever faw, all the various Colours in Nature were there displayed. The whole City of London gilded by the Setting Sun, and the Country all around us intermixed with Hills and Valleys, Wood and Water, was placed before our Eyes. You know my Brother’s Imagination is So
lively.
letter XXIII. 43
lively, that Such a Scene could not be lost upon him ; and his Remarks and Taste made me doubly enjoy it.
1N coming home, we accidentally went a Small matter out of the Road, to continue the FroSpedt as long as postJble; by which means a little Hillock on one fide of the ChaiSe, which my Charioteer did not perceive, had like to have overturned us. I was frighted for the preSent Moment; but we came off Safe, and the Fright was Soon over.
T flis Accident brought you to my Remembrance ; and I could not help thinking how much you and I Should differ in our Restedfions on Such an Occafion. I delighted mySelf with comparing that trifling Inconvenience with the great PleaSure I had in being with a Perfon whoSe Taste was the Sole CauSe of it; and rejoiced in the Thought, that I had not been Saved from that Small Fright, by being teazed with the DulneSs of a Blockhead, who in the midst of that charming Scene would have been incapable of thinking of any thing but the

S IR,
[From London.
The many Hours you and I have Spent in Arguments on the Subjedl oS Vanity, bring you to my Remembrance wherever I go. I believe it is to indulge my own Pride, that I am So willing to recoiled: our DiScourSes on that Head; as I fancy I find Proofs in every Company, how much I was in the right, when I asserted, that the Motive to most Conversations, was nothing more than a Defire of justifying our own Passions, exulting in our Situations, or shewing our own Parts. The strong Inclination I have to convince you of my Penetration, gives you the trouble
of
46 LETTER XXI.
of this Epistle. However, I will be generous enough to tell you, that if you cannot bear finding yourSelf in the wrong, I would not have you read it; becaufe I think you cannot stand out against the Instances I Shall here give you, and will be forced to confefs, that Vanity has a greater Share in the human Mind, than you would ever yet allow me.
I Spent the Evening yesterday at^ a Tavern with four young Gentlemen, each of very different Characters, and all Men of Wit and Parts. One is an Epicure, another a Philosopher, a third an ambitious Man, and the fourth adtuated chiefly by Avarice.
For Some time the Conversation was lively and agreeable ; but after the Clock had struck twelve, and the Bottle began to throw them a little off their Guard, we fell into a DiScourSe on Human Nature, and the Paffions of Mankind. No Sooner was this Subject introduced, than the QuixotiSm of each Man began to exert it-Self. The good SenSe which they could i	utter
LETTER XXIV. 47
Utter on every other Topick, fled before the very Thoughts of their favourite Paf-flon; and instead of endeavouring to examine and distinguish right from wrong, the only Aim of each PerSon was to prove, that whatever is the Bent of his own Nature, is the wifest and best PurSuit. /
The Epicure immediately began to wish he had more Senfes than Man is endued with, and more Objeds than the World produces to gratify them. Discontented with his own Situation, he only modestly wished to rob each Creature of its chief Perfedion; the Hawk’s Sight, the Hound’s Smell, and the Spider’s Subtle Feeling were all the Objeds of his Envy : and then, when he had in his own Opinion a long time eloquently displayed the Wisdom of purfuing PleaSure, he always concluded with a contemptuous Sneer at the rest of Mankind for the Folly of their various PurSuits.
The Philosopher could very well an-Swer the Epicure, that his Over-GreedineSs for Pleasures was the way to lofe all Enjoyments j and that by reaching So far be-•3	yond
48 LETTER XXIV.
yond the Mark, he lost even what was to be attained. But when this PhiloSopher came to humour his own Fancy, and to prove that WiSdom alone is HappineSs, he argued himSelf into a Stock or Stone, and talked in Such high Flights of the Contempt of Pleafure, as must indeed render ‘a Man utterly incapable of enjoying any.
The ambitious Man had an equal Contempt for them both, and made a long Harangue on the great Advantage of Power. He never once thought on any of the Anxieties that attend the getting or maintaining it, but turned every Argument on the most pleafing Side, and endeavoured with all his Art to prove, that in that alone true Happinefs was to be found. But instead of calling the Defire of Power Ambition, he gave it the Names of Spirit and Greatnefs of Mind.
The avaritious Man faid every thing he could think of, to prove that Money alone can give us Happinefs; but then he took great care to let us know, that he did not think it valuable for its own fake, but
for
LETTER XXIV. 49
for the Effects it produces; Such as ReSpect, Power, &c. expressing a Detestation for the Sordid MiSer who hoards up Goliji with no farther View; and applauding the Man who by Prudence and Oeconomy grows rich, and enables himSelf to purchaSe what he pleaSes.
I Was at first very well entertained; for as all theSe Gentlemen have good Understandings, every one Said as much as the Subject would bear. But when their Vanity began to be piqued by Contradiction, and they were warmed with a ReSolution of maintaining what they had once asserted, they really talked Such NonSenSe, as would have given me an Opinion they were all Fools, had I never Seen them before. As I was at last the only Hearer in the Company, they all appealed to me, and at the Same time gave me no Opportunity of answering them. It was near two a-clock before they were weary of talking.
I Went to bed very much tired; but this Morning could not help reflecting on the last Night’s Conversation. It appeared VoL. IL	D	odd
50 LETTER XXIV.
odd to me, how Men of Parts could bring themSelves to Say So many filly things, as every one of thefe Gentlemen had uttered on the Several Subjedts which each had engaged himfelf to defend. And from this Conversation, I thought I found the Reafon why Men of great Wit and Parts are generally Said to fail in point of Judgment: for there is no Faculty of the Mind or Body, but by being constantly unemployed may lofe its Force and Vigour. Thus when Inclination So far takes up the whole Man, as to Set him at his wits end to find Reasons for his Conduct, he immediately employs his whole Imagination, and begs the Favour of his Judgment not to be fo trou-bleSome as to interrupt him in his favourite Scheme, or to be any bar to his Pleafures: For he ufes every thing that dares but hint a disagreeable Truth to him, as his greatest Enemy; and nothing but Neglect and Scorn can be the Reward of Such audacious In-joknee. Thus the admirable Don ^ixote could Separate every Idea with the greatest Exactness, join them with the greatest Nicety, and talk judiciousty on every Subject, till the Profession of Knight-Errantry 3	became
LETTER XXIV. 51
became unluckily the Question ; and then Sheep were Armies, Windmills Giants, a Barber’s BaSon MambrintIs Helmet, nay a Country Wench winnowing of Wheat was Suddenly transformed into a great PrinceSs stringing of Pearl; with many other Whim-fies of a fantastick distempered Brain. His strong Fancy changed every thing he Saw into what he defired to fee. Even Sancho Panca^ a poor Country Fellow, who had not read Books of Chivalry, and whoSe Imagination fell far short of the JDc«’s Warmth; although he could fee an Inn was no Castle, Sheep no Armies, Windmills no Giants, yet no Sooner was mention made of she Government of that Ifiand Ire was to be rewarded with for all his Fatigues, than she tossing in she Blanket with every other DiSgrace and Pain he had Suffered, vanished from his Thoughts: Honour and Power filled his Mind, and he grew full as mad as his Master.

And I doubt not but a Man of Parts would prove, or endeavour to prove, a Buffoon to be the highest Charatster in Nature, if it was what he chofe to be himfelf. But to tire you no longer with my Observations, I went this Morning to vifit all theSe Gentlemen Separately; and to make good what I began with, namely, that Vanity is the Support of most Conversations, I must tell you I found every one of my Gentlemen uneaSy, for fear his Antagonists Should not think he had got the better. Each boasted his Victory, and found entire EaSe in nothing but a fancied Contempt for all who were So blind as not to be convinced by his powerful Arguments.

This ASternobn I fell into company with a Set of Ladies, who were extreme fond of Poetry. One of them had been just reading Lhe Rape of the Lock. They all protested their Admiration of that, and the rest of that Gentleman’s Poems; and each repeated the Lines that had funk deepest in her own Memory. I think I can remember every thing that was Said, and will fend it you just as it was Spoke in the first PerSon, as I think that will give you a stronger Idea of the Conversation.
BELINDA, (a Beauty of Sixteen, who had been married a Week.) What a strong Idea that Line gives ?
‘‘ There fat IlUnature like an aitcient “ Maid.

SIR,	[From Oxford.
IT H A N K you for your obliging Letter, and affure you, it has had the de-lired Effect on me; for the Scenes you fent me a Description of, and the Reflections I have fince made on them, have convinced me, I was in the wrong in all our Arguments concerning human Nature; and the Shame I now feel in owning my-felf So, will be fully compensated, by the continual Satisfaction I shall have in knowing for the future, I am in the right. E-very Company I go into, and every Observation I make, is an additional Confirmation of the Justice of your Opinion j
and
^8 LETTER XXV.
and I am So pleaSed, that Nature has given me SenSe enough to understand and admit Truth, when laid before me, and So fond of my new Difcovery, that no Child can be prouder or more delighted with stiewing a new Play-thing, than I am with displaying my late got Knowledge ; inSomuch^ that every third Word I Speak, and the Conclufion of every Sentence I utter, is Vanity, altho* I take great care to appear as if I had known all this from the time I was born ; becaufe it is pleafanter to make our Companions believe we get our Knowledge from Intuition, than that we are beholden to another for any Instructions. Like a Man recovered to Sight after long being blind, Truth breaks upon me with refistleSs Day; and I think I can account for every Phsenomenon in Nature.
I Am now no longer at a loSs for the ReaSon of Chromulus's Behaviour; for Chro-miilus was bred up at the Univerfity with Bilbus. They contracted a strict Friendship, and, in appearance, had a very great Affection for each other. Bilbus willingly endeavoured to instruct Cbromulus in evbry
thing
LETTER XXV.
thing he himSelf had learned; but Chro--mulus found, that his unfortunate Head could not comprehend the Meaning of all that his Friend was fo kind to wish to teach him; and therefore, when he was tired of wasting his Time, and beating his Brains to no manner of purpoSe, the only Refuge he had left, was to decry all Learning, to fwear it was a Mark of Dulnefs, and a Want of lively Parts to be able to fix an Attention fo strong, as to attain it; and, whenever Bilbus is mentioned in his Company, he shrugs up his Shoulders, and affeds with a ridiculous Sneer to shew an utter Contempt of him, faying, that in-deed he loved Bilbus mightily when he “ first went to the Univerfity, but neither he, nor any of his Companions could “ make any thing of him; for he was fo stupid, that he did nothing but pore on Greek Books, and grew a perfed Pe-“ dant concluding with a Sort of infult-ing Pity for him, ** that all good Company and merry Fellows were forced to leave ^ him off.’’
This,
6o LETTER XXV.
This, amongst the People with whom Cbromulus conwtrfeSy generally raiSes aHorSe-laughj and, as he fixes the Idea of Pedantry to learning Greek, his Companions are Sure it is no Satire upon them : and enjoy the fancied Ridicule, till they are all ready to burst with Pleafure and Joy, that there is any Expedient found out, to make them rest Satisfied in their own Want of Capacity ; and Pedant, Pedant, with the Interruption of nothing but Laughter, echoes through the Room, and Smiles or Grins of Approbation grace the Baboon Faces of thoSe, who triumph thus in their own NothingneSs; and, rather than not exult at all, find out a Pretence of exulting in their own Inferiority.
I A M now at no loSs for a ReaSon, why Delirius runs about, complaining for every trifling Misfortune which befals him; for all the Compaflion he meets with, is a Proof to him how much he deServes it: for, altho’ Satisfying his Appetites, taking his Rest, warming himSelf in the Winter, and cooling himfelf in the Summer, make
up
LETTER XXV. 6i
up the whole History oS his empty Life; yet, as he has been guilty of no Murder, Theft, or Cruelty, he thinks he has Merit enough, to exempt him from the common Misfortunes of Mortals : and his Impatience under them, is really owing to his Pride, in thinking he deferves to be exempted from all the MiSeries that befall his Fellow-Creatures. Nay, I have known him, when he has fancied himSelf under Some great Affliction, get a Cat to pur by him j for, from the melancholy Sound of that Creature, he feeds himSelf with the Fancy, that his Misfortune affeCts one living Animal however, befides himSelf, and this brings him fome ConSolation.
D 0 RIL A S indeed never complains: His Pride is of a Superior Degree ; and he has a Contempt for others Pity, as well as for their/^'lattery. He has Vanity enough to Satisfy himSelf without any Assistance j for, as he rests contented that he is the highest Creature in the whole World, he looks ■ down on all Mankind can Say, as below his Notice. In Misfortunes, his own Compassion for himSelf (which he is never without
62 LETTER XXV.
out in die highest Degree that can be imagined) is Sufficient, and in Prosperity his own Approbation of all his Actions (of which alSo he is very far from being niggardly) is enough to give him Content, without any foreign Help. He gratifies his Pride, by a fixed Opinion of his own Judgment, and then makes his Judgment So good-natur'd, as never to condemn either his Words or Actions. Thus, like the Spider, his own native Stock furniShes him with Sufficient Matter for his Gratification, and he fortifies himSelf with the Cobweb-Net wove by his own Inclination.
But, lest you should be tired of his Character, I will Say no more of him, but proceed to relate a Conversation I had the other day with four old Gentlemen, the youngest being Threeshore. They found fault with every thing they met with; one would not allow the Women to be as handSome as formerly: The Second could not bear the Dresses at preSent in fashion. infisting upon it, that they are not half So grand, nor do they give that i^ir of Dignity, as thoSe that were wore when they
were
LETTER XXV. 63 were young Men. The Third found fault with all our Actors and ActreSTes, and, with a piteous Shake of his Head, Seemed to regret the LoSs of what he had feen at Thirty, when every thing was fo much more in perfection, Shan in theSe degenerate Days. The Fourth could not bear what the young People of thefe Times call PoliteneSs and Good-breeding. In his Youth there was Some Civility, Some Good-manners ; but now indeed, under the pretence of being eafy, People throw off all Ceremony and Decency together.
I L E T them run on at this rate for Some time, without giving them any Interruption. At last I defired .the old Gentlemen to confider whether the Fault might not be in themSelves; hinting, that it was just possible a Man of Sixty or Seventy was not So SuSceptible of PleaSure, as in his Youth; and consequently things might not appear in So favourable a light to him, as when every PleaSure was heightened by Youth, and a .lively Imagination.
They
64 LETTER XXV.
They all stared at me at once, as if they had Seen a Monster. Undoubtedly they took me for one, for being So very unreasonable, as to fancy thirty or forty Years could pofiibly make any Alteration in them : And I found they were reSoIved to believe the whole Creation was grown worfe, and the Face of Nature changed, rather than that there was any Fault in themfelves. I left them, not being able to restrain myfelf from laughing at their Folly j and, I must confefs, with a fecret Satif-faction in the Thought, that, if I Should live to be old, it will be impossible for me ever to be So great a Fool. But I enjoy Life much the better, now I have in a manner got a Key to all the Scenes I meet with.
I Spent Yesterday in a Party of Plea-Sure on the Water; but after a very fair Morning, about three a-clock the Clouds Suddenly gathered, and we had So violent a Storm of Rain and Wind, that our Boat tossed, and we Seemed in great Danger of being overfet. The Ladies Screamed, and were So restleSs in their apparent Fright^
that
LETTER XXV. 65
that I really thought, if we eScaped the Dangers of the Waves, they themSelves would Fring that to paSs, of which they Seemed ib fearful; whilst the Gentlemen employed themSelves in nothing, but in hushing the Ladies Fears, and affuring them, that for their own ^arts., they were not in the least apprehenfive of any Danger, But as Fear, like all other violent Paffions, will shew its Effects in the Countenance, I plainly perceived, that the Ladies were at that very Instant affecting more Fear than in reality they felt, to prove their Tittle to that TimorouSneSs and Softnefs, which are esteemed So amiable in their Sex; and the Gentlemen were equally as much affected in their pretended Unconcern, to shew they were poffeffed of that Courage fo necessary to recommend them. And thus in the Danger of immediate Death, they could not help thinking of making themSelves reciprocally Objects of Admiration,
For my own part, I confeSs I was not pleafed wish our Situation; and yet the great Contempt I had for the ridiculous VoL. II.	E	Pride
66 LETTER
Pride So vifible in all my Company, good deal employed my Thoughts. I was pleaSed to think I was the only PerSon that was not acting a Part; and I could not help crying out with Solomony “ Every thing is Vanity;” a DiScovery I Should certainly have made Sooner, but that, being almost exempt from Vanity mySelf, it was Some time before I could See it So strong in others: and I claim no Merit in having now found it out, but that of understanding, and being convinced by, your ReaSons.

AureliA to Silvia at Canterbury*
Dear S i l v i A,	[From London*
ON my first arrival in Town, I Spent a Day with Cleora. We were very intimate one Winter, when She was first married to Celadon; but, as I have lately refided mostly in the Country, I have had but few Opportunities of converfing with her. Her Conversation was always agreeable to me, and I propoSed great PleaSure in this Renewal of our Acquaintance.
I W A s conducted by a great Variety of Servants through many Rooms of State, till I came to her Apartment, where She fat mourning in Grandeur, and where Grief, E 2	tho’,
68 LETTER XXVI.
tho’ attended with Pomp, was vifibly displayed in her Countenance. Instead of the lively blooming Cleora I formerly remem-bred, her wan Complexion, and lifeleSs Manner indicated the Decay of Age, al-tho’ she was too young for Time to have wrought that Change. She feemed glad to See me; and I could hardly refrain from Tears, to behold her thus altered and dejeded. At last I afked her, what could have occafioned this melancholy Alteration ?
Alas! replied Cleora., you know but “ little of the History of my unhappy
Life ; for the Winter I chiefly Spent “ with you, was the gayest and most free “ from Anxiety I ever knew.” I told her, that I was indeed ignorant of the most part of what had befallen her, both before, and fince that Winter; but that, if it would not be an impertinent Request, I Should defire to be informed of any Particulars that concerned her; on which she, with a Sigh, began to relate the History Qf her Life in the following Manner,
PURI^C
LETTER XXVI. 69
During my Childhood, nothing very remarkable happened to me. Both ' my Parents lived till I was Fifteen; and I was educated in a manner So Very common, that, if I was to repeat every thing that pasted during that whole time, it would be like writing a Journal of what is daily Seen in almost every HouSe throughout all this whole Metre-polls.
“ But when I was Fifteen, my Father died. He had a good Estate, which devolved on his only Son ; and my Fortune, confidering the manner in which I had lived with him, Was very Small, and could not afford me any thing liki! what I had been accustomed to: however, I lived on with my Mother id Town, till I was Eighteen, without any farther Gonfideration, than fcow I Should divert niySelf, and fpend my Time hiost agreeably.

One day my Mother told me, she could no longer fupport the Expences of a Town-Life, and was refolved to take a little Houfe in Oxford. I knew no particular Reafon for her chufing that Place ; but, as I had no Attachment, I fubnaitted to what she liked without any Reludance. She gave me a great many Instrudtions how I should behav^ mySelf towards the young Gentlemen there, and cautioned rne what great Tare was neceffary, to preServe a Wo^ man’s Reputation.

I was very uneaSy at this Alteration in her Behaviour, and reSolved to afk her the Caufe of it; when, to my .great astonishment, after the Vent of many Tears, She anfwered me inthefe or the like Words: “ Alas, Child ! you do not know what I have done for you : Since your Father, my dear Hushand’s .Death .(here She was a-gain interrupted by Tears) J have lived fo much beyond my Income, that I am almost ruin’d ; and this I did, in hopes that, whilst you made a good Appearance, you might have been well married ; for many a Man, who would on no account think of marrying the most .agreeable Woman in the World without a Fortune, by the falSe Glare of outward ..Shew, is drawn in to indujlge him-E 4	“ feif

at first greatly Surprized to hear my Mother run on in this manner, and, without thinking any harm, afked her; If she had no Fondnefs for her Hushand, why she always fell into Tears at the mention of his Name At first she fell into a great Rage, and laid; You are a Fool, and,do not know the common Rules of Decency: how can any Woman hear all the melancholy Things, which are at first Said by her Friends on Such an occafion, without crying .? and .Cust^ makes it as natural

I was in hopes, by living beyond my Circumstances, to fee you well, that is, grandly married in London. I fail’d in that Scheme; then I came hither,

My not mak-ing any particular Application, would “ be. taken for Modesty : but above all things.

The moment I catched the Flame, ‘‘ Imagination blew up the Happinefs of “ Equipage, and all the Attendants ofFor-“ tune, to Such a height, that, blinded by ‘‘ the dazling glittering View, every Solid “ Confideration vanished before the glaring ‘‘ Blaze, and I became So absolutely Subjedled ‘‘ to this new-born or new-found Fancy, f‘ that, like other Slaves, I did not dare to en-* tertain the Truth, ^en in my Thoughts.

I found Methods of making the Covetous perfuade themfehes^ “ that the cheapest thing a Man could do, “ was to marry ; for a Wife, confidering “ his Interest as her own, would certain-ly contrive every Method of being as Saving as She could.

Thus, by properly ap-“ plying to Mens various DiSpofitions, I “ turned even thoSe Passions, that in ap-“ pearance Seem’d to make against me, to “ my own USe. In a Small time I was “ become Such a Proficient in Cunning, “ that my Mother’s Instructions were no “ longer necessary: The most difficult Part “ I had to play, was that of difcarding a ‘‘ Lover, without fuffering his Rage at ‘‘ being forfaken to do me an Injury; for “ I could not help forfaking one Man for “ another, as Soon as I came to confider “ nothing but the Estates to which my “ Several Lovers were Heirs apparent, and “ look’d on them in no other fight, than “ that in which a TradeSman Sees the In-“ strument of his Trade, by which he is ‘‘ enabled to attain his purpoSed End of getting Money.
However, I was not long, before “ I found out that Men, tho’ at first en-raged at being flighted, are not altoge-“ ther inconfolable: and when I was re-

“As Soon as we were married, at my “ Hushand’s Request, I left off converfing “ with any other of the young Gentlemen. “ I had obtained my Ends, and now thought I had no further uSe of Art. I knew we could not be unmarried, and V.OL. IL	F	“did

'
“ CELADON defired me to come-to him; and, with my Fortune, tho’ it was but fmall, yet, as we lived upon the Principal we wanted for nothing that was neceffary or convenient; and, as Celadon's Father could not hinder his Son from inheriting his Estate at his Death, my future ProSpedt was very good, and I made mySelf happy; be-fides, as Celadon was very hand Some, and had all manner of Accomplishments, and amiable Qualities, I had a Pashon for him, which till this Retirement, I had no time to difcover, even to my-felf; for my Mind was fo poffeffed at my first Acquaintance with him, with the Thoughts of his Estate, that I never con-fidered whether I liked or distiked him.

Thus was I married to a Man, for whom I had the most violent Passion, who treated me with a Negledt that made me hate mySelf, and every thing around me. I knew it was but what I deferved; for, altho’ I accidentally met with a Man, whom I could not help loving, yet I was very Senfible, that no Treachery could be greater than what I defigned. Had Celadon been the Objedl of my Averfion, I should have married him, and made ufe of his own Pashons to have undone him; and with all his Advantages of Nature and Fortune, he would have then been married to a Wo^ man, who had no Affedlion for him j therefore it was but Justice, I should have a fruitless Paffion for him, when his for me was irrecoverably lost. All Signs of Grandeur and Shew were hateful to me, as they only brought to my Remembrance, by what means I had obtained them. I was curSed like Midas., for his Wish of having all things he touched turn’d to Gold ; for I was in the midst of Riches, and yet could enjoy nothing.

Dear Aurelia, {From Canterbury.
LTHO’ I received your Letter when my Heart was in its utmost Gaiety, and my Vanity elated, (Sor I was just come from a Ball, where I was much admired and greatly flattered, and where I deign’d not in return, to cast an Eye of Favour on any of my Adorers) yet poor Chord!% Fate drew Tears stom my Eyes, and wrung my Heart with Sorrow. Her MiSery made her the Object of my Com-paffion; and, tho’ fhe ki Some fort de- . Served it, yet when I confider a Parent’s Commands were her first Inducements to practise Arts to enSnare Men, by the
Strength
90 LETTER XXVIL
Strength bS their preSent reigning Passion, that Confideration pleads Some ExcuSe for her MiScondud:: For terrible it is, that a Mother should missead her Daughter, and that even Experience should not have informed her, that the Gratification of Vanity is not capable of producing real Hap-pinefs : But I am afraid, when Parents give Such Advice, their Childrens Happi-nefs or Mifery has very little Sway with them.
This Story is to me a Confirmation of what I always thought; namely, that most part of the Miferies that attend Human Rind, take their rife from Mens not understanding, or feriousty resseding, that the chief Point of WiSdom confists in never making the Second Confideration the first.
Now the first Confideration in Matrimony, ought undoubtedly to be the DiS-pofition and Temper of the Man; what ProSped: there is of Happinefs at home; what Likelihood of his continuing his Passion, and whether you can in all Cafes conform to your Hushand’s Circumstances.
In
LETTER XXVIL 91
In short. Fortune should be no farther considered, than as it is conducive to the PleaSure oS the Man you marry; and your only ReaSon Sor thinking oS it at all should be, that you would not, to gratify your-Self, drag him down to ruin.
Had Clear a thought in this manner, she would have had time to have found out, that she really liked Celadon and her Fears of his future Diflike would have made her fcrupulous, confidering his Youth, of immediately confenting to the Match. Perhaps this Delay, as CeladoE^ Father had other Views, might have made her loSe her Hushand; but at the fame time AbSence, join’d with Negledt, might have enabled her to have overcome her Paffion; and, by Such a LoSs, I think it very plain, she would have been a very great Gainer in the end.
I Have known Some Women really marry, only becauSe the Man they chofe lived in a particular Town, which their preSent Fancy inclined them to inhabit; ^hen it has generally turned out, that
Some
92 letter XXVII.
Some unforeseen Accident has removed them from the fight of thofe Walls, to the beholding of which, they had Sacrificed their Hearts. On the other hand, I have heard of Women, who have chofe their HuS-bands for their own fakes, without any confideration where they lived, or what was their Profession ; and, however stupid this may appear to Some Eyes, yet I have generally remarked, that they have not repented their Condud:.
But it is not only in Matrimony, that People make themfelves miferable, by turning the Second Confideration into the first; there are many People, who could enjoy themfelves, and fee their Friends happy in the Country, and yet will not live out of the great Metropolis, tho’ every Diverfion there is to them as uncomeatable, as if they were in the Deferts of Arabia.
Th E RE are others, who fill their Heads fo still of the Pleafures of a fine Profped and a pleafant Situation, that they build away their Fortunes, till they find the Pleafures they receive at their Eyes, and the fresh
Ak
LETTER XXVII. 93
Air they breathe at their Nostrils, will make them but little amends for Swallowing all that was to Support the long Train of Paf-fions and Appetites they had, and might still have indulged, had not that very Spot of Ground been neceffary for them to build on, and improve, in order to compleat their imaginary Happinefs.
But Instances of this kind, even in my Small Experience, are So numberlefs, that it would be in vain to endeavour to recount them; yet, altho’ they are So common, I can hardly help wondering how Men can be So blind to their own true Interest.
For want of LeiSure, and Capacity of fending any thing more entertaining, I must conclude, with asturing you,

Z)^’n:r Camilla,	[From^2i\\\,
AS it is one of the great Pleafures of Friendship, reciprocally to communicate our Thoughts to each other; and, as it is my Opinion, that even my Duty obliges me thankfully to accept all "the Happinefs my Nature is capable of, whilst I preferve mySelf from Guilt; I doubly enjoy every new Idea, every freSh Subje6t of Observation, by refleDing on what you will think dr Say upon it.
Thus in my CloSet, at a hundred Miles distance, I converfe with you, previousty form in my Mind what will be your Answers ; and I am fo well acquainted with
your
LETTER XXVIII. 95
your way of thinking, that I flatter my-Self, that, was you preSent, you would generally Speak the Words I in fancy fay for you. Thus J contrive all the Methods I can, to make myfelf fome amends for our Separation; and am now fat down to acquaint you with every thing I have met with fince my last Letter, with an incredible PleaSure.
I Spent the whole Day before yesterday with Hortenjius and his Wife. He has very lively Parts, a good Understanding, and is in all refpedls an agreeable Companion. She is very pretty, has a fine Per-Son, and was, as I am told, before She was married, far from being diSagreeable in Company; but she has not a Capacity to rested: deeply, or enter into any of the Labyrinths of the human Mind: and yet, as a Man of Senfe is fond of her, it is im-poffible to make her believe, that her Understanding is not equal to his. And thus, from an Affedation of knowing every thing, she is become inSupportable, and knows nothing; for that Capacity she naturally had, is totally lost in the Confufion of Ideas,
which
96 LETTER XXVIII.
which her strong Defire of being thought wiSe, creates.
HORTENSIUS employed the Morn^ ing in reading to us: Milton's Paradije Loft was the Book he pitched on, and I expedled to be very much entertained with his agreeable Manner of reading, and his Remarks, which are generally very judicious. But his Wife interrupted every thing he Said, in a way almost impoffible to defcribe: however I will try, by a Repetition of one or two of her Mistakes, to make it as plain as I can.
For example, when Hortenftus was diS tinguistiing the vast Difference between Eve's. Soliloquy, wherein She gives the ReaSons to induce her to tempt her HuS-band, and admits this as the strongest, that he Jhould not he happy without her • and Adam's generous difinterested Resolution, that he would not be happy without her; The Lady, preSuming to know what her Hushand meant before he had uttered his Words, turned every thing topSy-turvey; affured him stie was very much of his
Opinion^
LETTER XXVIII. 97
Opinion, that Eve's fuperior Tendernefs was very vifible, from that rW/rJ Thought of making it her chief Fear, her HuS-band Sliould be happy in a future Eve., and she alone be forced to Suffer the Punishment of her Disobedience. I was really astonished at this Turn, but Said nothing, for I knew not what AnSwer to make.
NODr£N5JN5readon; and when he came to the DiSpute between Adam and Eve, which had been most in fault, he could not help remarking the great Alteration of Adam's Style fince the Fall. That pure and difinterested Love, he uSed before to exprefs, was vanished, and in its stead came Tumult and DiScord ; and he could not help making unavailing Reproaches against his Wife for an Adfion, which the utter Impostibility of recalling, should have made him unwilling to remind her of. (Al Example not perfedily forgot by the greatejl part of his Poferity.) Here the Lady a-gain interpofed, and Said; “ she had al-“ ways thought it one of the greatest Beau-“ ties in Adam's Character, that he upbraid-ed his Wish, only when she deferved it, VoL. II.	0	and
^8 L E T T E R XXVIIl.
and therefore (htmujl feel it most:'* and it was very plain by her AnSwer, that she was hurt with his Rebuke. For, altho’ at first stie gives a Hint, that Adam might have been tempted as well as herSelf, yet in the End of her Speech She is vifibly penitent, and owns that her Hushand’s Folly in giving way to her Humour, was the CauSe of her Fall; and therefore humblj confeffes, it was intirely his Fault, and Self-justified, finds her own perfed: Innocence in his Crime. This fhe Spoke Seriousty, and really thought Eve's Humility was the Motive of her upbraiding Adam.
Perhaps you will imagine, that ILor~ tenfiiis^ impatient at his Wife's expoSing herSelf, must have laid down the Book in a rage ? No, on the contrary he Seemed vastly pleaSed with her. As I did not con-tradid any thing fhe Said, I fancy he was not Sure her Folly was vifible to mej and I plainly perceived he delighted him-felf, with the Thoughts of his own Superiority over a PerSon, who has So much the Power of plealing, as his Wife has. This made him gratiSy her Vanity in return, and
take
LETTER XXVIII. 99
lake care she should not See, but that he thought she was quite right in her Judgment of what he had been reading ; however, by Some Words he let drop, I found he imputed this Behaviour of his to Com-pashon.
Thus, whilst in reality he was gratifying a low ridiculous Pride, his Imagination had Force enough to introduce into his Mind a falfe Name for his Senfations; and consequently to give him more Food for his Vanity, more CauSe for exulting, and more Pleafure in the Contemplation of him-felf.
B u T I could not forbear Smiling at the Thought, that, whilst he was thus enjoying his own Perfedfions, I was placing him in my Fancy in GuUheP% Stead on the Brob-dignag's Table, to play Monkeyish Tricks, and be “ the Baby of a Girl,” or const-dering him held up in . the Air between the Finger and Thumb of one of thoSe Giants, whilst he was confidering what Sort of Animal he might be.

This
100 letter XXVIII.
This Scene ended in great Good-humour: Hortenfius walked out in the Afternoon, bought his WiSe a PreSent he could not afford; Sire was much pleaSed with itj (only as a Proof of his Love;) he looked on her Manner of receiving it, as a Mark of her Affe5iion for him ; and the Evening paffed in Mirth and PleaSantry: they mutually fed each other’s Vanity, and imagined it was all real Love. I went home well enough pleaSed; for, as they appeared happy, I did not want to open their Eyes, by which their HappineSs might have been leffened, and could not have been encreaSed.
Perhaps you may think this Scene very unnatural, after my first fetting out with ILortenfmf^ being a Man of Senfe, but he really is So, notwithstanding all I have told you : and, if you will confider it a little while, I believe you will find, that, where" Pride is strongly planted in the Mind, there is no Understanding will guard a Man from being Sometimes guilty of very great Follies ; and, altho’ Pride and Senfe are not often dear Friends, yet they do Sometimes
accidentally
LETTER XXVIII. loi
accidentally fall into each other’s Company; and whenever that happens, they pull Separate ways, till the Man, with whom they take up their Abode, appears as in-confistent, as iS he was poffeffed with a Legion of Follies. And this always brings to one’s Remembrance thoSe two Lines:
Who would not laugh^ if fuch a Man there be^ Who would not weep, if ^— were he ?
And, as a farther Proof of this Observation, in my next I will let you into a Scene I was yesterday Witnefs to j a Contrast in appearance to this I have been now describing, and yet the principal Adlor in it, was direded by the fame Pastion with lIortenfus.
But it is now too late to write more, for the Post will be gone, and I can never think the least Disappointment to my Friend, a Trifle.

letter XXIX.
•Camilla to Cynthia at Bath.
'	Cynthia,	[Fro/« London.
ITHANK you for the pictureSque Scene you displayed before my Eyes, in your Account of Hortenjiits and his Wife. I confeSs, the Judgment I at first formed of him, from what you fay of his Understanding, would not have led me to have guested what followed; but I find, that the continual Remembrance of his own good SenSe constitutes the chief Part of his PleaSure, and diat (odd as it may appear) in his Wife’s Polly he finds his own Wifdom, and fresti Opportunities every hour
of
LETTER XXIX. 103
of exerting what he is f leafed to think his Compajpon.
But let him be never So much mistaken in the Motives of his Conduct, as Good-humour and HappineSs are the ReSult from it, the Confideration, in my opinion, is not at all melancholy, altho’ I am better pleaS-ed, when I view another’s HappineSs built on the strong Foundation of Reality and Truth, than on the stippery Bottom of Fallacy and Deceit; becauSe in the latter Cafe, like Flights of the Imagination, one cannot tell how Soon it may fail, and the Foundation be destroyed; whereas in the former, like Solid ReaSon, the Basts is Sure, and must be lasting: and, as I know every freSh Instance of either the GoodneSs or HappineSs of your Fellow-Creatures is a new Pleafure to you, I will indulge my-Self in indulging you, and tell you the Story, or rather give you the Characters of Conjlantius and his Wife.
CONSrANTIUS^s Understanding and Good-nature are equally concerned in the directing every Action of -his G 4	Life
104 LETTER XXIX.
LiSe: He keeps up to the stridlest Rules of Honour in all his Dealings with Mankind; no one can Say he has ever injured them, but numbers, if they will Speak the truth, may Say he has taken opportunities of doing them good. He does many Adfions, other Men would think Sufficient to give them a Title to be called real Friends, only from a general Benevolence in his DiSpo-lition. This Inclination in the strongest manner leads him to Friendship, but hi* Understanding will not let him take falSe Objedts for true ones; and therefore he will not allow the many, who could gratify nothing but their Vanity by it, the Pleafure of thinking him their particular Friend. But Acts of Good-nature, instead of being any Expence to him, are his real Interest, as they are his chief Delight.
He is perfedtly free from all Seeds of Envy, and consequently of Malignity : indeed Some Objedls of Envy it is impoffible he should meet with, becauSe he cannot See any thing above him in point of Understanding; and therefore he can have no Temptation to wish to pull others down,
stnee
LETTER XXIX. 105
fince being upon a level with him is the utmost any Man can pretend to j but if the Seeds were in him, they might break forth against thoSe, who have in outward things the advantage over him. Such as Fortune, Grandeur, {ffc. But what is to me much more extraordinary, I don’t find he is much the Objedl of Envy to others: the only ReaSon I can give for it, is, that thoSe few, thoSe very few who can equal him, have the Same ReaSon for not envying him, as he has for not being angry with them; (for in Understanding, contrary to all other things, thoSe at the Top alone can bear to See Equals without thinking them Rivals) and other Men, from the great Distance vifible between him and them, despair to reach him; and therefore don’t attempt it, but rather chufe to prove their Senfe., in joining the general Cry and admiring him.
CONSrANTIUS is married, and even in this Point Pafiion did not get the better of his uSual JudiciouSneSs. He liked Fidelia., ’ds true, becauSe she is an Object worthy to be liked; but he did not chuSe
her,
io6 LETTER XXIX.
her, till he found her worthy to be loved: He is at once Satisfied with, and improves her Understanding, admires her PerSon, and loves her Heart 5 never contradicts her to shew only his Power; and, was she to defire any thing that would be a hurt to herSelf, he would have Resolution enough in that point only, to refist his own Inclination of indulging her. He is pleaSed with the Propriety of her Behaviour on all Occafions, not from the Dignity of having hh Wife do right, but becauSe he loves her too fincerely, to bear her doing wrong.
FIDELIA S vierypretty, and an unaffected SoftneSs in her Look and Manner throws a Lustre over all her Words and Actions. She has a very good Understanding, and, what is almost a Miracle, is throughly Satisfied with it, not from a vain Affectation, and believing it greater than it is, but becauSe she finds it enough to Satisfy the only Man she wishes to pleaSe; and, instead of defiring to impoSe any Fallacy on her Hushand, she, by his Instructions, improves herSelf to be in reality what 3	others
LETTER XXIX. 107 others only affect to be. Her Inclination to do whatever he delires, makes her Obedience So perfect, that she always Spares him the Pain it would cost him to deny her any Request : for, if she can but imagine any thing to be his will, she never hefitates a moment before she puts it in execution.
They may properly be Said to have chofen each other; becauSe, as she was the Object of public Admiration, she preferred him to many other Lovers, and, I doubt not, would have preferred him to all the world; and, as it is impoffible that many Women should have refuSed him, it is plain the Motive that determined his Choice, was real Love,
IF she Height of human HappineSs could be painted, Qonjiantius and his Wife should fit for the Picture. Thus, upon a folid Foundation, to love and esteem each other, and to give pleaSure to all around them (except Such, as from the Malignity of their own Hearts, don’t deServe to be pleaSed)
io8 LETTER XXIX.
is a Situation not to be eafily deScribed, and I leave it to your own Imagination.
But even Conjiantius does MiSchieS, not from any Defign, as you may SuppoSe from the Charadter I have already given of him, but as his Wit is much above the Com-prehenfion of the Multitude, and as it is impofiible to avoid Sometimes converSing with thoSe, to whoSe Capacities he cannot possibly lower himSelf, they miSunderstand every thing he Says; and, from an Ambition of being like him, form themfelves by the Sentiments they wifely 2iudi judi-doufly imagine he utters: for example, notwithstanding what I have already told you of his Behaviour to Fidelia, yet he will Sometimes in an ironical manner, be an Advocate for the Tyranny of Hushandsj So that I have known Men go home and abufe their Wives, for want of Capacity to enter into his real Meaning, and be-caufe they would not for the world be thought defective in any Mark of Good-SenSe.
I
LETTER XXIX. 109
I Am particularly acquainted with one Gentleman, who by mere accident now and then gets into Conjiantius's Company, and when he has heard him jocoSely Satirize ill-natur’d and moroSe DiSpofitions, he is Sure to take all his Satire for Approbation of thofe ill Qualities; and in all Companies, that he may not be wanting in the Character of WiSdom, which he affumes, he contradicts every Word his Wife fays, with a PJhaWy a meaning Shrug of the Shoulders.^ a muttering of Womens Polly, and every Sign of Contempt he can invent Or think of. The poor Woman is out of countenance, and does not know what to make of his Behaviour ; for, when his over-grown Underfanding does not intervene, he is a very good Hushand ; nay, at other times he is alfo a fond Father : but when this Fancy poffeffes him, if his Wife does but mention his Children, he is out of all manner of Patience, bids her hold her fooliSli Tongue, if she can find no better Subject of Converfation to entertain him with, than that of a Parcel of bawling Chits, not yet arrived at an Age, in which
the
110 LET TER XXIX.
the rational Faculties exert themSelves, and make them worthy to be thought on by Men of his SenSe.
CONSrANTIUS does not, nor cannot foreSee the ConSequence of what he has faid; and whilst from his Words the other Gentleman is ufing his Wife in this delicate manner for no Provocation, he and his Fidelia meet with Hearts reciprocally fill’d with Benevolence and Love, and give us one Proof, that real Happinefs is attainable, if purSued in the right Method.

Your Brother and your Cynthia are equally filled with Admiration and Esteem for them both; and could talk of nothing elSe the whole day we received your Letter. I wish it was in my power to tell you Something as pleafing; but, as I must relate things as I meet with them, and do not invent them, I will proceed to fulfil my Promise, in giving you an account of a Scene, a Contrast in appearance, altho’
really
112 LETTER XXX.
really arifing Srom the Same Motive with that I met with at the HouSe of Hortenfms,
The next Day I Spent at Leontine\; she is grave, tho’ chearful in his DiSpoSn tion ; he has an Understanding much above the greatest part of Mankind, tho’ it falls short of the few who are remarkable for their Genius; exprestes himfelf clearly on every Subjetst, but has not the Art of railing Images which are diverting, - or greatly entertaining : He is good-humoured when he is not offended; and does not plot MiS-chief, when he is diSpleaSed: Thus, whatever hurt he does others, either in his Words or Actions, it is owing to Some present Paffion, and not to any long-laid De-fign. This, in few words, is as much of shis Character, as I have been able to observe.
L EO NT I A, his Wife, is one of thoSe Women I really love and esteem. She has, without a regular Set of Features, a Countenance which at once displays the Good^ neSs of her Head and Heart, and makes her very pretty ; like a judicious Index to
A
LETTER XXX. 113
a well-wrote Book, her Looks must give every Beholder a Curiofity to read all the Sentiments contained in the Mind, oS which they only point the Heads in a lively and agreeable Manner. Her Understanding (for^ give the BoldneSs of the Metaphor) is as free from Art and Painting, as her Face, and consequently grows more amiable by a near and intimate Acquaintance: for the Woman, who from a strong Defire to be thought wife, and from a constant Flow of animal Spirits, vents in all Companies broken Scraps and confuSed Ideas which she has picked up from others, may raife an Appearance of an Understanding, and impoSe the Fallacy in general on the Injudicious ; but to thoSe, who are able to examine and judge of Things as they really are, her Conversation must be very foon as disagreeable, as the Face of an old Wo^ man is to thoSe, who fee her when the Paint is off, and her wrinkled Skin looks more dead, from having just before imitated the Bloom of Youth: for when the falSe Hair, Eye-brows and Teeth are laid by, the Objedl is justly turned into Ridicule, that can be So childishly vain, as to Von. II,	H	imagine
II4 LETTER XXX.
imagine Art has Force enough to Supply the Defects of Nature.
But to return to	Her very Man-
ner of fpeaking is a Proof, that, to give o-thers PleaSure, is her Motive to talk, and that neither a Love of Babbling, or a Pride in her own Parts, actuates her in the least; for fhe never raifes her Voice (as is common when People think, that if they deign to open their Mouths, they have a right to lilence others) when another has a mind to fpeak ; on the contrary, that is always a Reafon Sufficient for her to be filent. To which CauSe I impute her being So little known ; for as an Eagernefs to talk is not very uncommon amongst Mankind, and she never takes any pains to make a Show of her Understanding, it passes generally unregarded.
Nothing can be a more perfect Description of this agreeable Woman’s Conversation, than thoSe delightful Lines in L’he Love of Fame, the Univetfal Pajjion :
Naked
L E T T E R XXX. 115
Naked in nothing Jhould a Woman bcy But veil her very'Wii with Modesty : Let Man diScover; let not her difplay. But yield her Charms of Mind, with fweet DeLy.
\ N Short, whilst I was acquainted with Leontiay and had only now and then Seen her Hushand, I thought he must be the happiest Man in the World, in the poS-Sestion of a Wife with a Heart formed for all the Endearments of fincere unaffedted Love; with an agreeable PerSon, without the least Mixture of any thing mafculine or harsh, and withal a Head capable of making her a good Companion to Men of SenSe. But how was I deceived ! for Leon^ tine is unhappy from the very Caufe, from which I imagined his HappineSs must necessarily ariSe; and as lIortenJius enjoys his own Perfedtions by Seeing his Wife’s Folly, Leontine meets with a continual Disappointment to his Pride, in Leontia's vifible Su^ periority over him, which indeed he him-* felf goes no farther than to think an Equals z	lity;
ii6 LETTER XXX.
lity; but that is more than he can bear with any Patience.
1N the Morning our Conversation ran chiefly on Books, when Leotttid.s Observations were So judicious, and her Thoughts So noble and refined, that I could not help attending to her with a PleaSure I Seldom find in any Company; but all she Said Was with Such a DeSerence to her Hushand’s Opinion, and uttered with So much Modesty, that I expetsted him to be as much pleaSed with her, as I at first expedted the Day before, Hortettjim to be diSpleafed with his Wife : but I Soon found I was equally mistaken in both Cafes; for Lpntine grew fo four and peevish, that I^eontia was very uneaSy, without being able to gudfs by what Error (hidden even from her own Eyes) she had offended him.
M Y Eyes were opened by the Scene I had been Witnefs of the Day before ; and, altho’ I believe Leontine himfelf did not perfedlly know the Caufe of his Ill-humour, it was very vifible to me, that he was inwardly gnawed by that VulturEnvy,
and

and could not bear his WiSe should have So much SenSe and GoodneSs, as to make it utterly impoffible for him to gratify his Pride by her means. As he cannot uSe her better than she deServes, he can drag the Idea of no other Virtue to join to his best Behaviour, than barely not doing wrong,' This he thinks no CauSe for exulting, and therefore docs not care how ill he behaves to her; and, contrary to Hortenjius^^ who is pleafed in indulging his Wife in more than he can afford, Leontine never lets Le-^. ontia have the least Indulgence more than common Decency obliges him in his Station to allow her; and, whatever she has a mind to do, he Snatches greedily at the Opportunity to contradict her, always Saying, a Woman oj her Senfe should not he pleaSed, nor Set her Heart upon Trifles; that, if he had a foolish Wife indeed, he might indulge her like a Child, but a jirong Un-derfianding should be a Guard against all Levity.
Thus, under the pretence of paying her a Compliment, he is hoping that he fees, a Frailty in her, to let iri a glimmering H 3	Shadow

Shadow into his own Mind, of fome Su-periority in himSelfj and poor Ledntid. becauSe She is not a Fool, niust give bste of the strongest ProoSs irnaginable of Follyj namely, that of being above enjoyifig any of the AmuSements of Life, for feat of lessening her Dignity in the Eyes of others. She has as few Weaknesses as any Woman I ever knew, and it is very happy for her She has no more; for Leontine would vieiv them all in that magnifying Glafs, his own Pride, and Swell every Frailty into an unpardonable Fault.
I Could dbServe no Smile upon his Countenance, but he kept up an austere thoughtful Look till Dinner-time, when a Gentleman happened to come in, who has the Reputation of being a great Scholar: Leontine too has Learning, and, by now and then talking a Sentence in Greeks he contrived to put himSelf into a tolerable Good-humour; and I could plainly read in his Looks what passed in his Mind, and that he Said to himSelf with Joy and Rapture : Now I am Sure we talk Something my Wife doth not understand.” The Eng-
lijk
LETTER XXX. 119
lijh Dialogue, which preceded a Greek Senr tence, gave her a Guriofity to afk the Meaning oS the latter; when Leontine would not give the other Gentleman leave to Speak, but Said, that, altho’ he understood it very well in Greeks yet he could not explain it in Eng--lijh enough to convey the Idea to her and befides, it was above a Woman’s Understanding. And then he ran out into a long Harangue on the great USeleffneSs of Womens having any Understanding at all, except a Capacity to manage houshold Affairs, and obey their Hushands.
If the most exad: Oeconomy in her Family, joined to the utmost stridl Obedience, could Satisfy him, I am certain he must be Satisfied with Leontia ; but his Discontent ariSes from a CauSe she cannot remove, notwithstanding all ' she Suffers by it.
HI s Behaviour put an end to her Speaking any more ; and, if it had not been in compassion to her, I should have been diverted at the RidiculouSneSs of his Triumph. But she is really the Objed of Pity: thp H 4	Match
120 LETTER XXX.
Match between her and Leontine was made, when they were both very young, by their Parents, whq wifely took it into their heads, that, becauSe there had been a long Intimacy in their Families, their Children liiust be in love with each other j or, to Speak more properly, they blindly followed their own Huiiiour, without troubling their heads about their Childrens Love or HappineSs.
Thus they came together with no other Regard, but that of having no particular Distike to each other, and no Attachment to any other PerSon.
IF Leonti a had been left to herSelf, she certainly would not have made choice of Leontine; yet if she had chofe him above all the rest of Mankind, she could not have made him a better, a more obedient WiSe. It is a Subjedl too tender for me to mention to her; tho’ I am very certain, if she would have more Faults in her Con-dudt, he would have more Triumphs^ and consequently be much better pleaSed than
it
LETTER XXX. 121
it is poffible for him to be with her present unexceptionable faultleSs Behaviour.
L EO NT IN E has really, as one would imagine, too much SenSe to be So childish; and nothing but the Same Rea-fon that I gave you for ILortenJius\ Folly with regard to his Wife, can poffibly account for it. But to our forrow. Pride is a Weed the finest Soils are not free from, and if not watched and constantly rooted out, will overspread and choak every thing valuable they would otherwise produce. Something like this is very common a-mongst filly Men, but that Fools have Folly is not at all to be wondered at; and, if Accident joins them with Women of SenSe, tho’ their Conversation must be disagreeable, yet where nothing is expedted, the Disappointment is not great; and where two People meet, who are both filly and proud, Compaffion is Seldom more due to one Side than the other, for they must be reciprocal Plagues and Torments to one another for Life.
Now
122 LETTER XXX.
N 6 w I am upon this Subject, I cannot conclude, without telling you a ridiculous Instance of this kind, of a stupid Man, at whofe HouSe I dined about a Week ago. His Wife and Sister areboth very agreeable fenfibie Women, (how the former came to be married ta him, I cannot imagine) these Was a great deal of Company; the Lady of the Houfe intended we should retire to another Apartment, and leave the Men at the proper customary Time; but the Gentleman shewed Such a vifible UneafineSs all the while we were in the Room, and looked at his Wife, if he did but imagine she was going to Speak, with So much Ill-humour, that she was quite out of countenance, and rofe from the Table the moment the Cloth was removed.
About three days afterwards I met Lelius, who was one of the Company that day, and amongst other things in diScourSe, afk’d him, if they were very merry after %ve left them. He laughed, and told me, that the Gentleman who was fo impatient to be rid of us, the moment we were gone
out
LETTER XXX. 123
out of the Room, looked very happy, drank one Bumper of Wine, Said, “ Now the Women are gone, we may enjoy our-felves j” then fell fast afleep, and never fpoke a word afterwards.
You have often heard me mention Le^ Uus as one of the pleaSantest Companions in the world, and you may be Sure we must be merry on Such a Subject. We both concluded the Gentleman was only afraid, he should hear Something uttered by Women above his own Understanding, and, whilst he was in that Fear, could not Sleep in peace.

LETTER XXXI.
Camilla to Cynthia at Bath.
Dear Cynthia,
[From London.
IN return to your Account of Leontia and his Wife, and the fieepy Gentleman ; I will fend you the Story of a Lady, whom my Father introduced me to. She has a long time been an Acquaintance of his, and I was much pleafed with her Conversation ; but I observed a Settled Melancholy in her Countenance, that made me fear Some great Misfortune had befallen her in the CourSe of her Life. My HuS-band too obServed the fame thing, and defired me to endeavour to find out, if she
had
letter XXX. 125
had any Sorrow that could be in our power to relieve.
You may be Sure I took the first opportunity of obeying his Commands; and on the least Hint oS my Curiofity, the Lady began in the Words following to relate the History oS her Life.
“My Life has been a Blank, with the “ exception of one Instance only. My In-“ fancy pasted in the common way: My “ Parents had properly no Charadleristics “ at all; they married, becauSe Chance threw them in each other’s way, and “ lived together, becauSe it is customary. “ They were not ill-natur’d enough to ab-“ uSe their Children, nor fond enough to “ have any great Regard to their real In-“ terest or Happinefs. We were taught to “ read, write, dance, and play upon the ‘‘ Harpfichord, but entirely left to ourSelves, “ as to the Regulation of our Hearts, and “ forming our Sentiments.
When
126 LETTER XXXI.
“ When I was twelve Years old, my “ Mother died : My Father married again in a Twelvemonth ; for he had been ac-“ customed to that State of Life, and was “ then of an Age which brought with it fome Infirmities; and choSe to have in “ a Wife, at once a Companion and a NurSe. The Lady was much of his own ** DiSpofition j and confented to his Propo-‘‘ Sal, orfly becaufe She could not find in her “ heart to refuSe the Offer of a Hushand j and they led as quiet and stupid a LiSe, as the greatest PhiloSophers, with all their WiSdom and Dignity, can point out to their DiSciples.
“ My Sister and I were Sent to a Board-‘ ing-School: for we were only thought
■	troubleSome at home, and whilst my Father thought us Safe and out of harm's
■	way, he was contented. My Mother’s Fortune, which was 5000 /. was to be divided between us; but my Sister dying when she was Eighteen, the whole Sum devolved on me; and, what was very remarkable, I was fully Satisfied with
Q	“ it:
letter XXXI. 127
it: I did not So much as wish for more, only from a Defire to give it others; for to communicate Happinefs to my Fel-“ low-Creatures, was always the strongest " Pashon of my Mind.
“ T HI s at first perhaps may Sound vain “ to Say, but, as you earnestly defired me ‘‘ to give you the History of my Life, “ I think it neceffary, in order to make ‘‘ what I fay intelligible, to let you into my own DiSpofition; and to me it ap-“ pears a more foolish Vanity to endeavour “ to hide what Good we believe ourSelves “ pofiefied of, only in hopes the Imagi-“ nations of others may be warm enough to “ fet our Perfedlions in a fairer Light than they deServe, than to Speak honestly our “ own Thoughts of ourSelves. If there is any Good in my Nature, I am very ‘‘ fenfible I did not give it mySelf, and therefore humbly diredt my Thanks for “ it to the great God that made me.
“My Temper was calm and eafy> “ which made it difficult to be ruffled, y be'cauSe I had So perfect an Indifference
128 LETTER XXXI.
" in all Trifles which way I acted, that " had not my Love of pleafing my Com-" panions influenced me to comply with " their Inclinations, I Should have been " very apt to have funk into a State of " Indolence, from having no Motive to “ actuate me ; and yet I had very strong " Paflions: but then the Bent of all thofe “ Paflions was Love ; whether I was angry " or pleaSed, Love to the PerSon, who " caufed either the Anger or Pleafure in ‘‘ me, was the foie Motive, by which my " Mind W'-as influenced.
" With this DiSpofition, at Twenty Years of Age, I wa^ married to the Man in the World I really liked best; not becaufe he happened to be my only Lover, nor (as is commonly the cafe) did accidental Acquaintance make us fancy ourSelves in love with each other: no; he was a Man, whom, upon the most mature Deliberation my Age and Experience was then capable of, I thought poffeffed of every Quality capable of rendering my Life happy. He alSo choSe me freely, for he had no Parents to
confult;
LETTER XXXI. 129
conSult, and my Father, provided I did nothing to bring any DiSgrace upon my-Self or him, gave himSelf very little trouble about me. Befides, he had no reaSon to be against this Match; for, in point of Fortune, it was rather advantageous on my fide. This indeed weighed very little with me on any other Confide-ration, than as I thought it a Proof, that, as Love was the only Motive could induce him to make me his Choice, our Affections must be mutual, and our Love perfectly reciprocal.
‘‘Could now the warmest Imagination paint a ProSpeCt more fair, more likely to produce all the real Solid Enjoyments of Life ? Such Scenes of Harmony and Content poffeSTed my Mind, as is almost impoflible to defcribe. I in fancy run through all the Methods, in which I could Spend every Minute of my Time, and faw new Pleafures a-rifing every hour j I found the strong Motive of directing every Thought and Word, by an Endeavour and Hope of ' pleafing my Hushand, was capable of VoL.

‘‘If the Man I loved chofe to live “ in the Hurry of the World, I ima-“ gined I Should be there furnished with “ continual new Observations, to render my Conversation agreeable to him. If “ Retirement was what he most de-“ lighted in, I fancid every Flower in the “ Garden, every wild Beauty of the Field; “ in short, all the different Objedts in Na-“ ture, which at once give us an Idea of “ Variety and Harmony, would be butfo “ many Pidlures of my own Mind, where “ the Refult of every various Thought “ would be Content and Concord, and all, liSie the Produdtions of Nature, have “ Reference to one great End only.
But
L E T TER XXXI. i^t
“ But how was I mistaken! All things turned out quite contrary to my Ex-pedation, and I have been miserable from the Time, whence I hoped to hav’"e dated my HappineSs; and from a CauSe, which, till I have explained myfelf, you will imagine utterly im-^ poffible, and think me mad for mentioning it : namely, becauSe my Huf-band will not distinguish the Effeds of that Passion, which is unSullied by Vanity, unmixed with any thing but itfelf, from fuch Effects as constantly attend Paffions made up oS very different Ingredients; and in forming which (notwithstanding any Appearance they may make to short-fighted Eyes) real Love has the least Share. I cannot treat him with Contempt, becauSe 1 love him; and he takes that Treatment to ariSe from Contempt, which is the Effed oS Affedion. He has numberlefs good Qualities, but the Strength of his Paf-fions caufes him to be Sometimes unreasonable, and the Force of his Imagination helps him to endeavour to bend I 2	“ and
132 LETTER XXXI.
“ and warp even Truth itSelf to his own “ Justification. But, as Truth and Error “ are So very distindt, that it is impossible ever to make them join, I cannot help “ Suffering the utmost UneafineSs, when “ I See him labouring and fatiguing him-“ Self, to drag the Solid Weight of Rea-“ fon, to meet the light Feather of De-“ ceit; whilst it would be fo much easser “ for him to blow away the latter with “ the fmallest Breath, than in the least “ to bend the former, had he the Strength “ of ten thoufand Hercules's.
“ Wh E N E V E R he has a mind thus to “ impofe upon himSelf, he brings to my “ Remembrance a Story I heard when I was a Child, which, altho’ only told to “ Children to amuSe them, I think is a “ good Fable, and may be applied to the “ Treatment Mankind in general give their “ own Minds.
“In this Story there is one Man, who “ is wife enough to dig all Night in the “ Earth for Day-light, fancying by that “ means he Shall obtain it j and another
“ who
letter XXXL 133
“ who drags a heavy Cow up to the Top “of a HouSe, to eat a little withered “ GraSs, which he Sorgot there • was any “ other means of coming at.
“ Now, when I See the Man whom I “ So much languish to find in every re-“ Sped the greatest Object of Esteem, thus “ vainly digging for Day-light, in the “ dark Gloom of the Earth; or drag-“ ing a great Cow up a HouSe to eat “ a little GraSs; whilst others, from their “ Good-nature and Benevolence, laugh, “ and are pleafed at his Mistake, I can-“ not help, altho’ in the Softest Terms, “ hinting, that with a little Patience, and “ by turning his Eyes upwards, the broad “ Day-light of Truth would break in “ upon him, and Save him the trouble of “ digging any longer in Mud and Dirt for “ what is not there to be found ; or that, “ if he would fend and cut down that GraSs, “ which at a distance appears to him So fine and fit for Nourishment, he would find it withered and good for nothing, “ mere TraSIr not worth any pains.

Dear Camilla,	[From Bath.
IH A V E a very great Compafiion Sor the Lady, whoSe Story you Sent me, and can perSedtly understand what she must feel, in living Seven Years with a Man she loved ; who, blinded by his own Pashons, would not understand her real Charafter, nor Suffer her to treat him as a reaSonable Creature. Had not I been So happy, as to meet with your Brother, this might very likely have been my own Fate; and the Idea of it is So horrible, that I think it is the only Misfortune in life, which it would have been impoffible to have fupported.

144- letter XXXII.
Was my Valentine capable of treating the meanest Creature in the world in a Manner I could not justify in my own Mind, his indulging me even to Adoration, would make me no Amends; nay, on the contrary, I should be only the more unhappy: for the Racer, who is distanced within Sight, and almost within Reach of the Goal, feels a great deal more UneafineSs than he, who, being thrown out at first, immediately despairs, and leaves the Race.
What the Lady Says of TenderneSs, is, in my opinion. So very true, that the palpable Mistake most Men lie under in confounding it with Pride, is an evident Proof to me, that they Set up their PaS-stons for Judges in a Cafe, where ReaSon alone can distinguish; and, if People would give themfelves leave to fee clearly but for a minute, and be honest enough to Speak the Truth, we should hear many a perSon own it, and Say; " I always argue with my-“ Self thus:—Pride is a bad Passion, and “ TenderneSs a good one ;—but, I am ‘‘ So perfect a Creature, and So constantly

in the right, that, whatever hurts me, must be a Fault in another ; and there-Sore, that Behaviour in a Woman, with which I am diSpleaSed, must ariSe Srom Pride, a Vice my own Mind is totally free from, and not from Tendernefs, a Virtue I have So large a share of: — As indeed what Virtue is there, which I do not poffefs in the highest Degree ?
N o w a Man, who has an Imagination warm enough thus to raife a Phantom of his own Goodnefs, and then to embrace it as a Reality, must look with Hatred or Contempt on every one, who cannot be equally deceived with himSelf. But it is a melancholy Confideration to me to find, how very difficult it is to come at Happi-nefs, when a Woman, who married the Man she really loved, and where she had the greatest steaSon to believe her HuS-band’s Love equal’d hers, could be miserable ; which is, I think, the Cafe of the Lady, of whom your last brought me an Account. Tho’ I am like her in Some Hopes, that Time will make him fee the Truth ; if he has a strong Understanding,. VoL. II.	K	I

I am certain, he will not Sor ever contb nue in Such an Error, as to take Pride Sot Love ; for a Man of Senfe can no more be at home in a Fool’s ParadiSe, than a Broh-dingnagmn can live in a Lilliputian Palace.
I Am not at all Surprized at the Con-fufion in most Families, arifing from preposterous Matches ; for, notwithstanding it is generally believed, that v/here there is no Force from Parents, nor any Views of Fortune, Women marry the Men tj^ey like, yet there is nothing So uncommon j for Vanity, in Some Shape or other, is the Motive that induces most of them to ehuf» their Hushands.

How would poor Lelius stare, to find all the fancied Friendship, which he imagined Leila had for fo many Years daily improved, by his kind Indulgence to her, in a moment fwallowfed up by a Passion for a Beau ? and to fee her Eyes and Heart entagled by a laced Coat on the Back of a Coxcomb, who, far from returning her Love, would play Tricks, and expofe her to all Companies by impertinent Sneers, and ridiculous affected Witticifms ?

IN short, Ovid.s Imagination in his Me-^ tamorphofes never made more unaccountar ble Changes, than would appear thro’ fuch a Tell-truth Mirrour: Men would be in one moment unmarried from Wo^ rnen, who, they fancied, would have broke their Hearts to have parted from them, and married again the next to others, that shey had never the least notion were even capable of loving them : and, I am afraidj fome Men of Senfe, who are now most contended for, would on a Sudden find great difficulty in meeting with any Wife at all.

Your whims, as you are pleaSed to call them, gave me great Entertainment ; nay, I may Say, that when you give l^eiSure and Happinefe as the Reafons for them, that Confideration brought me the highest PleaSure imaginable.
I Read your Letter to my Hushand: He quite grieved at Some part of it, especially where So many Ladies are in love with ZiOthario : I was forced to put him in mind continually, that it was only a Scene of Imagination, to keep him from being melancholy.

A Lady of my Acquaintance, whdSe Name is Berinthia., Sent me the following Novel • and as I am always pleafed with every Opportunity of amufing dear Cynthia^ I hope it will have the defired Effect*
A novel.
ID E L IN DA was born of a Gentleman’s Family, and in her earliest Jn^ fancy educated as became a young Girl of Fortune; but her Parents both dying in the thirteenth Year of her Age, She was left in thoSe tender Years, after having been hitherto too tenderly brought up, to the wild World, without any means of Support; for her Father arid Mother had for a long time lived in a manner they could not' Support; and made it their only view to conceal their Poverty, instead of prudently endeavouring to remove it: by which means they kindly left this So much dreaded Discovery of their penurious Circumstances to break out with all its Weight and Horror, when the poor Belindn, their only dear Child, must feel alone its Burthen. And
thus
is8 LETTER XXXIII.
thus in the midst of her unaffetsted AS stidtion Sor the LoSs of her Parents, did their mercileSs Creditors Seize on every thing they died posteffed of.
BELINDA'^ Heart, young as ssie then was, felt her first LoSs too strongly, to let any outward Circumstances, for the present, add much to her inward Grief She Could eafily diSpenSe with the Delicacy Ihe had been uSed to be treated with; for in the first Agonies of her Sorrow, she was very carelefs of what became of her.
H owEVER, this poor yoting Creatiire had an Aunt by the Father’s fide, who had that Compaffion for her which she wanted for herfelf, and took her into her Pro-tedtion: And although her Situation was fuch, that she could by no means propofe to provide for her in the manner she wished, yet she was refolved to uSe her utmost En-deavours to preServe her from the deplorable Fate that generally attends Youth and Beauty when in distreSs. And in order to com-pafs this her laudable Defign, she treated the young Belinda in fuch a manner, that
notwish-
LETTER XXXIII. 159
notwithstanding the Difference of their Ages, She never Scrupled to own to her the Dictates of her Heart.
When Belinda was fifteen, her Youth and Beauty gained her many Admirers; but Such was the Force of her Education, joined to her own natural good DiSpofition, that She looked on Treachery with So great a Detestation, that she fixed a Reshlution, that no Offers, though ever So advantageous, should tempt her to give her Hand, without the Goncurrence of her Heart.
Her Heart had neither Levity enough to like every Man who came in her way by accident, only becaule he complimented her ; nor did her Head contain Folly enough to fancy every time she was amufed, that she was in love. She judged rightly, that she might be very much pleafed with the Gaiety of a Ball, where every thing Seems contrived to raife and delight the Imagination, without being in love with her Partner; aifd knew tlie Qualifications requifite to make her happy, and gain Esteem too well, to let a temporary Gomplaifance and Good-
Humour
i66 L E T T E R XXXIII.
Humour make her immediately form ani Schemes of being totally in a Man’s powei for Life. She fpoke her Sentiments to her Aunt on all Occafions freely, and without referve, who encouraged and applauded her for fo doing:
BELINDA lived on happily with her good Friend, till She Was twenty Years of age; when, happening to dance one Night at a Neighbour’s Houfe with a young Gentleman who was just returned from his Travels, She was fo much pleafed with him. She could think of nothing elSe till She had feen him again. Accident threw her often in his way; and She could hot guard herSelf from being feized with one of thofe violent Passions of Love that poS-feffes the whole Mind, and leaves no room for any other Objedt; At first She grew penfive and melancholy, and was fo changed in her whole manner, that She was hardly the fame Woman. Her Aunt, who knew a great deal of the World, and was Satisfied that, as She continued her Good-neSs to her, no fudden Misfortune had befallen her, foon guessed the CauSe of this
Change,
L E T T E R XXXIIl. i6i
Change, and by PerSuafions prevailed on her not to begin now to conceal herThoughts from her.
BELINDA at first was unwilling to difcoyer her Pafiion, even to her kind Pro-tectreSsnot that She was afraid to let her know her most inmost Thought: in reality She Was astiamed to difcloSe it. But how was this good Woman grieved, when Be-linda named Philander as the Objetst of her Love ! for She knew he was married, whilst he was abroad, to a youiig Lady with whom he was very much in love. However, she thought proper not to conceal from Belitida^ that her Lover was j?iarried, as she must know it in the end, and in the mean time might, by indulging it, increafe her Paffion. When Belinda heard that her first Affedion must be difappointed, she could not help fighing, and being grieved at her hard Fate, that she should fix her Heart, though un-Sollicited, on the Man whole Honour and Duty forbad him to return her Love ; and at the fame time found it impossible to have the least Inclination for any amongst the Number of thoSe who purfucd her V o L. II.	L	with
i62 LETTER XXXIIL
with the utmost Assiduity and Endeavours to pleaSe her.
But Such was the GoodneSs oS her Heart, that She reSolved, whatever it coft her. Philander should be no Sufferer by her Passion ; and she took Such uncommon chimerical Fancies into her head, as would Scarcely be believed by the generality of thoSe who are in love. For she often Said, that wheti Love made a Woman adl as if she hated, and to contrive by all manner of means and cunning Tricks to undo and ruin the Man on whom she placed her Affection, she Could not wonder if Hatred was returned for fuch Love.
P MILANDER too had strange Whim-fies in his Brain; for though Beliftda's Love was too apparent for him to be ignorant of it, yet he never endeavoured to take advantage of her Paffion, to betray her to Mifery; nor, on the other hand, would he shock her, by rudely flighting her; but behaved in every thing in the manner he thought would make her most eafy, imdet that most difagreeable Circumstance of being
over-
LETTER XXXIII. 163“
t)verwhelmed with a Passion she had no hopes of gratifying.
PHIL AN DER did not stay long in England; but as Soon as he had Settled Some BufineSs for which he came over, he went to his beloved Wife, and left poor Belinda to figh at his AbSence, though at the fame time she applauded his Behaviour. He stay’d five Years abroad, all which time Belinda retained her Love; and. yet never once wished the Objedt of it might be poi-foned or massacred, or come by any other Such /light Misfortune, although he could not return it.
PHI LANDER'S Father was very fond of him during his Mother’s Life-time ; but she died whilst he was abroad; and her Hushand, although he was at first very much concerned for her LoSs, did not long remain a Widower, but married a young Lady, of whoSe Beauty he became enamoured at first fight, and whoSe want of Fortune made her not inflexible to his Addresses.

This
164. letter xxxiii.
This Lady’s Gratitude to her Hushand for generoufiy forgetting all mercenary Views for her fake^ railed in her fuch a prodigious Fondneis towards him, that fhe could not bear to Share either his Affe<stioii or his Fortune with his Son; but conljFifved a Method of ingroffing all the former, and fpending the latter,, to fitpporthis Dignity; fo that, when hedied^ he left: his Circumstances in fuch a Situation, that poor Philander was reduced to the utmost Necessity. He immediately brought his Wife to En^-lattdy to endeavour to make the best of the very little that was left.
Near about the time that Philander lost his Father, Belinda was deprived of her Aunt, who left her every thing she was worth, amounting in all to upwards of eight thoufand Founds ; for finee she took Belinda to live with her, a Relation had lest her a confiderable Sum, which enabled her to provide So handSomely for her Neice. She heard of Philander*^ Misfortunes, and yet was fo strangely fanciful, that altho’ her Rival was involved in her Hushand’s
MiSery,
LETTER XXXIIL 165
yet was the romautick Belinda
far from rejoicing at it, that She employed all her Thoug-hts how She could relieve them: Nay, So very far did Slie carry thefo odd Notions of her’s, that Slie a^ually contrived out of her own Fortune to Support them, whilst they themfelves were ignorant from whence came their Continual Supply • and She was mad enough to part with what was her own to the Man She loved, even tho’^ he Shared it with another Woman.
This lasted for three Years, when PhL lander lost his Wife. He was at first almost inConSolable; for he had lived with her in the utmost FondneSs; and no wonder he Should regret Such a Woman, for she truly deServed his Esteem. At length. Time and PhiloSophy calmed his Mind, and he began to be tolerably eafy, when by an accident he difcoVered v^hence had flowed all his Support Since his Father’s Death. Astonished and confounded with Belinda's GoodneSs, his first Thought was immediately to throw himSeif at her Feet, and declare himSelf her Lover; but then he apprehended that it would be an ill Re-L 3	turn
i66 letter XXXIII.
turn for all her Generofity, to defire her to marry a Beggar. Then again, as he knew her Love for him, he imagined that she, by being his Wife, would compleat her Happinefs, and confequently, that he ought to make that his first Confideration. The ReSult of thefe Refietstions occafioned his writing her the following Letter.
A	PhilANDER
B E L I N D A.

When BeIkA^ received this Letter, she read it ov^ Several times with Such a perturbation of Mind, that it, w^as Some time before she could calm, her Thoughts enough to make room, for Refiection; and then So strangely whimstcal was her Head, that she .was. more perplexed than ever. Here was a plain Ostec of Marriage from. PhiJa?td£r; and yet So unaccountable 'vyu’e her Whims, that she thought it ^ojjible to

She did not doubt of PhilaudeP% Sincerity ; for her Esteem for him had been long fixed. To Speak the truths it was twin- born with her Love. One Hour gave them birth ; and their very Existence depended on each other’s Destiny.

iH LETTER XXXIII.
BELINDA formed in her Mind another Picture oppofite to that of MiSery^ which Ihe had drawn in her Letter; in which She indulged herfelf in the Thoughts of the great Happinest of her future Life, should PhilandeP^ Love be equal with her own ; and theSc two Pictures placed them-felves by turns before her Imagination: When she faw her Lover, that of Happi* nefs was preSent; when he was abSent, Refledlion would Sometimes teaze her with producing the other to her Fancy. However, file had not converSed with Philander very often, before all Ideas of the Possibility of Mifery with him were So intirely banished her Thoughts, that file conSented to depend for the rest of her Life intirely on him for her HappineSs.
But Belinda carried on her romantick Notions even after fiie was married; for file was more fearful of lofing Philander (that is, lofing his Astedion) now than before: while he, on the other hand, by the Sincerity of his Love and the Good-Nature of his Behaviour, made it the
BufineSs
LETTER XXXIII. 175
FufineSs oS his LiSe to banish all Fears frorn her BoSom, and let nothing but Joy inhabit there.
PHILANDER had two Children by his former Wife, whom Belinda treated with the fame Tendernefs as if they had been her own ; and when she became her-Self a Mother, if her Heart knew any difference, the Children, by her Behaviour, could never perceive it; and by this Education they were So little ufed to distinguish between Own-Brothers and Brothers-in-law, that they were united in Love; and the HappineSs of the whole Family were centered in each other: And this Union was every day in created, till they became the Admiration of all, whoSe Good-Fortune it was to be of their Acquaintance, and they might properly be styled Lie Family of Love.
BERINTHIAy when she lent me this Novel, Said she only defired me to read it to laugh at it j for that she thought the defigned Heroine of it was of So very unnatural

Cynthia to Camilla at London.
Camilla,	[Fro;;; Bath.
I A M obliged to you, for making my AmuSement your first Confideration on every Occafion, and tbank you for your Novel 5 and, as you defire my Opinion of it, I Shall Speak my Thoughts freely, as I always do, when I am converfing with Camilla.
I Admire and love Philander: his Behaviour to Belinda from the first, de-ferves the utmost Approbation. No Coquette in the midst of her monkey Tricks, can be half So contemptible, as a Man VoL. IL	M	who
i>78 L E T T E R XXXIV.
who endeavours to turn into Ridicule the Woman he plainly perceives likes him. Had Belinda met with a Coxcomb, how many pretty Inventions would he have found to have worked her Passions, in order to have made her contemptible.
I Remember my being at a Ball when I was very young, where I Saw a Scene between a Coxcomb and his Partner which fpr a long time made me very un-eaSy. That Celia (for that was the Lady’s Name) liked her Spark, I really believe; and his Intentions to put her out of countenance, and to Shew the Company that she liked him, are almost incredible : he contrived Methods of continually raissng in her the uneaSy SenSation of Shame, and, with an impertinent Stare, he would often iuddenly afk her, why She bluSh’d ? This, tho’ She was as pale as Death before, always made her as red as Scarlet: What Triumph was this to a Man that he had made a Woman bluSh ? Then, when by her ConSufion her Voice faultered, and she found a Difficulty to pronounce her Words; ‘‘ Oh! undoubtedly, fays he. Ladies must
“ liSp!
E Er T T E R XXXIV. 179. “ lisp l-—’Tis' pretty to talk like the Vul-« gar !-^What would be the Signification “ of Bestuty^ unlefs Affedlation was allow-“ able with it!'
GEL IA Was naturally'a Sprightly Sen-fibie Wortian, and could very eafily have made ten Such Coxcombs the Jest of the Company, had not Shame taken from her the Powct of Utterance : however at last, provoked' with his Ufage, and enraged with his Impertinence, She recollected her Scattered Thoughts, and Suddenly led this triumphal Conqueror _ to a great Peer-GlaSs at the lower End of the Room, and afked him; when he Saw his own Figure, whether he could wonder at any Woman’s liking hirh: altho’ he had been endeavouring all the Evening to make a Jest of her for it, yet she hoped, on the Confideration how impoffible it must be to behold him without loving him, that for the future he would not uSe fo many Endeavours to make her ridiculous for it.
The Gentleman was So struck with this Sudden Turn, that he could not com-M 2	mand
i8o L E T T E R XXXIV.
mand his Temper enough, to make her any reasonable AnSwer, but hammered out two or three Words (undoubtedly very kind ones) in So low a Voice, that he could not be heard. The whole Company immdediately took the Defign, joined with Celia in her just Revenge, and all at once burst into a HorSe-laugh in his Face: One oS the Company whiSpering him, what Sorceries he had made uSe of, to bewitch Celia?—Another Softly telling him, he ought to be hang’d for a Wizard; with much more Raillery of the like kind, which the Fear of offending Celia confined to Whifpers. This fo incenSed him, that ready to burst with Spite and Anger, and unable to bear being So justly expoSed as the Objedl of Contempt, he left the Room, and the next day departed from the Town ; I hope as much cured of his JVity as Celia was of her Love.
I W A s much pleaSed, that Celia had Resolution enough to turn the Scorn and Ridicule on the Perfon who fo justly de-
Served
LETTER XXXIV. i8i
Served it, and not to let Such a trifling vain Coxcomb triumph over her.
H ow unlike was this filly low Fellow to your Philander., whoSe Gratitude Seems to equal Belinda's Generofity; and yet I confeSs, I do not blame Belinda Sor her Fears, for that Pitsture of MiSery Slie draws in her Letter, fills me with Horror. It is a bold Adventure to give another Such full Power over us; which is always the Confequence, when we live with a PerSon, whoSe every Word and Look can distradl the Soul, and rent the Heart aSunder.
I See nothing unnatural in Belinda's Charadler, tho’ I am afraid it is a very uncommon one; but at the Same time think it far from being monstrous ^ and, instead of wondering that there are Some few Instances of the like Behaviour, I am only amazed, that they are not more frequent: For to me nothing appears more unreasonable, than that a Woman should defire to tear out a Man’s Eyes, only be-cauSe he cannot give her his Heart.

ally have executed, had she not been prevented by a mere Accident.
But Instances oS this Sort of Love are So numerous, that we hardly live a day, without hearing Some new Stories of this kind. If an Inhabitant from any other World, where ReaSon Sway’d, and Fallacy had no power, was to make us a Vifit, and be told Some of theSe Stories, and at the fame time was to be informed, that we gave the Name of Love to Paffions which produce Such dire Effeds; what an Idea would he have of our Understandings ?
Now, Camilla., let me intreat you in one point to take my Advice; on no account be intimate with the Lady who thinks Belinda to be an unnatural and monstrous Charader. With Observation we may diScover most Peoples Minds, by the Sentiments which their Mouths utter; and when any Woman avows the Dishelief or Impoffibity of GoodneSs, and can assert; with Warmth, that Belinda is a Monster in Nature, you may be very Sure, that she at, M 4	least

least is no fuch Monjler: and I dare imagine, that, if the Lady who gave you that Novel, in hopes you would laugh at Belin-^ da^ was in the Same Circumstance, she would, instead of fupporting her Lover and her Rival, stick at nothing to do them a mifchief. I wiSh you would endeavour to find out the Lady’s History, and let me know it,
I S p E N T the Afternoon yesterday in a great deal of Company, with whom I Should have been very well pleaSed, had it not been for a Critic, who would not fuffer any one to Speak, without declaring whether it was a good or., bad thing that was Spoken: He Seem’d in all he Said to intimate, that no one ever Spoke without a Defign of being witty; by which I did fuppofe, that being witty was the Study of his own Life; altho’ if So, the poor Man was very unfortunate, for no one ever failed more in the Attempt.
A T last a Gentleman by accident told a Story; that he had contracted a great Friendship with a Man, only from hearing
Qf
LETTER XXXIV. 185
of a particular kind of Behaviour of his in a Fever: “ For, continued the Gentleman, “ my Friend was a great Lover of Cyder, “ and always took care to keep the best “ in his HouSe that he could purchaSe: Now, when he was So ill, that the Phy-ficians forbad him to drink any himSelf; “ whilst he was restleSs, and raging with ‘‘ the Thirst of a burning Fever, he got a “ Set of his Friends to drink it round him, that the feeing them pleaSed, might “ communicate Some Pleafure to him. I “ was fo delighted with this Instance of the “ uncommon Love of Seeing others pleaSed, “ that I contrived Soon to get acquainted “ with him, and have sheen very intimate “ with him ever fince; till I have found, “ that his chief Delight in life, is in either making or feeing others happy.”
W E, all but the Critic, agreed with the Gentleman, in his Opinion of the Story ; but he fell into a great Passion, faid it was a very bad thitig^ and that it would have been much more natural, if he had thrown the Cyder in his Friends Face, for attempting to drink that in his Prefence,

Cynthia, [Fro/« London.
Your communicating of your Sentiments on Belinda'^ Story, was to me great Indulgence, as they exactly corresponded with my own; and I am always pleaSed to find, that we Sympathize in our Thoughts, and agree in our Notions.
i W A s much diverted with Celia*% having Resolution enough to daunt the impertinent Coxcomb, who took Such pains to put her out of countenance; as Such Behaviour deServedly makes a Man the Object of Contempt and Ridicule \ and nothing
i88 LETTER XXXV.
thing is more just, than to punish that Vanity, which wants to be indulged at another’s Expence.
You may be certain, Cynthia^ that the moment I was informed of your Cu-riofity to know Berinthid.s Story, I made it my Bufinefs to enquire and find it out; and luckily fpending an Hour or two yesterday in the Afternoon with a Lady, who, on my mentioning her, faid, that fhe was formerly of her Acquaintance; I afk’d her fo many Questions concerning Berinthia^ that at last fhe Said, she believed I wanted to know every Adion of Berinthid.% Life from the time she was born. I replied, it was true, that I had a Curiofity to know Berinthid.% Story j then the Lady Said, she had known her from her Infancy, and would relate all she knew of her, if I defired it; and on my Saying, nothing could oblige me more, she began as follows.
“ When Berinthia was eight, and I “ was Seven Years of Age, we went to the fame School. As we were confiderably y younger
LETTER XXXV. 189
younger than any of the rest of the Scholars, we naturally kept much together, and were constant Companions. I have ever had a good deal of Fond-neSs in my Temper; and, as the Bent of Nature diScovers itSelf very early, I even at that time had a great FondneSs for Berinthia: but no fine Lady who is adored by a Man to whom she is per-fedlly indifferent, can treat her Slave with more Inhumanity, than she did me. I gave her every thing in my power; I preferred her in all things to my-felf, and omitted no Opportunity of endeavouring to pleaSe her, but all in vain; for she Saw her Power, and would deign to treat me no otherwiSe, than as her Slave. I was pashonate, and when she uSed me ill, could not help bursting into rage, at which she with great Good-' nature would always laugh, and try to ' exaSperate me, till I could hardly re-' frain from beating her. This was her ' daily AmuSement and Diverfion. I have ' cryed whole days at her Cruelty to me, ' and yet she would never do any thing
“ to
190 L E T T E R XXXV.
“ to make me eaSy, for that she thoaghf “ too meani and Iquite unbecoming a Pd-
Son of her Dignity. If any/of the bigger' “ Girls took any notice of me, she Was'
fo angry at it; that she was fare to find '‘ out Some ; Method, of revenging it on " me. To fome of them findeed she was “ very obfequbus; but I have fince re-" fiected, it was only to thofe, who told " her she was pretty, or in any manner " praifed her; for she never regarded any “ one the shore for doing her any real “ Kindnefs.
“ Bu t I will dwell no longer ontMs “ Part of her Life, nor should I have “ Said So much of it, but only as I think “ her Behaviour even then Was' a strong “ Indication of her future Condudf, and to “ shew you how early People act in Cha-“ racter.
“ We came from School, when I “ Thirteen; and, as we lived very near “ each other till I was Fifteen, we con-“ tinned our Correspondence. But now it “ was impofiible it should last long; for 3	“
LETTER XXXV. i^i
that Envy, which fhe. could not- con-“ tain, even when any of my School-“ Fellows , took notice of me, now I be-came of an Age to be obServed by Men, “ burst forth like a Torrent, overleaping “ all Bounds.
“ Sun had her share of Admirers, but that would not content her; the moment any Man appeared to have the least Liking to me, she fancied herSelf in love with him, for she never, examined herfelf; and, when she was un-eaSy that she was not flattered, she immediately imagined it was fruitleSs and unreturned Love gave her that Uneafi-neSs: and it is incredible how many artSul Tricks she made uSe of, to in-groSs all the Men to herSelf. Some new Lye was the Tax I paid for every new Lover; and when she had Spread abroad theSe her own Inventions, she constantly came and told them me with great Anxiety for my Good; was greatly grieved, that People fliould be So wicked, as to give themSeves the Liberty of thus cenSuring others without
[92 LETTER XXXV.
‘ a CauSe, and then gave me Some friend-' ly Advice, to behave in the very man-‘ ner. She knew would to the World ‘ corroborate the Story. A Train oS Gun-^ Powder, when once lighted, cannot Saster ' catch the Flame, than Scandal Spreads, ^ when managed by an artful Incendiary j ' and, as Berinthia had herSelflaid the ' Train, She must know best where first ' to kindle it.
“ Several fleepleSs Nights and rest-' leSs Days have theSe Stories given me;
' for I was young, and every time I heard ' I was thus defamed, fancied I was un-' done. I had not then confidered, that
■	Truth, like the Sun, tho’ clouded by
■	Envy, and eclipSed with Spite and Ma-' lignity, will in the end break forth and ' Shine with all its natural Lustre.
“At last by an accident I discovered all Berinthia!% Treachery: You maybe certain, I no longer then converSed with her, altho’ she played over all her Arts to induce me not to abandon her. She wept and Swore, and stuck at no FalSe-
‘ ‘ hood
LETTER XXXV. 193
hoods that could give her the least glim-niering hopes of still dveceiving me; but it was all in vain, for I never would Speak to her afterwards; and in a Small time, to my great Joy, she left the Neighbourhood, and fixed at the other End of the Town : there she got acquainted with the young Olinta^ who was fincereand artleSs in her DiSpofition, not in the lest apt to fuSped others ; tender in her Heart, and open and un-reServed in her Behaviour.
‘‘ This Was the very Character that Seemed formed by Nature for Berittthia to exercife her Talents on. You know she can be very agreeable, when she has a mind to recommend herfelf; and her Assiduity to oblige this her new Eriend^ Soon deceived the poor innocent Oliva^ who imagined she was as fond of her as she professed. This was the greatest Joy irriaginable to Berinthia; for a Friend is no lefs necessary to the corn-pleating the HappineSs of thofe Minds that delight in Treachery, than to the heightning the Pleafures of thofe bene-VoL.

“ OLIVA was not at all Coquette in her Humour, and therefore had not a Variety of Followers, for Berinthia to “ pratstice her Skill on; but in Lorenzo “ she had one accepted Lover, whom Ihe ‘‘ defigned Soon to make her Hushand.
“ LORENZO was a Man, whova-“ lued himfelf greatly on his Prudence, “ and studied the Pashons of others with the noble Defign of turning them to “ his own Advantage, without any Con-“ fideration what they Suffered by it. He knew well the Secret Springs of the hu-“ man Mind; and could, whenever he “ thought proper, make ufe of that Know-“ ledge, to rack and torment it; and yet “ he would have wondered at the Cruelty ‘‘ of a Tyrant, who should study Anato-“ my, with a Defign only of finding “ out in what manner he could best con-“ trive'to rack and torture the Bodies of “ Men.
“ OLIVA
LETTER

“ OLIVA was very handSome : Lo-> renzo liked her PerSon, andj as her Fortune was full as much as he could ex-pedl with a Wife, he thought it would be more prudent in him to marry her, than to think of her in any other light y but if he had not thought it prudent^ he would hrave fcorned to have let her Happinefs or MiSery have the least Weight in his Determinations.
“As foon as Berinthia found out on what Terms Lorenzo vifited Oliva, she was refolved to contrve Some Method oS getting him away from her: and the first Invention she hit upon, was writing him a Letter, in which there were many dark Hints about Oliva's Conduct, as if she had been guilty of Something, of which he was ignorant, that, if known to him, would certainly make him change his Mind. Every Sentence was was intermixed with great Expreshons of TenderneSs for the Reputation of young Ladies, and strong Affcr-tions, that nothing but the Fear that a N 2	“ Man
96 LETTER XXXV.
Man of his Understanding Should be drawn in to do an imprudent Adion could pofiibly have induced her to write this Letter. Then she begs him not to believe any thing against Olwa without strong Proof: for there were So many Lies told in the World, it was very difficult to come at the Truth, and it would be terrible to let poor Oliva Suffer from Calumny.
“ This Letter was figned from an unknown Friend. Lorenzo was startled at the Receipt of it. The Thoughts of being made a Dupe, were to him more terrible, than any Misfortune his Imagination could paint. No Man viSited Oliva but himSelf; nor had he ever Seen any the least MiScondudl in her Behaviour. Notwithstanding all his Prudence, he liked her PerSon well enough, to be unwilling to refign her; and, when she was preSent, could not believe any thing against her. The Innocence of her Look, and the unaffeded Simplicity of her Manner engaged hhn to have Such a Confidence in her, that he shewed her
“ the

the Letter. Poor OUva could by no “ means gueSs whence this Malice could . “ ariSe j and, as She was herSelf conScious of no Offence, even in thought, to any “ PerSonin the world,Slie could not imagine “ who could have any Spight against her.
“The next time She Saw her Friend, “ she artlestly told her of it. BerintJola “ made Such an Outcry at the Wkkednefs ‘‘ of the Perfon, who could, without any Provocation, be guilty of Such an Ac-“ tion, as greatly confirmed Olhvd.s Opi-“ nion of her Friend’s fincere and ardent “ Affedion.
“ I Cannot repeat all the treacherous Arts Berinthia made uSe of, to perpetrate her noble Scheme. It is fufficient to inform you, she fo perfedlly Succeeded in it, that she made Lorenzo believe all she defired, and brought him to turn his Thoughts on herSelf for a Wife. She had the Superior Fortune, which Confideration, in the Scale of his Prudence^ had no Smal Weight; but still Olhd.s Perfon dwest strongly on his Imagination, and he could N 3	“ not
198 LETTER XXXV.
not think of quitting her: He there-fore formed another Scheme much more agreeable to his own Defires; and, as he knew OlKoa v/as fond of him, refolved he would make ufe of that FondneSsto ‘‘ betray her. In Short, the poor young Creature, not fufpedling in Lorenzo the least Treachery, fell into the Snare he had baisharoufiy laid to catch her un-“ wary Steps, and became a Prey to his ‘‘ cruel Defigns: and, as I have already told you Lorenzo’s Character, it would be unnecdlary to fay how he behaved afterwards^
BERINTIIIA, who was herSelf in love with Loretizo (for he was very handSom^ and fprightly) now added to her natural Love of Deceit, a Hatred to Oliva^ arifing from JealouSy; and therefore, under a Pretence of Friendihip, went daily to fee her, to fet before her all her Misfortunes in the most glaring Light, and upbraid her with her Crimes. She studied Words that would pierce the Soul the deepest, and strike the moll cutting Daggers to the Heart j and ye “ contrived

contrived it So, that the poor deceived Wretch, whoSe Mind She was torturing, believed She pitied her.
o
“ Thus artfuHy tormented by her Sup-poSed Friend, neglected and Scorned by the cruel LoiAnzo^ and weighed down with the Burthen of her own painful Re-fledlions, poor Oliva (whoSe Mind was unacquainted with Rage) Sunk under her Afflidfions, and pined in Thought’ till Death, her only true Friend, relieved her Sorrows, and the Grave covered her Shame.
“ BERINTHTA now rid of her Rival, Soon married	and, as her
Paffion for him is of that kind that pur-Sues nothing but its own Gratification, and might very eaSily, by a PerSon ignorant of the World, be mistaken for Hatred, it breaks out continually in Jea-loufies, Fewds, Quarrels, and all manner of Confufion : their HouSe is one continued Scene of DiScord and Uproar ; and to them the Names of Wife and Hushand do indeed, as Lothario Says in N 4	“ Lhr

Your Advice, Cynthia, would have been prevalent enough with me, to have made me for the future avoid any Intimacy with Berinthia; but now I know her Story, my own Inclination will alfo lead me to shun and sty her as a Creature too venomous to bo .converfed with.

Cynthia to Camilla at London.
Dear Camilla,	\Erom Bath.
YO U may be certain, I pitied poor Oliva. But, alas! general CompaS-fion cannot at preSent have much place in my Thoughts; Sor my Lyes stream with deeper Sorrow, and my Heart Swells with a more piercing Grief. Oh! Camilla^ I have lost my dear Ophelia who died last Week in the Country of a mercilefs Fever, that Suddenly deprived her of a Life valuable to all who knew her, and more efpe-cially to thoSe, who had a true SenSe of her exalted Merit. Ophelia'^ Countenance was a Picture drawn by Nature, at once to expreSs the highest GoodneSs, and the strongest Understanding. To deScribe her

Features would be impossible; Sor the Lustre that aroSe from her refined SenSe and Good-neSs was So great, that it struck every Beholder with Such Sudden and violent Admiration, that in the general Astonishment, the Power of distinctly examining every Beauty, was lost.
But the Charms of her PerSod^ tho’ She was a conSumate Beauty, were the most trifling of her Perfections; for the GoodneSs of her Heart was So great, that She melted with TenderneSs at others Griefs, whilst she had ReSolution enough to Support any Affliction, in which she alone was concerned. From her Lips could flow no ill-natur’d Expression, as her Heart was incapable of conceiving one malicious Thought. Her Sentiments and Observations were not inferior to thoSe of the greateft and wifest of Mankind, whilst the Simplicity of her Manner brought to the Remembrance of all her Hearers the prattling Innocence of Infancy itSelf.
My Ophelid.s GoodneSs compensated her Beauty, even to her own envious Sex; for,
instead
LETTER XXXVI. 203
instead of making it her PleaSure inSolently to display her own Superiority, a benevolent Delight in Seeing all around her happy, was vifible in her whole Conversation: nor would She ever attempt to purchafe the Reputation of Wit, at the Expence of another’s Uneafinefs.
Goodness itSelf was the Object of her Regard. None were too low to gain her Friendship, whilst they deferved it; nor could even the appearance of her Esteem be bought by outward Circumstances, or exalted Stations,
T o the Sprightly Imagination, whoSe Fire burns brightest in Youth, stie joined the Judgment, that long and dear-bought Experience can give to old Age itSelf. In short, she had the WiSdom of a Philofopher, the Heart of a Christian; or, to Speak more yproperly, she poffeffed the Head and Heart of a Christian Philofopher; whilst her Form gave us a faint Idea of what Angels are.
Volumes could not Speak Ophelia's PraiSes : But, altho’ I know the Impoffi-
bility
204 LETTER XXXVI.
bility of doing Justice to Such a Charaster, yet I find it difficult to quit the Subjed: for the fondest Mother’s Love to her newborn Infant is not too strong a Pidure of my Affediion for Ophelia ; and yet I find Lome Comfort in her LoSs, and think my Tears are more properly Tears of Tender-nefs than of Grief. Forever Since I knew her Worth, I have looked with Trembling and Horror on the Possibility of her being in the power of stupid InfenSibility, or tyrannical Cruelty. I thank God she has eScaped fuch Mifery: and when I confi-der how few Objeds could have given her Pleafure, and what Numbers might have ^given her Pain, I rejoice over her Grave, and triumph in the Thought, that it is now out of the Power of either Ill-Nature or Folly, to torment and rack her honeft, artleSs, tender BoSom.
B u T I dare Say no more, for I every moment expedl your Brother to return home; and, as I know he shares every Pain he but imagines I feel, I would, if possible, prevent his thinking any other Guest but Joy ever inhabits this Breast.
Whi-lst

I Must therefore ceaSe to write of my loved Ophelia^ to stop thofe Tears, which I would conceal from my Valentine. Some Women are perhaps lavish in unfolding their Griefs, lest their Hushands should not have their Right, in sharing whatever they poffefs, yet I must agree with the Author of that inimitable little Piece, call’d,

MADAM,	[From London.
The extreme PleaSure I took in your Company, for the short time I stayed at the Bath, could not be unobserved by you, as I lost no Opportunity of being with you, that was in my power; and, unleSs I was very much mistaken, both as to your Understanding and Goodnature, there is very little Apology necef-fary for my beginning a Correspondence of this kind; for when I tell you, that converfing with you is a real PleaSure to me, I know that I give you the strongest Reafon in the world for indulging me in it ; and that Confideration would have
more
LETTER XXXVII. 207
more Weight with you, than the greatest Assurance that could be given you oS its being likely to prove an Entertainment to yourSelS.
The EaSe and Freedom I found in your Conversation, made me forget we were, what is called newly acquainted; and, from the first day I faw you, I could not help looking on you as my most intimate Friend.
I Scarce ever before met with any one that would understand me; for, if I Said any thing the least out of the common way, I was always told, that it was to shew my Wit; and, tho’ I faid the plainest thing in the World, yet thofe I converted with, were always defiring to know what that might mean.^ and what fine Sentiment was now intended to be deliver’d; So that in the midst of Company I have hitherto teemed to live in a World by my-Self, and to talk a quite different Language from all that I have converfed with. There is nobody who is more fond of communicating their Thoughts without
Constraint;
2o8 letter XXXVII.
Constraint; but yet, till I met with your-Self, there was no c>ne who Seemed more reserved.
IT is with great PlcaSure I have often heard you talk on the various Charaders of Men, and, as I then thought, there were none, but what you Seemed to understand and be acquainted with ; but Since I have been in Town, I have met with three, that I believe have never yet Sain under your Observation.
The Report of the Fortune lately left me by my Aunt, has procured me innu-merahle Lovers, and among the rest, the three Gentlemen I intend to defcribe.
’NI-BL.Newman^ amongst his Acquaintance, is commonly called the Naturaliji. He was bred up under a Man, who was a great natural PhiloSopher ; and, from Some Books that lay continually in the old Man’s Window, he cull’d here and there an Idea concerning what was agreeable to the Nature of Things. The fame Figure as .a Florist would make with the Roots oS two
LETTER XXXVII. 209
or three common Flowers, does our Phi-loSopher make with his Sew Scattered Ideas. But what Sets him off to the best advantage, is my other Lover Mr. Smith., who has no Ideas at all, but what ariSe Srom Experience. He afferted, that there is nothing certain in this World, but what is testified by our SenSes, and whatever he in the Space of thirty Years has never experienced, he pofitively denied, could ever have been fince the Creation.
M R. Serold, my third Lover, tho’ quite different from the other two, is full as odd a Charader as either. He deSpiled Experience, for he Said, that Circumstances too minute for our Observation, might make Things differ very much, when we apprehended them to be alike, and then our Experience would come to nothing j and, as we could not perceive on which of thoSe Circumstances the Event of Things depended, So it was impossible for us to make any Judgment of the future by the past; and, as to the • Nature of Things, there needed no more than the frequent and undecided Disputes upon that head, to prove VoL. II.	O	the
210 LETTER XXXVIi.
the great Uncertainty of that Rule of judging.
V/ H E N E V E R this Gentleman Spoke to me of Love, he diSdained to be too Sub-miffive, and complimented me in the Sol-low^ing manner. “ Oh, Madam, for this Minute you appear (o very beautiful, that “ my Heart feems captivated; but So very uncertain is every thing here, that per-‘‘ haps your Beauty is but Appearance.^ and “ my Heart only feems captivated; for, “ whether there is any thing real under the “ Sun, I know not. I think you have great “ Merit, as well of Mind as of Body; and ‘‘ yet So deceitful are Appearances, that perhapjs your Mind may be filled with ‘‘ every ill Quality, and your PerSon not half fo handfome as it looks to be, thro’ ‘‘ my deceitful Senfes.”
Mr. Serold., when he had thus delivered himSelf, really fancied he had made a Speech that would highly delight me; for he wifely imagined, becaufe a Woman of Senfe does not take pleafure in that nonfenSical Homage, which only p;oves the PerSon 3	who
letter XXXVII. 2II who pays it, to have a Contempt Sor her, that thereSore she must be pleaSed with RudeneSs, and take Ill-breeding for Sincerity.
Mr. Newman uSed to make love to me the following manner. “ It is, Madam, according to the Nature of Lbings, that Men should like Women, and Women Men; it is still correspondent with the Order of the Creation., that Men should like handSome Women best: Certainly Nature gave Beauty to raiSe Admiration, and we follow her great Law, when we admire that Beauty. It is alfo allowed, that, as far as Women furpafs Men in Beauty, fo far do Men excel Women in Understanding; and therefore the latter is properly the Objed: of Admiration to Women. Now, you being a very beautiful Woman, I do, as far as is according to the Nature of Things, admire you ; and, as I may fay without Vanity,

of Marriage, will be just according to the “ Nature of Things V
All this would Mr. Newman Speak in a formal Sedate deliberate Tone, till I could hardly keep my Countenance ; neither was it much eafier to do So, when Mr. Stnith addressed me, which was generally in the following manner. ‘‘ Madam, ‘‘ I fee you are a Woman of SenSe, there-“ fore I am not afraid of that formal Cox-“ comb Mr. Newman^ who talks Non-“ fenfe of the Nature of Things. I know your Understanding will inform you, that there is no farther Knowledge to “ be attained in this World, than what “ Experience gives us. Now, this Sure “ Foundation of all Wifdom^ this fartheji “ Boundary of the human Understanding, “ has always been my utmost Care to study; ‘‘ and I by experience have found out, “ that Women are to be obtain’d by “ Mens Sollicitations; Oh !

“ Sand
LETTER XXXVII. 213
Sand Years oS poring over musty Books, “ whoSe Tenets are all nonSenSe, and “ whoSe Conclufions are all uncertain.”
All the time Mr. Smith Spoke this, he would strut about the Room, as iS he had just gained Some mighty Conquest, and was Sure of carrying his Point.
I Own I uSed to take great delight in Seeing theSe three odd Fellows together; and one day I contrived to invite them all to Dinner, and got two Girls of my Acquaintance, who were Sprightly, and I Sanded very friendly, to Share the Entertainment. When Dinner was taken away, and the Servants retired, then our Conversation began.
Mr. Smith told a long Story of Some matter, which I have now quite forgot, only to prove, that all Knowledge takes its first Rife from Experience; when Mr. Newman took him up with great Warmth, and Said : “ Sir, So far is Knowledge from being derived from Experience, that I may fay, and I think I may affirm, that O 3 y Experience
2 14 LETTER XXXVII.
“ Experience is no Knowledge at all; the “ SenSes may deceive us. Matters of Fad may be falSe.
Mr. Serold impatiently interrupted him thus: “ ’Tis true, Sir, you are a Man of “ SenSe; Uncertainty is the only certain “ thing ; this I can prove from the greateft ‘‘’Writers of PhiloSophy.
Then Mr. Newman cryed out: “ And “ thoSe Philosophers were in the right, as “ far as concerned the SenSes; but when “ they come to confider the Nature of “ SLhings, abstracted Ideas, and logical Con* “ clufions, then indeed there is Some Cer-“ tainty to be come at.”
“ N o, replied Mr. Serold.^—I beg your “ pardon. Sir; theSe logical Conclufions, as ‘ ‘ you pleafe to call them, may be drawn from falSe Principles; and I think there “ is but one thing certain; and that is, that there is nothing certain.”
Mr. Smith would not Suffer him to proceed farther, but rifing out of his Chair,
Said;
LETTER XXXVII. 215
Said : “ How, Sir, are not Matters of Facst, “ which we See before our Eyes, cer-“ tain?”
Mr. Newman joined him in his Rage, and in an angry Tone Said: “ And is not ‘‘ the Study of the Nature of Lhings the “ Sure way of coming at Truth? Do you Say, that I have all my life been in the

Mr. Serold not liking to be thus quef-tioned, replied: Nay, Gentlemen, you “ ought not to take it ill, that I contr^-“ did you, when you both as strongly “ contradid me; but let us in this affair appeal to the Ladies. ”

whilst they pretended to be following me, really Spent their Time, in finding out new ways of confuting one another; for I found the Bufinefs of their Lives was, to Support their Several favourite Tenets; not that they really thought them of any ufe either to themfelves, or the Society they were Members of, but only from the Dread of being convidled of being of that inferior Order of the Creation, which is capable of being in an Error.
Sometimes, when the DifcourSe was on Love, I ufed to be led in to advance my real Sentiments; Such as, that fome Women had been Sincere and constant; that I thought there was no Love, which did not Seek the Good of its Object.—Then Mr. Newman would immediately bring ten thouSand Arguments to prove, that is was not according to the Nature of Lhings for Women to be constant, or for any one to Seek any body’s Good but their own. Mr. Smith faid, that k had never met with a fincere Woman, in all his thirty Tears Experience, and therefore there could be no Such thing : And

Mr. Seroldy aster a great many Deliberations, concluded, that I might or might not be in the right, for there was nothing certain.
I Pa ID very dearly for all thefe Amufe-ments; for both the young Women I mentioned, and whom I defired to share my Pleasures, turned out to be my greatest Enemies; They were angry to See the Addreffes of thefe three Men paid to me, and that they were not liked best by Such amiable Creatures; and told them, that my whole Scheme was to laugh at them. This enraged them all to Such a degree, to find they had been treated with Contempt, that they left me, and fell in love, or followed, or had a mind to shew their SenSe to thefe two Girls, or any other Girls that came in their way. The Lofs of Such Lovers, or Such Friends, you may imagine^ gave me very little Vexation; but, I own, the Confequences have made me very un-eaSy, for I could go no where, but I heard ten thoufand ridiculous Stories of mySelf; as that I displayed my Charms, only to draw in unwary Men, to laugh at them;
that

that I had Such strange high-flown Notions of Love, that no Man was fit for my Lover, but the Hero of a Romance j and many more ingenious things invented, I fuppofe, by my two good Friends before-mentioned.

Such PerSons, as mifinterpreted all you Said, have been Sorced to Seem reServed the greatest part oS your Life.

Your three Lovers are the Charatsters of fome fmall Part oS Mankind. To get to the Bottom of an Argument, and nicely feparate one Idea from another, requires fome Difficulty, and perhaps may exceed the Power of fome part of the human Species; but general Terms, fuch as, that all things are agreeable to the Nature of things;-—that Experience is the best Master ;~that Events in this World are uncertain, requires no more Penetration, than would be fufficient for a School-Boy to learn his Lesson by rote : and therefore no wonder Men who can go no farther, fliould chuSe to gratify their Vanity by fuch Proofs of their Understanding.

I was yesterday in a Room full of Company, where an Acquaintance of ours, namely Florella^ told me She had accidentally met with the Fragment of a Fairy Tale, which, as She knew I loved that kind of writing, She would fend me. You can hardly imagine the Sneers, Witticifms, Jokes, that immediately stew round the Room, on the childish Taste of reading Fairy Tales.
Several Beaus, whofe Perfons happened to be run up to a great Height, whilst their Understanding was in Miniature, ridiculed the little Creatures, and wondered whether they were now grown more invisible than formerly; for they protested, they had never Seen one of the Pigmies in their lives. One Lady Said, she had forbid all her Servants Suffering Such Books to enter her Doors: “ For, continued she, I have

Years old; and I would not for the “ world they Should be even now So “ childish as to read Fairy Tales.”
Another Lady Said, that although she had no Children, yet would she not keep a Servant about her that was Such a Fool} for that she should exped: a Creature, who was filly enough to be diverted with Such Stuff, would not be able to distinguish one Ribband frqm another.
A N old Gentleman, who fat next me, hid, he SuppoSed theSe People had never heard, or elSe had all forgot, that the Machinery of the Odyjfee itSelf, where Some Events which appear Supernatural are performed, was not at all unlike the Intervention of Fairies; and that one of the greatest Genius’s of our own Nation had condeshended to call his principal Work by the Name of The Fairy ^een.

FAIRY TALE.
WHILST the Princeft, attended only by her favourite Dwarf and the faithful Rofetta, was purfuing her Journey to the Cajile of Wijhes., her Mind was So transported with the ProSpedt of her fu-Sure HappineSs, when fhe Should be once admitted into that fair Castle, that she forgot the Diredtion the old Man had given her; and instead of turning short to the Right-hand, just at the end of a long Cedar-Walk, she kept strait forwards, and proceeded So far into that Walk, that, as the Night now advanced, she had no-hopes, should file return back, of reaching the VoL.

In this Resolution Slie had not gone far, before She Saw a Small Light amongst Some Trees at no great distance. She Sent her Dwarf td‘ inquire who lived there, and if they would receive fome benighted Travellers. He Soon returned with a friendly Invitation, which the Princefs readily accepting, she was conducted to the HouSe, where she was received by a plain, but well-dreffed elderly Woman, who with great chearfulnefs affured her of a fincere and hearty Welcome to the fimple homely Entertainment it was in her power to afford. The Princefs returned her all due Thanks, and told her who she was, the Manner of her lofing her Way, and the D^jfign of her intended Journey,

The PrinceSs Smiled at her DiScourSe, as thinking itdmpofiible for her to prove what She had asserted; but told her, (he was very willing and defirous to hear her Story; which She then began in the following manner.
“ My Mother was married very young to a Gentleman her Parents had provided for her, whom fhe neither liked nor dif-liked. His PerSon was tolerably agreeable, his L'’nderstanding not to be complained of, his Humour eaSy, and his Temper quiet and compoSed; So that my Mother had no ReaSon to find fault with his Behaviour. They lived together nine Years without having any Children; but in the tenth Year of their Marriage I was born, to the great Joy of both my Parents. But beSore I was a Month old, my Father died; and as my Mother, tho’ fhe had a great Esteem and Friendship for him, had not that excessive Fondnefs which would have made his LoSs insupportable, she Soon got the better of her Grief. She doated on me to tlie most extravagant degree ; and in nurSing
and
LETTER XXXVIII. 229
and taking care of me, employed all her Thoughts and all her Time. I was Said to be So extremely handfome, that I Soon became the Sight and Wonder of all the Neighbourhood, and never went by any other Name during my Childhood, but that of the Infant Beauty. My Mother would hardly ever let me be out of her Arms, and confined herfelf So much to the nurSing me, that Want of her accustomed ExerciSe and Air made her very fickly: and she was told by a Phyfician, that if She did not alter her manner of living. She could not hold it long. The poor Woman was; dreadfully alarmed at this Sentence; for her Imagination painted Death in all his most horrid Forms, when She confider’d, that she could not die, without being Separated from her dear Infant Beauty; and therefore, purSuant to the Dodlur’s Advice, she every day rode out in'the Fields for two or three Hours.
One Morning, when she was on horsh-back, attended only with one Servant, as she rode by the fide of a Wood, she heard the Sound of Hollowing, and the Opening of P 3	Hounds,
230 LETTER

Hounds, as in a Sull PurSuit; and looking down just before her HorSe’s Feet, she Saw a poor trembling Hare just crept out of the Wood, but quite panting for Breath, and lying prostrate, as just ready to expire. Her piteous Look, which feemed to beg Pfo-tedtion from her cruel Purfuers, moved Iny Mother to compassionate her DistreSs; and ssre ordered her Servant to take her up, and to convey her fafely home.
This poor Creature had fo. much Gra-Etude in her Difposstion, that to her kind Deliverer She prefently grew tame, and would let my Mother take her up and play with her whenever She pleaSed: Nay, fo deep an Impression had my Mother’s Goodnefs made on her, that (though undoubtedly when I pulled her about, as is the Cafe with most Children, it must be very teazing) She would cheerfully Submit to whatever might give me pleaSure, as if She was fenfible it was agreeable to my Mother.
For

For three Months was the poor Hare preserved, and lived in this manner in our Family; and every Morning She uSed to follow my Mother to the Gate, to Sec her get on horSeback; and on that Occafion would SriSk and play before her, as if it were an Acknowledgment, that by that means Slie had beeri once Saved from the Fury of the Dogs.
But one Day, as foon as my Mother was got on the Horfe’s Back, he fuddenlyr started, and ran away with her; at the Same time kicking and stinging in Such a manner, that my Mother was every moment in danger of falling. The poor Hare was So anxious for her Friend.s Safety, that fhe forgot her own ; and, careleSsty running under the Horfe’s Feet, was trampled on, and crushed to death. The Horfe now stopt; and fuddenly, in the stead of the poor little Animal, appeared a beautiful young Woman, dressed and adorned like the favourite Sultana of an Eastern Emperor.

M Y Mother at first was greatly startled; but the handSome Appearance and genteel Behaviour of the Fairy, for Such my Mother was Soon convinced She was, got the better of her Fears; and immediately alighting from her Hor^e, She intreated the Fairj to walk with her back to the HouSe. The Fairy readily conSented, and told my Mother She never Should forget the Kind-neSs She had received; and as her chief Delight was in Ads of Benevolence, she might ever depend on her Friendship. My Mother Said, that she was not conScious of having ever been So happy, as to have it in her power to be of the least Service to any Fairy; but she hoped she had always endeavoured to be as Serviceable as she could to any of her Fellow-Creatures that wanted her Assistance. The Fairy anSwered, that she Would Soon explain herfelf, by telling her the History of her Life; which, as Soon as they were arrived at the HouSe, she began in the following manner.
“My Father and Mother were both “ Fairies; but having many more Children,

“ I was Sent, as Soon as I was fix Years old, “ to live with an Uncle, who was a great “ Magician, and had greater Power than “ most oS the Fairy Race: For tho’we are “ all Superior to you Mortals, yet we differ “ very much in Power one amongst an-“ other. The immenSe Riches of my “ Uncle made my Parents very readily part “ with me to him, as hoping it would be “ highly to my Advantage: And as he had “ always appeared to them as a very good-“ natur’d Fairy, only with Some few Par-“ ticularities in his Temper, they made no “ doubt of my being well ufed. The “ truth was, that he was really very good “ to all thoSe who were not in his Power, “ but a perfedl Tyrant to thoSe that were : “ And what was extremely odd was this, “ that though he took the greatest delight “ in the world in teazing and tormenting, “ yet he had made himSelf believe, that “ it was only for the Good of the poor “ Creature thus tormented, and not from “ the great Joy he took in exercifing his “ Power over them.

The Fairy shook her Head, and faid she could not go from her Word:	But, continued she, I wish
“ you would retradt the Request you have “ made; for So blind are Mankind to their “ own real HappineSs, that it is oftner to “ the Gratification than the DiSappoint-“ ment of their Wishes that all their Mi-“ Sery is owing : And this which you have “ requested as a Bleffing, may prove your Daughter’s greatest CurSe.”
The good Fairy and my fond Mother had a long Argument on this Subjedl, in
which
238 LETTER XXXVIIL
which the former fairly proved, that it would be better for me not to be indulged in every Wish : But still the Imagination of the latter had raiSed fuch Pitstures of Pleafure to herfelf, in feeing her dear In-fant Beauty gratified in all her Wishes, that she would not hearken to any ReaSonj but concluded every Sentence with a Petition to have her Request granted. As no Arguments could prevail with my Mother to change her Request, the good-natur’d Fairy confented; and looking on me with TenderneSs and Compashon, she with re-ludlance and a deep Sigh addressed me in theSe Words: ‘‘You have, fair Infant, Said “ she, an extreme good natural DiSpoSition, “ and shall, as you grow up, have leSsLe-“ vity than is common to your Sex, which “ will guard you from very great Evils j “ but I fear a Life of UnhappineSs is but “ too certainly your Lot, fince I am in a “ manner compelled to pronounce this “ Sentence, that you shall never fail of “ having the Completion of every Wilh “ that comes within a natural Possibility, “ and implies no abSolute Contradistion: And this Power shall continue as long as

“ your Mother lives, and you are ignorant “ oS that Powcrf’
Th u s, in my InSancy, when I had fcarce SenSation enough to wish one thing more than another, did I enjoy the SuppoSed Blessing (tho’ unknown to mySelf) of having every Wish compleated. Whilst I was young enough to wish for Play-things, thoSe very Play-things, in Some shape or other, did me Some MiSchief. I wished for Knives, which cut my Fingers; for Dolls So big, that I could not manage them, but uSed to beat my Face with them, or fall down and beat mySelf against them. I wished for little Cats and Dogs, which fcratch’d and bit me So, that I was generally all over Scratches, and bruiSed black and blue; and, from Some accident or other, that attended the Fruition of almost all my Wishes, I was continually in Tears, and my Mother’s FondneSs for me was her greatest Torment.
I grew by this means fo humourfome and troubleSome, that every body hated the fight of me : This was an additional Plague to the poor Woman ; for, as she hated every
body
240 LETTER XXXVIII.
body who did not love me, she was in a constant Rage and Perturbation oS Mind, at Seeing me distiked and shunned.
W H E N I grew a little older, I one day happened to be in Company with three or four Mistes that were at a Boarding-School, who talked So much of their Companions, that I thought it would be a charming thing to live with fo many Girls of my own Age and Size. No Sooner had I formed in my Mind a Defire to go to School, but my Mother, who had hitherto kept me as much as postible in her light, reSolved to fend me thither.
I W A s, on first coming there, very much diSpleafed, for I was an utter Stranger to most of the Girls, ajid they all Seem’d referved and cold to me: I was likewife under Command, a thing I had never been uSed to at home, and it feemed very hard to me to meet with the least Contradistion. However I had no mind to quit the School, but wished that I might be Such a Favourite with my MistreSs, that fhe should have the greatest Partiality imaginable
LETTER XXXVIII. 241
able for me. This immediately happened, and then I was more miSerable than ever; for from that moment all the whole School took Such an Averfion to me, that amongst the whole Number, I could not meet with one that would keep me company. If the MistreSs heard of their Faults, they always fancied I told her ; this I never did, but, as they believed it, they behaved just in the fame manner, as if their Con-jestures had been true : Make~mijchief\ Idl-Lale, Blabb^ all the Terms of Reproach they could think on, were thought good enough for her, who was So happy, as to have her MistreSs particular to her.
I Wa s quite tired of this Life ; and my next Wish w'as, to have one of the Misses, whom I took a great Fancy to, particularly fond of m.e: This preSently (in appearance) happened; but, as she had no real Fondnefs in her Nature, was a very artful Girl, and had a great deal of Envy^ (he was the greatest Plague I had ever met with: she contrived to get me out of my MistreSs’s Favour, and at the fame time pde the Girls believe, I continued in it. Vpl. II.	Whatever
242 LETTER XXXVIII.
Whatever appearance there was oS her Falshood, fhe made her Companions impute it to my Art; for fhe always Said behind my back, that I was the most cun-nmg Creature alive, tho’ in reality I was quite the contrary: however, this Outcry of my AjA had the defired Effed, and made me more the ObjeO: of Hatred than ever. This my fancied Friend was at laft discovered by me, fori accidentally overheard her giving an account to one of the Girls, of all the Tricks fhe had played, and what a Dupe fhe had made of me.
Thus I found myfelf ufed ill on all hands; for my MistreSs, who was at firft partial to me without a Reafon, now hated me without a CauSe. My School-Fellows abhorred me, and my Favourite had deceived me; So that, quite weary of School, I reSolved, the next time my Mother c^me, to go home with her. This happened very Soon, for fire came often to See me, and hitherto had always gone away in Tears, becauSe fhe Saw me So; but Ihe was rejoiced to find I defired to go home,
and
LETTER XXXVIII. 243
and immediately complied with my Re^ quest.
When 1 had left School, I began to throw off the Child, and commence Wo-» man; and then my first Wish was, to bd the general Objedl of Admiration of alli both Men and Women, who faw me j but, as this was impoffible, and a contra*-distion, there hKi^%fomefew Women, who, cannot admire nor love the Objed; of Mens Admiration, the Fairy could do no more, than grant what, by her Penetration into the Mind, she knew, would pleafd me best.
Now I never faw a Man, who did not immediately become my Admirer, I did not Say my Lover: for, as I liked nobody, and my only Defire was Admira-^ tion, the Distance I kept, and the Re-ServedneSs of my Behaviour fuffered no Man to think I was attainable, and therefore I received no Serious PropoSals; but was adored rather like an Idol than addrelfed as a Woman. The Women, who could beaf to See another more admired than themSelVes, 0^2	were
244 letter xxxvm.
were really very fidendly to me (for I never hiSulted them, nor gave mySelS any Airs on the Merit of Superior Beauty) and adedac-c irding to their own good Inclinations, in doing me every Piece of Service in their power; nay, they liked me the better for being handfome, as it was one Qualification, that rendered me more amiable.
One might reaSonably imagine, that this Situation would make any PerSon happy, and yet I was very miferable; for the incredible Devices of the Envious, in raiSing Lyes, and propagating them against me, and the many falfe Friends I had, who took care, that not one Lye that was I'pread, should die without my knowing it, plagued me fo much, that I had no
Peace : fo that, I was worried undeferved-
. f
ly by my Enemies, tormented by my Friends, and gained by it only a little. Flattery, whkh cost nothing to thole who bestow’d it on me, as they pleafed themfelves with being in the Fashion, (for it was then the Fashion to flatter me) and which gave me no real PleaSure. What Surprized me much was, that I often found, on tracing them out, the mostvirulent
Lies
LETT E R XXXVIII. 245
Lies invented against me had taken their first RiSeSrom Women, whoSe Beauty gave them So little Pretence to be liked themSelves, that, if I had never been born, they vaould have had no Chance of procuring even one Admirer, tho’ they Sliould have thrown themfelves in the way of Men who had been half a Year at Sea, without feeing the Face of a Woman.
This I thought must ariSe from the utmost Malignity; for, if a Man, whoSe HoiiSe was in every refpedl Suited to his Taste, and form’d for his Pleafure, except the Want of a Profped;, and the Want of that Profpedl was caufed by a few tall Trees of his Neighbour’s, that stood in his way; if that Man, I Say, was to fell thofe Trees to the Ground, tho’ he had no right to do it, there might be Some Alleviation found for the Guilt of Such an Adlion: But should any one run about, cutting down his Neighbour’s Trees, where it could be of no Advantage to himfelf, nor any Pleafure, but merely from the Love of doing fpiteful and ill-natured Actions, Such 0^3	Malignity
246 LETTER XXXVIII.
Malignity wopld deferve no Forgive-peSs.
I LIV E p on about three Years after I left School, which was till I was Seventeen Years old, pretty much in the Same manner ; for, being naturally of a quiet indolent Temper, I had very few Wishes, that went farther than the prefent Minute; Such as going to Balls, Seeing any fine Place or Show I had heard of, and many other things as trifling, and too numerous to repeat. But tbefe, like my Childish Wistes for Play-things, all brought their Incon-veniencies; for I never appeared in any public Places, but, by the Envy of others,
I was plagued, as I have before men-tipned.
You will wonder perhaps to hear, that jn Seventeen Years, I Should Seem to have had So few Wishes, and they should have produced So Sinall a Number of Incidents; but this was owing to the extreme Good-neSs of my Temper, and natural DiSpoSi-tion; for, as I had not one Spark of Re-yenge pr Malice in my Compofition, I never
letter xxxvm. 247
ver wished any harm, even sto thofe, who fiad done me an Injury ; and I Scarcely^ thought it poshble in Nature for a Perfon to hurt, or wish to hurt thofe who. had never offended them; So that my own UnhappineSs alone, was all that was. procured by the Fairy's Gift.

M Y Mother Seeing me for ever wretch- . ed and uneaSy, began now to be convinced of what the Fairy had told her; and fearing, as I grew older, and my Passions ftronger, that I might make Some hasty Wish, which might prove my utter Ruin, ste most earnestly wished to have the Gift retraced.

‘ My Mother did not at first understand her; blit at last remembring, that it was granted to me to continue, only during her Life, or during my Ignorance of it, ssie immediately reSolved to let me into the Secret, and to deprive me of So fatal a Power. But the Fatry stopt her, and told her, that she did not perhaps know, that, by thofe very Conditions, the LoSs of her own Life would be the Confequence of Such a Discovery. But this did not in the least prevent her first Intentions; for she an-Swered, that she never wished to preServe her Life but for my Sake, and stiould now most willingly part with it for my Advantage. She came diredbly into my Chamber, fat down on the Bed, and bursting into Tears, told me, that she had been the Caufe of all the Unhappinefs that I had Suffered; and then recounted to me every Circumstance between her and the Fairy, as I have before related ; and, before I could make her any AnSwer, she fell on my Neck, and tenderly embracing me, breathed her last. I imagined it only a fainting Fit, and exerted mySelf to call
for
letter XXXVIII. 249
for Help, and uSed my utmost Endeavours to restore her back to Life, but all in vain; and I Soon found the Power I So lately had been made acquainted with was lost; for all my Willies for her Recovery were inef-fedual. The Lofs of fo good a Mother, though she was really the Caule of my Un-happinefs, gave me inexpreshble Concern.
Whilst I was one day fitting alone, and indulging my Grief, the Fairy appeared before me, confirmed all that my Mother had faid, and fo strongly af-fured me of the Impoffibility there was of my Mother’s ever enjoying a happy Hour in this World, that I became in a manner reconciled to her Fate: and when I re-fleded, that she lost her Life willingly, to make mine eafy, it appeared to me a piece of Ingratitude to frustrate her good De-Sign, by indulging a fruitleSs Sorrow. The Fairy professed great Friendship and Love to me; and faid, that for my Mother’s fake file was determined never to abandon me. She again recounted over the various Accidents of my Life, and feemed plainly to prove, that all my Misfortunes aroSe from
th^
250 LETTER XXXVIII.
the Gratifications oS my Wishes: And, Said she, “ I make no doubt but you would “ now refuSe the Continuance oS that
Power, if it was offered you.” .
I Considered Some time on what she had Said; and then anSwered, that I apprehended that rr^y UnhappineSs was rather owing to my Ignorance of that Power, and the early Part of my Life on which it was bestowed; but was I now to command the Accomplishment of my Wishes, I did not doubt, but from the Experience I had already had, and the Diredfion of my own ReaSon and Judgment, that I could make myfelf very happy.
The good Fairy was greatly concerned to find my Inclinations turn that way, and knew how impoffible it was to convince me, but by Experience, of the Error I was in. But as she fincerely loved me, she was reSolved Some way or other that I should be happy. She Saw my Mind So bent on a further Trial, that unleSs I was indulged in it, nothing could make me eafy; and yet she greatly dreaded the ConSequence of
Such
letter XXXVIII. 251
Sjch an Indulgence. However, she at last determined to grant what I defired for one Year longer; and then she made no doubt but I should be thoroughly tired of wishing, and might live contented with a ycommon Lot. She gave me many kind Instructions, and begged me most earnestly to confider well, before I formed any Wish j and, to prevent the ill Confequences that might follow thoSe made rashly and inconsiderately, she fo far limited the Power, that no Wish could take effeCt, unlefs it was thrice repeated, and the Distance of an Hour kept between every Repetition. She then told me, that as I had chofen to have the Direction of my own Fate, she could not any ways affist me; but when the Time was expired, she would vifit me again, and do me all the kindnefs that lay in her power. And faying this, she dif-appeared.
I Cannot fay that I felt any Sorrow at her Departure; for I was So elated with the Thoughts of my approaching Happi-neSs, that I feemed already in poffeshon of every Bleffing this World could bestow ;
and
252 LETTER XXXVIII.
and by the Fairy's last Precaution, I San-cied mySelf guarded against all Sorts of Evils; and made no doubt but that at the end oS the Year the Fairy., Seeing me So excessively happy, w6uld continue this valuable Gift to the End of my Life.
When the Fairy left me, I had really no fettled WiSh or Defire formed in my Mind, unlefs thofe fluctuating Emotions which, like the Bubbles on the Water, are born and die in the fame instant, can be called fuch ; but on the contrary, instead of being hurried on by the Impetuofity of any particular Defire, I only fat down feriousty to confider what I Should do to convince the Fairy, that her granting my Request would prove my Happinefs.
M Y first Wish was for a very large Increase of Fortune; for though I had already a Competency, yet as I Saw all Mankind making Riches their chief Purfuit, I imagined there must be Something very valuable in what the whole World Seemed So highly to esteem. But, as I had really no natural Taste for Grandeur, this Wish
did
LETTER XXXVIII. 253
did not come Srom my Heart; and therefore, in much leSs than the three Hours allowed by the Fairy, I was convinced by my ReaSon of the Vanity of it, and the Impoffibility of its adding one Grain to my HappineSs: And indeed I Saw plainly, that it would rather Subjedl me, in many CaSe% to DiSquiet; and, without farther Hefi-tation, I immediately threw it by, and did not a little exult in the Conquest I had gained. I now Seemed more perfetstly Satisfied than ever, that my own Prudence and Consideration would intirely prevent all thofe ill ConSequences the Fairy had ever apprehended from her Gift.
My next WiSh was to have more Understanding than any Woman in the World; and I made not the least doubt, but that the Wisdom of Such a Defire would Secure me from its being attended with any Inconvenience. Here I was ignorant that true Understanding is not in the Gift of Fairies, who can only give the Appearance and Af-fedation of it. TheSe became prefently my Lot, (for my Wish was always to be com-pleated as far as in the Fairfs Power.) I
now
254 LETTER XXXVIII,
now began to imagine that my Understanding was Superior to that of other Women ; and with this Imagination I was greatly pleaSed. My Beauty attracted the Eyes of all who Saw me; and whenever I Spoke, there was a Deference paid to my Words which almost convinced me of my great, and Superior Senfe to that of any of the Company. But yet I was but almofl convinced, for I had Some Sufpicions that this was a Compliment paid me on the account of my Beauty. The Anxiety I Suffered lest it Should be So, and the vast Care I was continually in to maintain my affumed Character of Wifdom, more than over-balanced the PleaSure I received from my own fancied Superiority.
After I have been in Company, I have kin awake whole Nights, recollecting each Word that has been uttered; and if once I could interpret any thing that \)^as Said to convey the least Hint that I did not Sit firm on my SThrone of Wifdom, my Eyes have streamed with Tears, and my Heart has beat with Such convulfive Pangs as if Some Sad. Misfortune had befallen me. One of mf
greatest
LETTER XXXVIII. 255
greatest Griefs was, that most of the Men I conversed with would make love to me. This I looked upon as a strong Indication that my PerSon and not my Understanding was the Objedl of their Admiration. My Mind was in a manner jealous of my Body, and Suffered the utmost UneafineSs at every AddreSs or ReSpedt that was paid to its envied Rival: And, as Envy is the greatest MiSery the Mind can endure, I led a most wretched Life.
A T last I took it into my Confidcration how to get rid of this odd Perturbation and Hurricane which poffested my Mind; and reSolved that I would find Some Method of being convinced that my PerSon had, no share in the Compliments I received. I have Since refledted that I might indeed have wished for the Small Pox, or Some Accident by which I Should have lost my Beauty; but at that time I never once thought of this Expedient, chufing rather to wifli that I might be intimate with three or four Men of Senfe, who would deign to converSe with me, and never once mention the Word Love. When the WiSh
I
V
256 LETTER xxxvm.
I had formed was really the Bent of Inclination, the three Hours which the good Fairy had given me for Confideration, )be-fore my Wish could be confirmed, were only employed in painting to mySelf the Hap-pinefs that would attend the Fruition of it; So that when the time allotted was expired, my Wish was commonly ten times more ardent than at first.
I Was So pleaSed to think that I should get So many Instructions from Men who would talk to me as they do to one another, that I imagined I should now build on my own natural Understanding a Fund of Knowledge, which would make my Mind as maSculine as my PerSon was effeminate. According to my DeSire, I Soon became acquainted with three or four Men of Learning and Understanding, who either had not, or had made them-felves imagine that they had not, any Taste for Beauty. I was reSolved to behave mySelf in fuch a manner, as not to be taken for a filly Woman ; and therefore gave up all Ceremony, and expeCted no more Regard than they paid to each other. Decency
they
LETTER XXXVIIL 257
they had SenSe enough to preScribe to them-Selves; and that was all I required.
They were at first much pleaSed to meet with a Woman who expedted no Adoration; and I was equally pleaSed to meet with Men who would pay me none. They addressed great part oS their DiScourSe to me; and I was happy to think my Understanding was preferred to my Beauty. This lasted for a Fortnight, during which time I exulted fo much in the Succefs of my Scheme, that Joy now banished Sleep from my Eyes as much as Sorrow had done before. I lay all night ressedling on what I had faid the preceding Day; which I always approved, and imagined all the Company ioined with me in my Opinion; which Imagination gave me a Pleafure too great to be described.
A T last theSe my Male - Companions (when the Novelty of converfing with a Woman in this manner was over) began to treat me wish the utmost Neglect; and as I did not expedt any peculiar Deference to be paid to me, they in the Lofs of Cere-VoL. II.	R	mony
258 LETTER XXXVm.
mony Stvallowed up all Civility, and in a manner Shut me out of the Company. They would neither hearken to nor anSwer me, but talked to each other, and gave me very little opportunity of fpeaking ; and whenever they allowed me^that Honour, they were Sure to contradid: me, even before they knew or understood what I was about to fay: And, as in order to prove my SenSe, I had thought proper to give up the Behaviour due to me as a Woman, they now treated me rather like a Child; and, as they Saw me willing to be instruded, the only Notice they now ever took of me was, that each would govern me in his Turn. One would have me think one way, another would infpire me with Sentiments the very contrary to thofe of his Companion. A third would not have me talk any Sentiments at all, and a fourth infisted on my learning things above my Comprehensson. It was impossible to pleafe them all; and yet, as I was afraid any one of them should think meanly of my Understanding, I was mad enough to attempt it; by which means I disobliged them every one; and we grew reciprocally tired of each other. They
were

259
were weary of endeavouring to govern and teach me, becauSe I did not oppoSe them enough to gratify their Pride with having gained any Conquest: and when I found shat they only delighted to prove their own SenSe, without taking any pains to bring mine to my Remembrance, I grew weary of being tutored; and in short at last found out that I was playing the Part of little Children, who when they would grafp any thing beyond their Reach, only pull it on their own Heads, and do themfelves a miSchief.
Now I fell into the other Extreme; and as this Fancy about Understanding had plagued and teazed me to fuch a degree, I began to have an utter Contempt for all Understanding ; and, as I had before looked on it as the only thing valuable, I now de-fpiSed it So much, that I chofe to converfe with Silly People rather than any others; and I ran about to all publick Places, and endeavoured to amufe myfelf the best I could, with whatever Accident threw m my way.
R a
2 6o letter XXXvm.
I, Wh o had So lately been the Woman of SenSe, (that is, in my own Fancy) was now become So full of Levity, that I hardly knew how to find .any thing trifling enough to amuSe me. I was cpntinually Surrounded with that Part of the human Species who are eternally buSy, though they have nothing to do ; and eternally talking, though they have nothing to fay: and whilst I lived in this manner, I never gave myfelf time to rested; or wifh for any thing. But as the Appearance I was obliged to make, in order to keep Such Company, carried me into the Expences of DreSs, Equipage, and Entertainments, I found my Fortune decreafing very fast, and I was obliged to pauSe, in order to confider how I flioiild next proceed. Though I had not in this manner of paffing my Time found any great Pleafure, yet neither had I Suffered any violent UneafineSs. A Continuance of it was quite im possible, without an Increafe of Fortune ; and therefore I Set mySelS Se-rioufly to confider, whether it would be worth my while to wifh for a Fortune to ccntinue it. But as Levity had no share
in
LETTER XXXVIII. 261
in my natural DiSpofition, and was only taken up in a Rage, in oppofition to what I had been So teazed with before, I Soon gave up the Point, and thought, by greatly retrenching my Expences, I Should per-j ceive whether any of my late Companions were worth my further Acquaintance: But I Soon found mySelf intirely deSerted ; which (as I very much expedled it) gave me no fort of Uneafinefs.
However, my next WiSh was to meet with a fincere Friend. Had a Month, in stead of three Hours, been allowed me for Consideration, I Should still have concluded, that this WiSh was the wiSest I could form ; and from the Moment it was first projedted, it was Sure of being confirm’d. Well, I met with this fincere Friend, in a young Lady whofe Heart was as Sincere and as open as I could defire ; and we were for Some time as happy as I could wish; and in the Freedom of our Conversation, having now a Companion to whom I could without ReServe open all my Thoughts, I Seemed perfectly happy. But this did not laft long j for my Mind R 3	was
262 LETTER XXXVIII.
was not fully Satisfied for want of an Employment which Should intirely poffeSs it; and at last I took it into my head to wish to be in love.
The three Hours given me for Con-fideration now flew So fast, that they Seemed to my Imagination no more, than three Minutes; for Such Scenes of PleaSure presented themSelves before me in the Con-fideration that I Should have an agreeable Objedl on which to employ all my Thoughts, that I was for the prefent un-fpeakably happy; and I fancied that now even my Friend would become a double Blessing to me, as the different Sen-fations my Lover’s Behaviour would give me, must be an eternal Subject of Conversation to entertain her with ; whereas before I had really nothing to fay to her, but what I might have trusted to an Enemy.
As foon as I had confirmed this Wish of being in love, I had the Passion even before I met with an Objedt. No wonder therefore I fixed on the first that preSented itSelf to my View, In short. Accident
threw
LETTER XXXVm. 263
threw Bernardo in my way; and with Bernardo I was immediately enamoured to Such a degree, that had I endeavoured to conceal it, to a judicious Eye that Endeavour must have been fruitleSs; as the Mind struggling with a new-born Passion has always too much Employment to admit a Possibility of concealing it.
Interest and PleaSure So alternately Swayed Bernardo'^ Mind, that the most distinguishing Judgment could not pronounce which did most preponderate. He would oSten Sacrifice his Interest to the PleaSure of purSuing a Woman; and yet, when he thought himfelf fare of Succefs, he would relinquish that very Woman for any the most trifling Point of Interest. Ke had Understanding enough to be very agreeable (at least I thought fo) but, not fatisfied with what he possessed, he was alwayo straining to fee fo far beyond the Mark, that he overlooked every thing in his Viev/.
I Never put on the leastDifguiSe, and yet he was always ignorant of my true R 4.	.Character;;
264. LETTER XXXVIII.
Charadter • for he Sanded the World to be one great MaSquerade, in which every one performs a Part in a Malk; and therefore would not believe, there was any Such thing in the whole Scene, as a bare Face: nay. So far did he carry this Notion, that, whenever fuch a Prodigy appeared, he only took it for a more artful MalkC
This Charadter of my Lover, is Sufficient to explain what a Life I led, from the time my Heart was attached to him. He at once fufpedlsd my Sincerity, and yet made uSe of that very Sincerity to torment me : He had not one Grain of Ten-dernefs in his Difpofition, and therefore could work up my Paffions to MadneSs, and at the fame time think the Follies I was guilty of in the Vent of thofe Paffions, a fit Subjedt of Ridicule and Laughter.
S E L INDA, who was fincerely my Friend, became my Curfe; for, as I could not conquer my Pafiion, I wanted her to flatter me in it, rather than Speak that Truth, which, when She Saw me in Agonies at Bernardd.s Ill-ufage, Sire could not help
letter XXXVIII. 265
uttering. Every time She endeavoured to perSuade me, that breaking with Bernardo, was the only means to procure my own HappineSs; She increaSed my Distike of her: till I came to have Such an Averfion to her, that I dreaded her Sight more, than I should have done that the most fright-Sul horrid Monster the World ever produced. Nay, So strong an Impression had Bernardss Sanded Charms made on my Imagination, that, when my Friend endeavoured to combat with my Passion, for my own Good, I was jealous, that she meant Some Treachery towards me, and wanted to get my ffover herSelf.
W H E N I first Saw Bernardo, I thought that I would on no account marry him, unleSs his Love was reciprocal, and he behaved in a manner to deServe my Esteem ; blit I did not confider, that my FondneSs for him, would render it impoffible for him, even with his utmost Endeavours, to forfeit my Esteem; and that, whenever it was in my power to gratify my Love, I should find it very difficult, to fancy his was not reciprocal.
At
266 LETTER XXXVIII.
A T last I wished to be married to him j and I now thought, that his preSent USage of me, was only to try my Love, or that perhaps it might be owing to a little Co-quettry in his Nature, which Matrimony would cure ; ^i^at he might have a few capricious Humours, which, by studying and indulging, I might turn to my advantage. I remembred to have heard it remarked, that the most obSequious Lovers often make the most tyrannical Hushands; in short, I mustered up So many Reflexions to prove, that there was nothing in Bernardo‘s Temper that would make me unhappy, when he was my Huf-band, that I did not at all hefitate in confirming my Wish.
I Soon found by his Behaviour, that this was not to be brought about but by an EncreaSe of my Fortune, for he would not marry me, whilst it was any Disadvantage to him ; but even this I imputed to a prudent Consideration for our future HappineSs. However, it Sometimes came into my head, that it might be Some fmall
Want
LETTER XXXVIII. 267
Want of Affedtion, and thereSore I reSolv-ed to take a Month, instead oS three Hours, beSore I absolutely confirmed the WiSh of Fortune, which was to compleat my former one.
JB u T in the mean time all Objedfions were removed by the Death of Selinda^ who really loved me So well, notwithstanding my late Treatment of her, that she left me all she was worth ; which was So considerable an Addition to my Fortune, that Bernardo deigned to accept it, without any farther Hefitation; and So much had I forgot all my Suspicions, that within a Week we were married.
T o deScribe, or give another an adequate Idea of the State of my Mind from this time forward, is imposhble. The foaming Ocean and the raging Waves, the contending Elements before the bursting of a dreadful Storm, are but faint Images of the tumultuous Paffions, which alternately war-^ red within my wretched Bofom. I loved and hated, admired and defpifed in fuch short Spaces of Time, that the feveral Emotions
of
268 L E T T E R XXXVIII.
of my Mind could Scarcely be distinguish’d from each other. My Wish, that my Huf-band would behave differently, was fruit-lefs; for it was not in the Fairy's power to alter a Man’s Nature; and Affedtion or Love had So Small a share in his DiSpo* fition, that he understood thoSe Words no more, when I mentioned them, than lie would, if they had been expressed in a Language, of which he could not even read the Charadters.
W H E N I had lived this miSerable Life three Months, my Year of wishing was out, and the Fairy according to her Pro-mife, appeared to me : The first Question she ashed, was, whether I had not found her Words true, and would not now be glad, for the rest of my Life, to take the common Fate of Mortals, and not defire a Renewal of her former Gift: I replied, that I would willingly put my Fate into her hands, if she would contrive any Method of relieving me from the Pertur-* bation of Mind I then daily endured; for that Negledt and inSolent Scorn from the
letter XXXVIII. 269
Man I loved, had almost turn’d my Brain, and drove me to MadneSs.
The Fairy then plainly proved to me, that every UneafineSs I had hitherto SuS-Sered, was intirely owing to the having my Wishes compleated; and concluded with telling me, that, had I not infisted on that Satal Gift, I should never have been married to Bernardo; for, instead of Selinda^ I should have met with fome falSe Friend, who would have got him from me, for which I should indeed have been at first much grieved, but afrerwards my Fate would have married me to a Man of great Good-nature and true Understanding, who would have really loved me, and with whom I should have been very happy.
But, continued the good Fairy^ I will “ not forfake you, but will exert the ut-most of my Power to comfort and re-lieve you.”
After uttering thofe Words, she left me, and I heard nothing of her for half a Year, during which time I led the fame unhappy Life as before her last Appear-
270 LETTER XXXVIII.
ance; Sor the Same Love on my fide, and the Same Contempt on my Hushand’s still continued, till he was Seized with a raging Fever, which, notwithstanding all proper Applications, and my most astiduous Care, in three days deprived him of Life, and threw me into Such Agonies, that I have often wondered how it was possible to Survive them. I raved, wept, stamp’d, beat my Breast and tore my Hair; in short, every Vent the most passionate Grief ever found, I then experienced, and yet all was too little, to eaSe the Load my fond Heart was burthened with.
Perhaps it may appear incredible, after what I have related of Bernardo^ Ufage of me, that his Death should affest me in this manner, and yet it was Solemnly true; for it was at least a Fortnight, before I once recollected any Part of his Behaviour that had made me unhappy, and every kind Word or Look he had ever given me from my first Acquaintance with him, haunted me like Ghosts, and were for ever preSent to my Fancy.
I
LETTER XXXVIII. 271
IAccused the Fairy of UnkindneSs and Breach of PromiSe, that she should now, in the time of my greatest Neceffity, forSake me ; but, as foon as my Grief began to fubfide, and I was capable of hearkening to ReaSon, she again appeared, and told me, that she had left me to mySelf in the height of my Agonies on purpofe, that their Violence might exhaust themSelves; for she knew, that contending with PaS-Sions, when they poffefs the whole Mind, is the way to continue them. She begged me to confider, that I had lost only my Torment, and my Mind would now be free from Perturbation, and recover the Tranquillity it was naturally inclined to. I Soon experienced the Truth of her Words, for I daily grew more eaSy, till at last I was convinced, that nothing could have been fo conducive to my Happioefs, as the LoSs of my Hushand.
From the time I once gave mySelf Leave to think, that I could live, and bear the being deprived of BernartIo, I grew every Day, nay, every Hour, more eaSy
and
272 LETTER XXXVIII.
and compoSed in my Thoughts: Every AmuSement I could meet, without paying too dear for it, I enjoyed : and, as I had no eager Withes, I had no Disappointments.
The good Fairy came often to viSit me, and confirmed me in my ReSolution, never again to be So unreasonable, as to defire to have all my Wishes compleated; for she convinced me, that the short-Sighted Eyes of Mortals were not formed to See, whether the Event of any of their own Willies would produce most HappineSs or Mifery: and that our greatest Felicity often ariSes from the very Difappointment of thofe Defires, the Gratification of which at the first View, feems to be necessary to our Welfare.
About a Year after I was a Widow, I became acquainted with my preSent HuS-band, whom the Fairy has fince inform’d me, I should have been first married to, had not that fatal Gift joined me to Bernardo. I shall not trouble you with any Particulars of our Courtship, but only in-3	form
LETTER XXXVIII.
273
form you, that in about three Months we were married.
My Hushand has Something very uncommon in his Character; for he never judges of any Point, till he has thoroughly examined it; and when his own Inclinations are concerned, he always deliberates with a much stricter Exadnefs, before he makes any Determination. In Short, he is perfedfly reafonable, and examines him Self, and the Motions of his own Mind So nicely, that I never had any the least Caufe to complain of him, fince I have been his Wife. At first, indeed, I fometimes wanted Indulgences not altogether conformable to Reafon ; but then, instead of denying me any Request with the Tyranny of an arbitrary Master, he in the kindest gentlest manner ufed to take Such pains to make me distinguish Right from Wrong, that I was both Satisfied of his Good-nature, and convinced of his Superior Judgment; and Soon came to have Such a Confidence in him, as to be certain, that, whilst I obeyed him, I could not err.

Mifs. Do, Papa, do; buy it this moment.
Old Gent. Agreed, provided you’ll pro-miSe me not to make it up this Twelve-month.

Old Gent. Then I imagine, the Colours will Sade.
Prim. Not the least. Sir, I assure you.
Old Gent. Then pray, my Dear, how is it possible for the fame individual Lhing^ without the least Alteration, to be charming now., and frightful a Tear hence ^
Mifs, La ! Papa ! why, you are So comical—you know ’twill be out of PaJhioHy and then ’twill be hideous for any Creature to be Seen in it.
Old Gent. You Say then, that a Year hence ’twill be out of Fashion, and hideous.
Both. Indeed, Sir, it will.
Old Gent, But now ’tis fashionable and charming.
Both.
LETTER XXXIX. 289
Both. It is, Sir, indeed.
Old Gent. And pray, Mr. Prints how long has it been in Fashion ?
Prim. Not a day, Sir, upon my Honour. ’Twas imported but this very Morning Srom France.
Old Gent. A Year ago, then, there were other Silks in Fashion.
Prim. There were.
Old Gent. And now they are out.
Prim. They are.
Old Gent. And consequently hideous.
Mifs. To be Sure, Papa.
Old Gent. And So it happened for Years past, and will happen for Years to come.
Prim. Your Honour is certainly in the Right.
Old Gent. It should Seem then, Mr. Pn’z«, that this Same Thing, call’d Fajhion, was fomething prone to perpetual Muta~ tion.

LETTER XXXIX. 291
Prim, I am very much obliged. Sir, for your good Opinion ; I was all my life long an Enemy to Fallhood.
Old Gent. I dare believe you were; and yet, I warrant, you have been a Sufferer yourSelf. Had you never a Piece of Silk taken up, and never paid for, by a Mock-Lord or a Mock-Lady ?
Prim, Ay, Sir, and by real ones too.
Old Gent, And what fay you to this ? was it right, or was it wrong ?
Prim, I have always esteemed it one of the crying Sins of the Nation.

Prim, Nay, now I am Sure your Honour jokes; for that’s impossible.
Old Gent, V/hat, to make Wrong Right, or Right Wrong ?
Prim, Upon my Credit, Sir, I think So Serioussy.

Old Gent. ’Tis enough. Sir, your Arguments have convinced me. You are, I find, by the whole Tenor of your Conversation, a Friend to that antient School, who maintain the iinalfefable Natures of Truth and Ealfood, of Right and Wrong, of Good and Evil: They were great Men, Mr. Prim, who were of that Opinion, very great Men, it must be confeffed. I can only obServe, that, as thefe Natures are ever fixt, and Fafiion (as you most judiciousty remark’d) is ever changing, it most evidently follows, that nothing is true, or right, or good, be-caufe "tis the FaSIiion ; or the Fashion, be-

Inducement
LETTER XL. 295
Inducement to you, to give us your Company here.
T o begin then with Politics, on which head I Shall be extremely short; The Administration of our public Affairs is, in my opinion, at preSent in the Hands of the very Men, whom you, and every honest PerSon would wish to be intrusted with it. Amongst thofe, tho’ there is no abSolute Prime Minister, yet there is one, whofe Genius must always make him the Superior in every Society, as he hath joined to the most penetrating Wit, the clearest Judgment both in Men and Things, and the profoundest Knowledge of them, of any Man, whom, perhaps the World ever Saw.
This is indeed multum in pafvo^ and will be abundantly Sufficient to cheer you in that Love, which I know you fincerely bear your Country z for this will thrive in every different Branch, as the Several Branches are governed and diredled by Men of proper and adequate Ability.

LETTER XL.
And, if Arguments a pojieriore may corroborate the Opinion I have above given, Surely we are furniShed with great Plenty. What but a Genius of the highest kind could hav-e preServed Ireland in a perSed State of Tranquillity and Obedience during the late Troubles! Or what could have restored this Nation from that drooping and languid Fit of Defpair, which So lately appeared in every honest Countenance, to thoSe chearful Expectations, which the present ProSpeCl of Things affords us
From the abovementioned ReaSon, I fuppofe you will conclude, that the great and important Article of Religion is in the most fiourilhing Situation; and, to Say the Truth, as to the external Part, which most properly belongs to the Heads of the Church to regulate, there is no apparent Deficiency; but with regard to Morality, which may be considered as the internal Part, I freely own, I believe no Age or Nation was ever funk to a more deplorable State.
One
LETTER XL.
297
One great CauSe of this, I conceivo may be that Luxury which of late Years hath rolled in like a Deluge upon us: For the greatest Estates being barely SuS-ficient to Satisfy the Demands of So outrageous a Monster, the Hearts of the Opulent are of necessity Shut to the Wants of their Fellow-Creatures, and Liberality, nay even Hofpitality, are banished from among US; while Men of fmaller Fortunes are pushed on to all Adfs of Meannefs and Mifcre-antifm, in order to Supply themSelves with the Means of imitating their Superiors. Hence arifes a total Difregard to all true Honour and Honesty; hence every kind of Corruption and Prostitution, no Man being ashamed of any thing but the Appearance of Poverty.
Now whence doth this proceed, but from our Morals being in wrong Hands ? true Wit and Genius being in a manner de-poSed, and Impostors advanced in their place.
In
298
LETTER XL.
In reality, what the Ministry are to the State, the Bishops to the Church, the Chancellor and Judges to the Law, the Generals to the Army, and the Admirals to the Fleet; that is a great and good Writer over the Morals oS his Countrymen.
The Truth of this Observation will appear, if it be confidered, that there is a strid; Analogy between the Taste and Morals of an Age ; and Depravity in the one always induces Depravity in the other.
True Taste is indeed no other than the Knowledge of what is right and fit in every thing. It cannot be imagined therefore, that one capable, of difcerning this in all leffer Matters, should be unable to perceive it in that highest and noblest Objest the Human Mind.
When therefore we fee a falSe Taste prevail in all things elSe, we may naturally conclude it exists here likewiSe.
The
LETTER XL.
299
The first great Corrupters of our Taste are the VirtuoSo’s, a Sort of People with which we abound to So prodigious a degree, that their Dexterities engrofs almost our whole Converfation, Thefe are a kind of burleSque natural PhiloSophers, whofe Endeavours are not to difcover the Beauties, but the Oddities and Frolicks of Nature. They are indeed a Sort of natural Jugglers, whofe BufineSs it is to elevate and furprize, not to Satisfy, inform, or entertain.
The next great Bufinefs of the Age is Mustek; of our Taste in which I need Say no more, to give you an adequate Idea, than barely to inform you we have Operas, in which Mr. Handel is totally filent.
Architecture, Painting and Sculpture cannot fail of Encouragement in an Age devoted to Luxury. In thefe therefore we imitate the Extravagance of the Romans^ and the Delicacy of the Goths.
These however assist in forming the Subjects of our Conversation j and it is dif-3	ficult
300 LETTER XL.
ficult to find a fingle PerSon who is not a Connoiffeur in them all j and this oSten without knowing the common Rules oS the Art in which he affects to be a Judge.
I C o M E now to the Theatres, oS which you will doubtleSs expect a more Savourable Account. And indeed our Actors promiSe no leSs ; many oS theSe being equal to any oS their Predeceffors, and Some, I believe, Superior to any who have ever been. But So artfully is the Theatre conducted in the Choice of Plays, and the Casting of Parts, that I have Seldom Sufficient Inticement to vifit it.
Half a dozen Tragedies, two of which were Jane Shore and the Fair Penitent., furnished the Entertainment of a Month this Winter at Covent-Garden: So that we were obliged either to vifit the Theatre Seldom, or to be dieted with the Same Dish. Nor did Drury-Lane give us any Relief; for that Theatre, instead of treating us with another kind of Dramatical Food, very wifely attempted to emulate the best Actors of Covent-Garden in their best Parts; and
vainly
LETTER XL.
301
vainly endeavoured to rival one who never had, nor, I believe, ever will have an Equal.
How much more judicious would it have been in that HouSe to have applied themSelves to the Revival of Several of our old Comedies, to which their Company is So well adapted. Mr. Barry^ who Seems to have all the Materials of a good Adlor, might then have gained Applaufe, without the Danger of a difadvantageous Com-parifon. Mr. Cibber and Mr. Macklin could not have failed of pleafing; nor would the vast Genius of Mrs. Clive (inimitable in all Humour) have been lost and forgotten by the Folly and Ingratitude of the Town.
IT is pity, I think, that the Legifiature do not interfere, and put the Condudf of this So noble. So rational, and So uSeful a Diverfion, into Hands more capable of conducing it • by which means public En-tertainment and Example might be rather considered in Theatrical Performances, than the acquiring immenSe Fortunes to private PerSons, who will make it more their Bu-
fineSs
302 LETTER XL.
fineSs to indulge, than to correct a vicious or bad Taste, when Such prevails.
Till Something of this kind is done, the Theatre can never truly flourish, nor the World reap So much either of theUSe-ful or the Delightful from it, as it is capable of affording; but the Fustian of Lee and Rowe.^ with French and Italian Buffbonry, will in a great meafure monopolize the Stage.
This Regulation is then to be wished; but I am afraid it is to be defpaired of: For as to the few truly Great Men whom this Age hath produced, either the Necessity of the Times, or their own Inclinations, have totally diverted them from any Thoughts of this kind. They are themSelves far from wanting Taste, (for none can be in reality a Great Man without it) but they will give themfelves no trouble to reform that of the Public ; thinking it probably of much leSs conSequence to the Good of Society than it hath always appeared to the Wife of former Times.
And
LETTER XL.
303
And if the Theatres be totally overlooked by them, it is no wonder that every other Branch of the Republic of Letters should meet with equal DiSregard. This is notoriousty the Cafe; for I think I may affirm with Truth, that there is no one Patron of true Genius, nor the least Encouragement left for it in this Kingdom.
IF I was writing to a Sneerer, I might apprehend he would anfwer, by inverting the Complaint, and fay, that there was no true Genius at preSent to patronize.
This in fadt is not the Cafe; but admit that it was, the ReaSon would still be the Want of Encouragement; and indeed I may here apply the Anfwer of a Gardener to his covetous Master, who was angry that he had no Cucumbers in his Garden : How Jhould you have Cucumbers^ Sir, Said the Gardener, when you know you would not afford a Hot-Bed to raife them in f
Plants
3^4
LETTER XL.
Plants of this tender kind should be careSully watched^ when they first appear, and placed in warm Situations, if we ex-pedl any ripe and good Fruit from them. The cold Air of Negledt nips and destroys them; nor can their Shoots be ever strong and flourishing in a poor hungry Soil, which denies them Nourishment at the Root.
There have been indeed fome Instances of Men of a very rare and Angular Strength of Genius, which (to refume my Allegory) have flourished in the poorest Soil, and bid defiance to the frosty Breath of the World ; but they make a very thin Appearance in History : and even of thefe few or none perhaps ever arrived at the full Perfection of which they were capable.
Till fome Patron then of the MuSes shall again ariSe in this Nation, you will not be very curious in inquiring after their Productions. When I meet with any Performance untainted with ProfaneneSs, Indecency, Slander, or Dulnefs, I will certainly fend it you.
One

One Particular, I think, now only remains to be Spoken to; namely, the private AmuSement of Pcnshns in their own HouSes. This, my Friend, confists of one Article only, viz. WhiSk, a Game So uni-verSally in vogue, that there are few PerSons who do not play two or three Rubbers every Day.
Several get a Livelihood, and others of confequence injure their Fortunes by theSe means; but much the larger Number play with Such equal SucceSs, and for Such inconfiderable Stakes, that they loSe nothing more than the Card-Money and their Time.

Done into English.
Monjieur^
At Whitehall we took a Pair of Oars for Putney, TheSe we had indeed Some Difficulty to procure; for many refuted to go with us farther than Foxhall or Ranelagh Gardens. At last we prevailed with two Fellows for three Half-Crowns to take us on board.
I Have

I H Av E been told there was formerly a Law regulating the Fares of theSe People ; but that is to be Sure obSolete. I think it pity it was not revived.
As the Weather was extremely fine^ we did not regret the Tide’s running against us, fince by that means we had more Opportunity of making Observations on the finest River in the World except the Seine.
After taking a Survey of the New Bridge., which must be greatly admired by all who have not Seen the Pontneuf, we past by a Row of Buildings, not very remarkable for their Elegance, being chiefly built of Wood, and irregular. Many of them are Supported by Pillars-; but of what Order we could not plainly difcern.
W E came now to Lambeth, where is a Palace of the Archbishop of Canterbury, the Metropolitan of England. This is a vast Pile of Building, not very beautiful indeed in its Strudture, but wonderfully w ell calculated, as well to fignify, as to anSwer the U 2	USe
3o8 letter XLI.
USe for which it was, I SuppoSe, originally intended j containing a great Number of little Apartments for the Reception of travelling and distreffed Chrijiians.
Lambeth is perhaps So called from Lamh^ which is the Type of MeekneSs.
The next Place of Note, as we afcend this River, is Fox-Hall, or rather Fox-Hole, the first Syllable of which is corrupted into Vaux by the Vulgar, who tell a foolish Story of one Vaux who refided here, 4nd attempted to blow up the Thamet’ But the true Reading is Fox-Hole, as ap* pears by an antient Piece of Painting, representing that Animal whence it takes its Name, and which is now to be Seen on a high wooden Pillar, Anglice a Sign-Post, not far from the Landing-Place.
A V E R Y little further stands Marble-Hall, of which we had a full View from the Water. This is a most august Edifice, built all of a rich Marble, which ressecsting the Sun-Beams, creates anObjedt too dazling for the Sight.

Having passed this, we were entertained with a most Superb Piece of Archi-teisture of white, or rather yellow Brick. This belongs to one of the Bourgeois, as do indeed most of the Villas which border on both fides this River, and they tend to give as magnificent an Idea of the Riches which stow in to thefe People by Trade, as the Shipping doth, which is to be feen below the Bridge of London.
Hence a Range of most delicious Meadows begins to open, which, being richly enamelled with Flowers of all kinds, Seem to contend whether they shall convey most PleaSure to your Sight or to your Smell. Our Contemplation was however diverted from this Scene by a Boat, in which v/ere two young Ladies extremely handfome, who accosted us in Some PhraSe which we, who thought ourfelves pretty good Masters of the Englijh Tongue, did not understand. They were anSwered however by our Watermen, who afterwards told us, that tbig is called Water-Language ; and confequent^ ly, I fuppofe, not to be learn’d on Shore.

The next Place which preSents itSelS on the Surry Side (for I reServe the other Shore for my Return) is the pleaSant Village of Batterfea; the true Reading of which we conjectured to be Betterfee; and that it was formerly a Bishoprick, and had the Preference to Shelfee., of which we shall fpeak anon. It is chiefly famous at preSent for affording a Retreat to one of the greatest Statefmen of his Time, who hath here a magnificent Palace.
From Betterfee^ verging to the South-West, stands TVanfory as it is vulgarly called; but its true Name was undoubtedly IVindmill-Shore^ from whence it is a very eaSy Corruption ; and feveral Windmills are yet to be found in its Neighbourhood. Here are to be feen a Parish-Church, and Some Houfes; but it is otherwise little worth the Curiofity of Travellers.
As you Sail from hence, two loftyTowers at once falute your Eyes from oppofite Shores of the River, divided by a magnificent wooden Bridge, That on the Surry
Shore
LETTER XLI. 311
Shore is called Putney or Putnigh, a fair and beautiful Town, conSisting principally of one vast Street, which extends from North to South, and is adorned with most beautiful Buildings.
Here we went ashore, in order to regale ourSelves in one of their HouSes of Entertainment, as they are called; but in reality there is no Entertainment at them. Here were no Tarts nor Cheefecakes, nor any fort of Food but an Englijh Dish called Breadandcheefe, and Some raw Flesh.
But if it be difficult to find any thing to allay Hunger, it is still more fo to quench your Thirst. There is a Liquor Sold in this Country which they call Wine, (most of the Inhabitants indeed call it Wind.) Of what Ingredients it is compoSed I cannot tell; but you are not to conceive, as the Word Seems to import, that this is a Translation of om French Word Vin., a Liquor made of the Juice of the Grape ; for I am very well assured there is not a Drop of any Such Juice in it. There must be many Ingredients in this Liquor, from the many U 4	different

different Tastes; Some of which are Sweet, others Sour, and others bitter; but though it appeared So nauSeous to me and my Friend, that we could not Swallow it, the Engltjh relish it very well; nay, they will often drink a Gallon of it at a Sitting; and Sometimes in their Cups (for it intoxicates) will wantonly give it the Names of all our best Wines.

this Country, in whatever HouSe you eat or drink, whether private or public, you are obliged to pay the Servants a Fee at your Departure, otherwise they certainly affront you.
These Fees are called Vails; and they Serve instead of Wages : for though in private Houfes the Master generally contracts with his Servant to give him Wages, yet thefe are Seldom or never paid; and indeed the Vails commonly amount to much more.
From Putnigh we crossed over to the other Shore, where stands the fair and beautiful Town of Pull home^ vulgarly called Fulham. It is principally remarkable for being, the Refidence of a BiShop; but a large Grove of Trees prevented our feeing his Palace from the Water.
These two Towns were founded by two Sisters; and they received their Names from the following Occasson. Thefe Ladies being on the Surry Shore, called for a Boat to convey them acrofs the Water. The Watermen being fomewhat lazy, and not
coming
314 LETTER XLI.
coming near enough to the Land, the Lady who had Sounded the Town which stands in Surry, bid them put nigh; upon which her Sister irnmediately cried out, A good Omen j let Putnigh be the Name of the Place. When they came to the other Side, She who had founded the other Town, ordered the Watermen to push the Boat full home', her Sister then returned the Favour, and gave the Name of Full home to the Place.
Here stands a most stately and magnificent Bridge. We inquired of the Watermen by whoSe Benefadion this was built. Benefaflion, do you call it ? Says one of shem with a Sneer; I heartily wifh iKhad been by mine; there hath been a fine Parcel of Money got by that J o b ; a Name which the Englijh give to all Works of a public Nature : For So grateful are theSe People, that nobody ever doth any thing for the Public, but he is certain to make his Fortune by it.
W E now returned by the Shore of MN-dlefex, and pasted by Several beautiful Meadows where the new-mow’d Hay would 3	have

have wonderfully delighted our Smell, had it not been for a great Variety of dead Dogs, Cats, and other Animals, which being plentifully bestrewed along this Shore, a good deal abated the SweetneSs which must have otherwise impregnated the Air.
W E at length arrived at Shelfee, a Corruption from Shallow Seefor the Word fallow fignifies empty, worthlefs. Thus a Jhallow Purfe and a Jhallow Fellow are Words of Contempt. This, formerly, was doubt-leSs a Small Bishoprick, and inferior to that on the other Side the Water, which was called Betterfee.
.Here are many things worthy the Cu-riofity of Travellers. This Place is famous for the Refidence of Don Saltero, a Spanijh Nobleman, who hath a vast Colledlion of all Sorts of Rarities; but we had not time to See them.
Here is likewiSe a Walk called Para^ dife-Row, from the delightful Situation, and the magnificent Buildings with which it is adorned. We had certainly gone on stivore
to
3i6 LETTER XLI.
to admire the Beauty of this Walk; but here being no Landing-Place, we must have Spoiled our Stockings, by stepping into the Mud ; and were befides informed, that the Road was fo abominably dirty, that it would be difficult to crofs; the rather, as it Seemed entirely stopped up by a great Number of Dust-Carts.
A Little farther stands an Hofpi-tal, or rather a Palace, for the Reception of old and wounded Soldiers. A Benefaction of So noble a kind, that it really doth honour to the Englijh Nation. Here are Some very beautiful Apartments, which they told us belonged to the Officers; a Word which led us into a Mistake, as we afterwards discovered: For we imagined that theSe Apartments were allotted to thoSe Gentlemen who had borne Commiffions in the Army, and who had, by being diSabled in the Service, entitled themSelves to the public Favour ; but on farther Inquiry, we were Surprized to find there was no Provifion at all for any Such 3 and that theSe Officers were a certain Number of
Placemen,
LETTER XLL 317
Placemen, who had never borne Arms, nor had any military Merit whatever.
Beyond this stands Ranelagh^ of which we stiall Say no more, than that it is a very large round Room, and will contain abundance of People. This is indeed a Sufficient Recommendation to the Englijh^ who never inquire farther into the Merit of any Diverfion, when they hear it is very much frequented. A Humour, of which we faw many Instances: all their publick Places being either quite empty of Company, or So crouded, that we could hardly get to them.
Hence failing by a Shore where we faw little very remarkable. Save only the Carcasses of Animals, which were here in much greater plenty than we had before found them, we arrived at a Place called MilUBmk or Mile-Bank; and Soon after we pasted, as we were informed, by the Senate-Houfes: but though we went within a few Yards of them, we could not diScern with any Certainty which were they.
Having

LETTER XLL
Having again Shot (as they call it) the New Bridge, we Saw the Palace of a Nobleman, who hath the Honour to be a Duke of Prance as well as of England, and the HappineSs to be greatly esteemed in both Countries.
Near this Palace stands that of another Duke, who, among other great and good Qualities, is reputed the most benevolent Man in the World.
A Little further we Saw the Palace of an Earl, of a very high Charader likewise among his Countrymen; and who, in Times of Corruption, hath maintained the Integrity of an old Roman.
The Palaces of theSe three Noblemen, who do a real Honour to their high Rank, and who are greatly beloved and reSpected by their Country, are extremely elegant in their Buildings, as well as delightful in their Situation; and, to be fincere, are the only Edifices that diScover any true Taste, which we Saw in all our Voyage.
We

W E now approached to Hungerford-Stairs, the Place destined for our landing; \ where we were entertained with a Sight very common, it Seems, in this Country: This was the ducking a Pickpocket. When we were first told this, we imagined it might be the Execution of Some legal Sen tence ; but we were informed, that his Executioners had been like wife his Judges.
T o give you Some Idea of this, (for it is impossible for any one who doth not live in what they call a free Country, to have an adequate Notion of a Mob) whenever a Pickpocket is taken in the Fadf, the PerSon who takes him calls out Pickpocket. Upon which Word, the Mob, who are always at hand in the Street, assemble; and having heard the Accufation, and Sometimes the Defence, (though they are not always very stridf as to the latter, judging a good deal by Appearances) if they believe the Ac-cuSer, the PriSoner is Sentenced to be ducked; and this Sentence is immediately executed with Such Rigour, that he hardly eScapes with his Life.
The
320 LETTER XLI.
The Mob take Cognizance oS all other Misdemeanors which happen in the Streets, and they are a Court, which generally, endeavours to do Justice, tho’ they Sometimes err, by the HastineSs of their Deci-fions. Perhaps it is the only Court in the World, where there is no Partiality arissng from ReSpedt of PerSons.
They are great Enemies to the USe of Swords, as they are Weapons with which they are not intrusted. If a Gentleman draws a Sword, tho’ it be only in terro-rem to defend himSelf, he is certain to be very feverely treated by them; but they give great Encouragement to their Superiors, who will condefcend to shew their Courage in the way which the Mob them-felves uSe, namely, by Boxing, of which we shall presently shew you an Instance.
Our Boat was now with Some difficulty clofe to the Landing-place ; for there was a great Croud of Boats, every one of which, instead of making way for us. Served
to
LETTER XLI. 321 to endeavour to keep us out. Upon this occafion many hundred CurSes passed between our Watermen and their Fellows, and not a Sew Affronts were cast on us, especially as we were drest after the manner of our Country.
At last we arrived Safe on shore, where we paid our Watermen, who grumbled at our not giving them Something to drink> (for all the labouring People of this Country apply their Hire only to Eatables, for which reafon they expedt fomething over and above to drink.)
As we walked towards the Strand^ a Drayrrian run his Whip diredtly into my Friend’s Face, perhaps with no Defign of doing this, but at the fame time, without any Defign of avoiding it. My Friend, who is impatient of an Affront, immediately struck the Carter with his Fist, who attempted to return the Favour with his Whip; but Monfieur Bellair., who is extremely strong and adlive, and who hath learnt to box in this Country, prefently cloSed in with him, and tript up his Heels.
VoL. II.	X	The
522 letter xli.
The Mob now affembled round us, and being pleaSed with my Friend Sor not having drawn his Sword, inclined viSibly to his fide, and commended many Blows which he gave his AdverSary, and other Feats of Adtivity which he diSplayed during the Combat, that lasted Some Minutes ; at the End of which, the Drayman yielded up the Vidtory, crying with a Sneer —
D-----n you^ you have been on the St age ^ or
I am mijiaken.
The Mob now gave a Huzza in my Friend’s favour, and Sufficiently upbraided his Antagonist, who, they Said, was well enough Served for affronting a Gentleman.
Monsi e u R Bellair had on the Begin-iiing of the Scuffle, while the Enemy lay on the Ground, delivered his Sword to one of the By-standers; which Perfon had unluckily walked off in the Croud, without remembring to restore it.
Upon this the Mob raged violently, and Swore Vengeance against the Thief, if
he
L E T t r R XLI. 323
he cbiild be diSebvered r but, as this could hot be dohe, he was obliged at length to fubinit to the LoSs.
When we began to depart, Several of our Friends demanded of trs Something to drinkbut, as vre wef6 more out of humour with the LoSs, than pleafed with the Glory obtained, we could not be prevailed with to open our PurSes.
The Company were incenSed at this. We were Saluted with the Titles of Moun--/hire, and other contemptuous Appellations; Several missile Weapons, Such as Dirt, began like wife to play on us, and we were both challenged to fight by Several, who told my Friend, tho’ he beat the Drayman, he was not above half a Man.
W E then made the best of our way, and Soon eScaped into a Hackney-Coach.
Thus I have Sent you a particular Account of this Voyage, from Some Parts of which you may perhaps conclude, that the meanest Rank of People are in this Coun-X 2	‘	try

try better provided for, than their Superiors ; and that the Gentry, at least thoSe of the lower ClaSs of that Order, fare full as well in other Places; for, to fay the truth, it appears to me, that an Englijhman in that Station, is liable to be opprest by all above him, and inSulted by all below him. v

Dear Lucy,
IS H O U L D have writ to you Sooner, according, to my PromiSe, but I have not had one moment’s Time fince I came to Town, till now; and, if I had not taken the opportunity of a Sunday, I don’t believe I Should have been able to write till I had Seen you, which I hope, my Dear, will be a long Time hence, unleSs you can perfuade your Papa to let you come to Town.
X
Well
326 LETTER XLII.
Well then, to begin. After a tedious Journey of five Days, my Papa and Mamma, and mySelf and Alicf^ arrived SaSe in charming London. Poor Mamma was lick upon the Road, and could not eat j So we brought half our Cake, almost a whole Turkey, great Part of a Ham, and a Mutton-Pye quite through.
And now, my Dear, I must tell you, we have taken a Lodging in PalLMally which is to ferve us for the prefent; but my Mamma fays it won’t do, for she wants a whole Houfe to herfelf in Thingamy-Square. Papa looks a little grim, but I believe Manama will get the better, for She has cryed about it twice already.
I H A y E been only at four Plays yet. So I can’t give you much Opinion about them; but the Elay-HouSe is a charming Place, I can affure you; Suph a many Candles rpakes one look So gim ; and there is Such a Number of fine Gentlemen, I never faw. And the Player-Men are fine Men too, and prqdigiousty well drest : There is one Sweet
Man
LETTER XLII. 327
Man among them ; I wanted to hear him talk; but, tho’ he came upon the Stage Several times, he never once opened his Mouth. He is a Sweet Man ; but this is not he, that all the Ladies are in love with; for there is one Mr. Grick, that every body talks of, but nobody could tell me the Name of my Man, and yet he is taller than Mr. Grick by almost a Foot, I warrant you : I afk’d a young Lady, who Sat by me, his Name, and She anSwered me, he was nobody; I affure her he was handfomer than any body.
O, But, my Dear, I must tell you; there is one Colonel Sprucely., who is got So well acquainted with Mamma already, that they are almost always together, especially when Papa’s not at home. I am always Sent out of the Room when he comes; but if I had my handSome Player-Man with me, I should not envy her his Company.
I Warrant you will stare, to hear me ovrn I think a Man handSome; but it X 4	is
328 LETTER XLII.
is all the Fashion, and there is no harm in it here : I was a little ashamed the first day or two, but good Company Soon teaches us better. Dear Lucy, do, come to Town; for a Country Girl is a horrible aukward Creature.
O, Dear London, it is quite another World. Was I to mention half our Diver-fions to you, you would not even know the Names of them. Here are Drums, and Routs, and Hurricanes. Mamma intends to have a Drum, as Soon as we get into a tolerable HouSe; for we have but one poor nasty Dining-Room, where we are, and a Drum can’t be made without three, at least.
I Warrant now, I have Set you a gueshng what a Drum is; nay, I’ll leave you a thouSand Years to gueSs what it is made of—To Satisfy your Curiofity then, it is made of a great many Rooms, and a great many Tables, and a great many Candles, and a great many People—O, ’tis a charming thing: and, as Mamma told
Papa,
LETTER XLII. 329 Papa, we had better be out of the World, than not have a Drum.
O, But I promised to write about the Court; ay, but we have not been able to go there yet : for, tho’ Mamma laid out So much Money in Clothes last Year, every thing must be pulled to pieces, before it will do. Would you believe it, Child, my best Hoop wants above three Yards of being any thing decent. Not one Rag of our Laces will do, for they are not near fine enough to be Seen in; So we have thrown away a fine deal of Money as well as Time, to no purpoSe in the Country; but Mrs. Modijh the Millener, and Mrs. Labby the Manteau-Maker, have promised to remedy all Soon; So, that iir about a Week more, we hope to be fit to appear in the best Company. My Mamma’s Clothes will be prodigioufiy hand-Some: the Silk cost above three Pounds a Yard. Papa was at first a little out of humour at the Price, but three Ladies happening to come in just at the Time, made all that, matter eaSy, by telling him,
it

330 LETTER XLII.
it was the csheapest Thing they ever Saw in their Lives. She has beSpake two other Gowns and Petticoats, which Papa knows nothing of; for Mamma Says, Ihe may very likely win Money enough to pay for them. I have new Clothes beSpoke too, but they are So Shockingly plain, I am aShamed to mention them. But now T must tell you a Secret. I was at the Opera last Night, and more fine Gentlemen talked to me, than to any of the finest drest Ladies there-—I aSTure you, Mifs; nay, they admired my Clothes too, I pro-mife you, and yet I had only the old Shocker on: thinks I to mySelf, you will like me better Soon. As for the Opera it-Self, I did not understand a Word of it, and I had rather hear you Sing the Lafs by the Brow of the Hill; but Mamma fays, every body likes it, and So I like it too; for, to be genteel, you must do what every body does.
I Believe I had more to tell you; but the Colonel is just gone, and Mamma has Sent for me—and just this minute there

is a great Rap at the Door. I believe Some People of Quality are coming up, So in haste, I conclude.

From Mifs Lucy Rural to Mifs Prudentia Flutter.
Dear Prue,
IH A V E been detained from reading your agreeable Letter the whole Evening, by being in Some very merry Company, where we have had a Game of Chrijimafs Gambols: Jack Bonny was with us; and you know his comical Humour never fails of making every body happy where he is. And to Say the truth, my Dear, I believe you have not Spent So pleaSant an Evening fince you left us.
Indeed
LETTER XLIIL
333
Indeed, dear Frue, So far from having my Opinion raiSed of the Town Pleafures, by what you write, I am the more convinced of the Impertinence and Stupidity of a Town-Life; and that we are not only more innocent, but much more merry and happy in the Country.
As to Plays, which are the only rational Amufement you mention, you know I am very fond of them, and have often an Opportunity of feeing them within two Miles of our Houfe. I confeSs, they are probably better adted in London; but don’t be angry if I fay, this Circumstance Seems to have added very little to your Entertainment. I dare Swear, we have as good Adlors as that dumb Gentleman you mention, whom I SuppoSe to have been one of the Gentlemen UShers to Alexander the Greator Some other Hero; and am very Sorry, he has made So deep an Impref-fion on your Mind, which I impute to the notorious Demerit of the Beaus, of whom, from the Accounts I have received, I have no very high Opinion.
Sure
334 letter XLIII.
Sure the Opera must be a very wretched Entertainment, or ybu Would neVee Suffer Such Animals to divert your Attention from it.
I Own, myL>ear, I have not much Idea of a Drum; and you’ll pardon me, if I Say, you don’t Seem to entertain any very per-fedt Notion of it yourSelf: However, I will endeavour to explain a Diverfion to you, in which I Spent three Eveniilgs in the Chriflmafi Holidays, ancS which I shall call a Trumpet; partly, in allufibii to your Drum, and partly, as it was our chief In^ strument of Mufic; tho’ I do not find, you can give So good a ReaSon for the Name of your Affembly.
You must know then, that on the Day after Chrijlmafs^ I dined at Sir Lhomas IIeartf^ where we had a great deal of good Company. There were prefent. Sir Sthomas and my Lady, who are, you know, a very fond Couple, greatly happy in them-Selves, and very defirous of Seeing every other PerSon So ; the other Men were. Sir Roger Fairfield, Mr. Woodly, Mr. Green, 3	Mr.
LETTER XLIIL 335
Mr. "JoneSy Dr. Gaylove, Jack Bonny, and Sir Thomas's Chaplain: the Women were, befides her Ladyship of the HouSe, Old Lady Cheerful, Mrs. Woodly, Mrs. Green, MiSs Fairfield, MiSs Cheerful, MiSs Jenny Fairfield, MiSs Betfy Fairfield, and your humble Servant.
While we were at our Tea, Sir Tho^ mas came to us from the Men, and pro-poSed a Diverfion for the Evening, which was readily agreed to by the whole Company. This was a Trumpet, or, to explain it to you in a Term you are better acquainted with, it was to go a mumming.
Two Hours were now Spent in dressing ourSelves, and, I do assure you, they were two very agreeable ones. My Lady Cheerful, who has, you know, all the Good-humour, without any of the Passions of Youth, was drest up for the Witch of Endear, and made a Figure So ridiculous, that I can hardly help laughing, when I recoiled it. Let me tell you, it is no little Indication of Good-fenfe and Good-nature too, in a Woman of any Age, to Submit
to
336 LETTER XLIIL
to make her PerSon diSagreestble. MiS§ Betty Fairfield was drest as a ShepherdeSs, and made a most lovely Appearance. Your humble Servant conSented to be a Nun, but remember it was only in jest.
A T Seven in the Evening, we were joined by the Men, who had likewiSe diS-guiSed themSelves in various antic Dreffes. Every Man choSe his Woman, as well as he could gueSs, Sor we were all maSqued. Sir Lhomas fell to the share of the Witch, and your Friend the Nun became the Property of Friar Jack Bonny.
A Wa ggon and Six now attended at the Gate, to which we were led by our Several Partners; a Band of Mufic, with a Trumpet at their head, preceding.
Sir Lhomas undertook to be Master of the Ceremonies, and the Waggon was ordered to drive to Mr. Warmgrovd.which is, you know, about three Miles distant from Sir Lhomas's. It is almost impoffible to deScribe the PleaSantneSs of our Ride; Mufic and Lights made the Gloom of the
Night
LETTER XLIir, 337
Night more delightful than the Day ; and So much Good-humour, Mirth, and Wit too, I promiSe you, prevailed in our Waggon, that our Journey past almost in one continual Laugh. Perhaps there is not a more agreeable Creature upon Earth, than yack Bonny%
Well; when we arrived at Mrs Wafnu grove's, we found a large Hall well lighted up with a Swinging Fire prepared for us; for Sir Thomas, who has a great deal of true Politenefs, without any of the Foppery which pastes for it in Some Places, had Sent timely notice to his Friend of our Intention. We were received at the Gate* by Mr. Warmgrove and his Lady, and conducted into the Hall, where Wine and Cakes were immediately brought us, With thefe having regaled ourfelves for Some time, and fome Scenes of Mirth having pasted, on account of the Mistakes which were made in guestes at our Several Persons, the Ball was begun by Mr. Wartn^^ grove and Mrs. Greet?, who was drest in a Suit of Lady Hearty's Clothes, and past for her all the first Part of the Night. VoL. II.	y	At
238 LETTER XLIII.
At Twelve we were conducted to a noble Supper, where we all unmaSk’d, and the Night concluded with So much Mirth and Jollity, that I believe no Set of Company ever past a pleafanter.
We have fince had two more Frolics of the Same kind, of which I will not tire you with the Repetition ; tho’ Sir Lhomas^ who has shewn an excellent Taste for theSe Diverfions, took care to give them a Variety, which greatly added to their Entertainment.
And now, my Dear, what do you think was the ConSequence of all this ? Why, Sir Roger hath very honourably declared himSelf to MiSs Cheerful,, and MiSs Betty Fairfield hath received a formal Vifit from the Do(5tor; but, what is worst of all, I wish the poor Nun be not Seduced by a wicked Friar to forSake the holy Veil. To be short, and to shew you, we Country Girls can Sometimes own what we are not ashamed of, as well as you Town Ladies, if I write you after next Lhurfday, 1 shall fign my Letter by a strange Name,
If
LETTER XLIir. 339
If you Should laugh at all this, as Country Simplicity, or whatever elSe you pleaSe to call it, I Shall have the SatiS-Sadtion oS thinking, I have afforded you what the Town cannot; for, by your Letter, you do not Seem to have laughed Since you left us. If you meet with any thing moi’e entertaining, I know you will readily communicate it to your Friends; if not, we Shall have the PleaSure of ex~ pedting you the fooner, which, I do affure . you, will be most acceptable to.

Though lll- natured Accidents Sometimes tear the PerSon of my dearest Creature from my Eyes, nothing can remove her, even for a Moment, from my Thoughts*
This I am certain She believes; and, unluckily for me, it is no Secret to the rest of my Acquaintance* Hence 1 become often the Mark of that Raillery with which all People are armed against Love; a Paf-fion which no one will condefcend to own t for fuch a Confestion would reflect on the Modesty of your Sex, and Men confider it as no lefs an Imputation on their Understanding,
LETTER XLIV. 341
I Must, however, do the Ladies the Justice to own, that many of them haye feenSe enough to deSpiSe this foolish Opinion, and are not ashamed of being known to love their Hushands: But I am afraid the pxamples pf Spch Sincerity on our fide are much rarer: For I folemnly declare, thp’ I know feveral who love their Wives with great FondneSs, I Scarce know one who is pot ashamed of Sp doing.
This Treatment of a Paffion to which I owe the Sweetest PleaSures of my Life, always raifes in me much Indignation; and I never fail on Such Occafions of defending the injured CauSe, and of becoming the Champion of Love ; though I generally meet with the Fate which attends all Op-pofers of vulgar Errors, and have the Re^ ward of being laughed at.
I Yesterday encountered a large Cpm-^ pany of both Sexes on this Subjejst; which I had introduced, by having drank your Health in a Bumper. I will not trouble you with the many BlaSphemtes (for So I y 3	call
342 LETTER XLIV.
call them) which were uttered against the divine Pafiion we both cultivate; but shall draw up my Argument into the Form of a Speech, and wiU leave it to your Judgment whether it could or could not be answered.
Suppose me then to have made the following Speech an the Occafion:
“lam Surprized at notlfing more, than “ that Love hath ever been reputed Folly, “ or that Men should uSe Words with Such “ Impropriety, as to call it a WeakneSs of “ the Mind.
“ That to purfue perfedl Happinefs, if ' we were capable of it, would be WiS-dom, no one will, I believe, have the ‘ Confidence to deny; and if perfedl Hap-‘ pineSs be not attainable in this World, to ‘ acquire to yourfelf the highest Degree of ' human HappineSs, must, I think, be ' esteemed the highest Degree of human
■ WiSdom.
“Now, in my eye. Love appears alone ' capable of bestowing on m this highest
“ Degree
LETTER XLIV. 343 ** Degree of human Felicity. I Solemnly “ declare, when I am in poffeffion of my ‘‘ Wife, (here was a great Laugh) my “ Happinefs wants no Addition. I think I may aver, it could receive none. I “ conceive myfelf then to be the hap-piest of Mankind; I am Sure I am as happy as it is possible for me to be.
“It may be, perhaps, objected, that I “ have Set myfelf up as the Standard of “ true Judgment: that though I should be “ fincere in what 1 Say, yet this, whicl-i is.So “ great a Blessing in my Estimation, may “ in the Opinion of another be a very flight “ and indifferent Matter; and that it ap-“ pears otherwife to me, may be Said to “ ariSe from that very WcakneSs of Mind “ of v/hich I v/ould, avoid the Imputation,
“ I Shall endeavour therefore to evince “ by ReaSon, that Love, in the Mind which “ possesses it in the highest Degree, must “ create the highest Degree of human “ Happinefs.

First,

LETTER XLIV.
First, then, it Seems to me, that the full Gratification oS thatPafiion which is uppermost in our Minds, is the highest y HappineSs of which we arc capable.
‘'Secondly, it Seems likewiSe, that one • ‘ Man is capable of being happier than another, in proportion as the Pafiion by which he is possessed (if I may So ex-“ preSs mySelf) is more or leSs capable of this full Gratification,
“ Let us examine then by this Rule thoSe two great Motives to the Actions of Men, which in modern Language are “ called Paffions, Ambition and Avarice : and if we can Shew the Advantage which “ Love hath oyer theSe, it will be abunr dantly Sufficient to found thoSe Argu-“ ments which will effectually prove what “ we have undertaken to prove, ^iz. that “ Love is not Folly, nor ought any Man to f‘ be aShamed pf its Pofieffion and In-“ fluence.
“ Now when vre confider the great Miseries which Ambidon and Avarice “ produce
LETTER XLIV. 345
produce to the World, we may, I think, reasonably expedl, th^t tliey should at the Same time make Some amends by the Good which they convey to the Bo-Soms which they inhabit,
“ Whether they do this or no, I shajl ' not enter into a Common-place Inquiry ;;
■	it is Sufficient Sor my PurpoSe here, that
■	neither of them are capable of a full
' Gratification : indeed, we may Say, of
■	any Gratification at all, fince every Ac-' quifition to them both brings Defire along ' with it: Defires which enlarge them-' Selves in proportion to the Good ob-' tained, and which exceed all Poffibility ' of obtaining in th^ Same Degree as what ‘ is already acquired hath exceeded Ex-‘ pedfation. Instead of proving this from ‘ any trite known Stories, wifh which all ‘ Books, both of History and others ‘ abound, I shall appeal for the Truth of it ‘ to common Experience, and to the Secret ‘ Information of every Man’s Breast, In
which either of theSe Paffions have py Place.
« In
346 LETTER XLIV.
In Lave it is far otherwise. This Sweet Passion admits of instant complete “ Gratification. Every Good conferred on, and received from, the beloved Objed:, “ fo fills the whole Mind with PleaSure, that it for a while leaves no WiSh unSa-“ tisfied. And if, after its Sweetest Sa-tieties, new Defires arife, thefe are not, “ like thoSe of Avarice and Ambition, “ restleSsuneaSy Perturbations; but So Sweet “ ‘and pleaSant, that they bring Some Re-“ wards along with them.
‘'If Love then Should appear more eligible than either Avarice or Ambition, as it is capable of receiving a fuller Gratification, we may likewiSe argue its ■ Superiority, as it is capable of this Gratification two ways ; either by giving or receiving Good; as it propoSes a certain End ;' as this End is generally not only possible, but eaSy, Safe, and innocent; Seldom attended with Difficulty, Danger, or Crime to ourSelves, or with any Mifchief to others. In every one oS which Lights

O F this Inclination to pleafe you, therefore, I will give you one Instance, by quitting a Subjedl which I could dwell on for ever, the delightful Contemplation of your Superiority; fince it is the only one in which I am capable of giving offence to her who is the Delight of my Eyes, the

VISION.
METHOUGHT I was conveyed into a large Plain; amohgst Such Multitudes oS Men and Women, that I could have no other Idea, than that all Mankind were assembled together.
At the End of this Plain; at a little distance frotn each other, were Sour prodigious large high Gates, with a Ticket on each in full view. On the First was written, The Way to Wealth; on the Second; The Way to Power; on the Third, The Way to Pleafure; and on the Fourth, The Way to Virtue, All the Company were employing themSelves, in reading theSe Several
Tickets jt
A VISION. 353
Tickets; but I obServed at the very Top of the Gates, other Words were written in Such Small Charatsters, that they were difficult to be distinguished; On the First, To Avarice; on the Second, To Ambition ; on the Third, To Difappointment; and on the Fourth, To Pride: but theSe Inscriptions were overlook’d by almost every Per-fon there.
I W A s almost deafned with the con-fuSed Din of the Multitude, every one arguing strenuoufiy, at which Gate it was best to enter: altho’ their Arguments might have been Spared : for their Choice had been vifibly fixed before by Inclination ; each having taken by the Hand the Guide, who Sat before that Gate which he, or she, from the first intended to enter.
Curiosity led me to wish, I could follow every Company; but, as that was impossible to do at once, I refolved to follow first, the Guide to Avarice; a Monster too deformed to be. deScribed: but in Patches up and down, on the Wretch’s tattered Rags was inScribed; I lead to TVealth. VoL. II. Z	TheSe
554 A V I S I O N.
Thefe Words, like a kind of Charm, blinded the Eyes of all our Company, and in them, the Shocking UglineSs of our Guide, whoSe Name, I afterwards found, was hour, was quite lost.
When the Gate was throwin open,^ we had the greatest Difficulty imaginable, to advance the first Step: They call it but one Step, altho’ it is a Hill So steep and craggy, that nothing but immenSe Pains could Surmount it; and the Difficulty was still increased by thoSe, who first .arrived at the Summit of the Hill; for it was their constant Custom to face about, and throw Stones at their Fellow-Travellers, in order to keep them down; nay, often-to keep down thofe very Perfons, by whoSe Affistance they had themfelves got up. Indeed I obferved, that, when any Set of People held together, and helped each other, it made the Way very eafy to them all: But the general Method was, to keep others down, tho’ at the Expence of deferring iheiv »wn Rife.
Whilst
A V I S I d N. 355
Wri I ffs'T there was Such Toiling and Sweating to aScend the Hill, I perceived a little By-Path, unSeen by any but mySelf, ill-which I Walked up very eafily. I afked the Guide the Meaning of this 5 when, Iddking at nie vary earnestly, he told me, thit he Saw I WaS but a Spedator, and cahSC'with thenii only’ frotn Guriofity, and not'frdm ahy Iricliiiation to Wealth therefore his Tickets could not blind my Eyes, but I must have Liberty to explore all their Paths, and See Things as they really Wdre.
T H E Manner of matching of the whole Company was very particular; for, as the Path was narrow, they costld not go many a-breast, but extended a great length; and, instead of walking on as fast as they could, every third Step they kicked one Foot backward, to keep any other from coming near thetri; nor did any Tye of Nature or Obligation prevent their adting in this manner: Fathers kicked against Sons, and Brothers against Brothers; and whoever Z 2	went
356 A V I S I O N.
went one Step cut of the Path, Scarcely ever found his way back again into it.
Several pleafant Walks and Seats were to be feen at a Small distance, which now and then allured Some of our Company from us, quite worn out with the long March, and not able to Sustain the Fatigue any longer. This happened very Seldom, notwithstauding, except mySelf, they were all barefoot, and the Ground was fo stoney, and fo strowed with Thorns and Briars, that every Step must give Pain unutterable: however, the longer they journeyed, the eafier became the Way. At last the Guide cryed out; ‘‘ We are now come very near the Palace of Wealthy ‘‘ for behold many of its Inhabitants.’’ There were Some few Men who looked rather half-starved, than like the Inhabitants of the Palace of Wealthy who came bowing and Scraping to our Company. The ReSpedl paid them by thefe poor half-starved Wretches, made them already forget the Pain of their Journey, and in theSe Submistjons they fancied they read their own great Riches: and indeed
thefe
A VISION. 357
theSe Men paid their ReSpeds according to the PerSon’s near Approach to the Palace, and greatly leffened them to thoSe, who were Sar behind.
I Began to be impatient, and ashed the Guide, how long it would be, before we should arrive: he laughed, and an-Swered; “Thewhole Company but your-“ Self think we are already arrived, for “ behold the Palace there before you; “ I give it the fpecious Name of the Pa-“ lace oI Wealth, to allure my Followers, “ and they are So blinded, that to them it “ looks like a Palace; but your Eyes being “ open, you fee plainly it is the Den of A‘variceI*
By this time we were arrived at the Gate, (which was one great Piece of Iron) that gave Entrance to this hideous Place: The way to open it, was hid to all but to our Guide Labour, who had a Key that unlocked it prefently. The Multitude croud-ed in with Such Haste and Impetuofity, to be foremost, that many, were trod to death in the Paffage. The In fide of this Z 3	imaginary
3s8 a V I S I O N.
imaginary Palace, and real Den, was frightful to behold; Horrof, Affright, and Anxiety met us at the Door; and, taking our Guide by the Hand, Said, they would lead us where we should meet our Reward. Many of us found great difficulty to follow ; for the Roof w&s So low, that we were obliged to go alimst double; at last we came to a little Room fb barricaded with Iron, that it looked like a PriSon. Here fat Avarice herfelf, but her Deformity was So very great, she did not care to appear to the Eyes, even of her Followers, but hid herfelf behind a large Stetue made of massy Gold. Care fat on a little Cushion piade of Nettles: on the one hand of her were Heaps of Bags of Gold, and on the other, Numbers of little Arrows So sharp at the Point, that their least Touch gave excessive Pain. Of thefe she had always a Supply from her own Bofom, So that they could never be exhausted.
All who had patiently born the Fatigue ©f the Journey, and could produce a Certificate under the Lady Pleafure's own Hand, that she had never in her life granted
A VISION. 359
jcd them any the least Favour, were to be rewarded in this manner: Care, by the Gomr mand of NwnVc, was to heap on their Backs Bags of Money, till they could Support, no more; and, notwithstanding to eyery Pag She fasten’d one of her Arrows in Such a manner, that it must pierce the PerSon, on whom the Bag was l^id, yet she was very Seldom bid to leave off. Some few indeed did go out of this Der, v/ith as many Bags as they could carry; but I was told, they were not the true Votaries to Avarice, only came that way (altho’ it was round about) in their Road to the Courts of Ambition, Pleafure, or Pride; to all which the shewing theSe Bags was a very good Pastport; but all the rest bore the sharp Pains cauSed by the Arrows, and the Burthen of the Gold, till Nature, at length worn out. Sunk upder the Load, and Death alone relieved them from that MiSery, which (poor deceived Wretches) they palled their Reward.
Immediately, on any one’s Departure out pf this Life, the next Heir appeared, and carried off as much of the Z 4	Money,
360
A VISION.
Money, as be possibly could, Setting out with full Speed, to Pleafure'i Courts where he must pay half his Wealth for his Admittance, and might Soon meet with Opportunities of fquandering away the other Part.
After I had feen feveral Instances of the fame kind, I grew tired with the Re-ssedlion on the painful Reward thefe poor Wretches met with, for thus patiently wading through all the Dirt, and bearing the Torture of all the Thorns they found in their way to this diSmal Place; and making what haste I could out of it, I hurried back to the Gates, where I presently mixed with a large Train, who were then just fetting out for Ambitiorfs Court.
The Guide to this was called Fallacy. and, at first fight, appeared both in Height and Bulk, like a Giant or GianteSs; for the odd Mixture of its DreSs made it utterly undistinguissrable, whether it was Male or Female; but, when Curiofity had led me near it, and I wanted to know from its own Mouth whither, and to what fort of
Palace
A VISION.
361
palace it was going to guide us, it Shrunk into a Shadow, and to my Sight the apparent Substapceimmediatly vanished. But still it had the Same Power of Speech, altho’ in a very weak Voice ; and told me, my Defire of knowing the real Truth, had given me power to See things as they were ; but that to all the rest of the Company it appeared, as it had at first fight to me; for that their great Defire of finding it to be real Substance, had Such an Effect on their Sight, as made them believe it was So : “ But, continued this Apparition.^ “ I am not obliged to tell more of myfelf “ than you can find out; therefore I will “ not anSwer another Question; but, when-“ ever you Speak, lest you should corrupt “ my Followers, I will order all the Drums, Kettle-Drums, and Trumpets to strike ‘‘ up, and try if Noife cannot drown your “ Voice.’*
This Road was much pleaSanter than that which led to Avarice, and we should have gone a great deal faster, but that the whole Proceshon went fide-ways, each Individual fixing one Eye on the Guide, lest
he
362 A V I S I D R
he Should lofe his Way; and the other, on the PerSon next behind him, at the Same time holding a Sword at Arm’s length, that his next Neighbour might not come near him. I observed in the Face of each Per-fon a vifible DiScontent, at not being able to put by this Sword. Here and there indeed, a Perfon of very remarkable Activity leaped over the Sword, and the Bearer of it; When this happened, the Perfon So jumped over. Set up a Huzza, which was echoed by all behind him, till they were all hoarSc, and had no Voice left. TheSe Oyteries Served to no manner of purpofe; for the envied Man would not come back again, but triumphed in the Thought that he was got foremost.
In this manner we marched till wc came to the Palace. The Gates flew open at the Touch of our Guide; and I found no Welcome was thought too great for this unsubstantial Being; this Creature’s Prefence being neceffary to keep the Court of Ambition from falling into the utmost Stupidity. The Moment it came near the L’hronCy it made a long Speech, to prove that HappineSs was only to be met with in
that
A V I S I G R 3%
|hat Court. That Alexander the Great was a very great Man ,j and IS he had lived still that time, might poffibly, if no Accident had intervened, been Master of the World. That yuIius Cnefar might have been long Emperor of the Romans^ if he had not been murdered, Wc. &c.. Then the Wretch ran out into a tedious Defcant on the Hor-rpr of Murder^ except when done to ferve the Qreeit Princefs Amhition; but Said, that Defign indeed made it laudable,. The Speech ended, Applaufes refounded through the Palace; and evCTy one fancied that he re-iembled fome of the Heroes therein mentioned. Ambition fat on her Phrone, which every Art had conSpired to adorn, cloathed in Robes made So heavy with Lace and jewels, that they Seemed Sufficient to weigli her down; but when stie roSe and Spoke, she made a NoiSe not unlike the blustering of the Northern Winds, or the roaring of the foaming Sea. Her Arms were stretched beyond their natural Length, by continual Endeavours to reach at the Clouds; and her Eye-Strings were almost cracked, by being turned for ever upwards. Sometimes the vast Crouds of her Attendants, and the various Ceremonies she Submitted to.
364 A VISION.
in being always in public, almost tired Ambition herSelf, and gave her a moment’s time for Reflection. But whenever that happened, a young Man clad in Robes of Gold advanced, and prefented her a Schedule, which contained thefe Words: “ My “ great and dread ^een, foie Sovereign of innumerable Subjects, Commander of “ Armies, Director of Sciences ; may your ‘‘ Slave prefume to remind you, that the Property of this Palace, which is the Admiration of the gazing Multitude, and “ the Imitation of the greatest Artists in Painting, Sculpture, Architecture,
“ &c. is yours, and yours alone.’’
Ambition, at thefe Words, Smiled Applaufe, and thought the Fatigue of Ceremonies, with all the Farce and Pomp of Show, too Small a Tax to pay for Such great and immenfe Advantages. Her Followers who had travelled long enough to reach the Palace, were thus rewarded. Fallacy blew a Trumpet; Drums, Kettle-Drums, all forts of the loudest martial Mustek immediately strike up. A Phantom, called Fame^ got up to the very Roof of the Palace,
A V I S I O N. 365
lace, and there fastened a Ladder of Ropes, as it appeared to me, (but to the rest a broad Stair-CaSe, every Step being, in their Eyes, covered with Velvet, and adorned with Diamonds) which was let down tp the Ground, and Ambition's Followers alj eagerly pushed forwards to climb it. At the first Step there was Such a Confufion and Bustling, as made it difficult for any one to aScend : But the happy Perfon who gained that, marched onward, whilst the rest followed him one by one, still diSputing the first PaSs. It was remarkable, that every one catched hold of one of the Legs of the PerSon that was next before him, apd endeavoured with all his Force to throw him off the Ladder. This Sometimes Succeeded; and Sometimes in the violent Tug to pull another down, a Man So shook himSelf, that unable to recover and poize himSelf again, he was forced to accompany the PerSon So pulled down in his Fall. To me they all Seemed to labour and Sweat every Step ; but I was told, that fixing their Eyes on the Fantom on the Top, they forgot, or rather were inSenSible of their Pain. On the Right-Hand of Fame fat Self-Conceit^
who
366 A VISION.
who" iVas not Seen to go up, but was born\ on Wings, and privately Seated there, before any of ther Company Saw her. She held in her Hand a Eooldhg-GlaSs, which had the Power of magnifying to shch a degree, that all who got high enough to lOok into it, thought themfeives ten times as big as they were before: When the Ladder was full, as it was of a prodigious Length, (even froni the bottom to the top of Anr-^ Mtion's Palace) It really waS a very odd Picture to See Such Numbers of People, (for the greatest Part ,gf Mankind appearecl tb be there) hanging on one another’s Legs, The happy Man wjio got first, as Soon as he could xt2ich. Fame, and fee himSelf irt the GlaSs of Self-Conceit, for a few Mb-^ ments fat down contented, contemplating his own Greatnefs. But whoever was next^ being enraged at the Distance; which all were obliged to keep from him, who had once gained theSummk of the Ladder, called Bw'iy from his Bofom, and Sent her Secretly to fasten a String to the Robes of this fup-poSed happy PerSon, whom he stigmatized by every vile Appellation imaginable. En-V/, as Soon as She had done what fhe vras
com-
A V I S I O N. 36y
commanded, rafi down the Ladder letting out the String every Step, and made each Marx forego his preSent Hold, and take this String in his Hand. As Soon as fh'e was at the bottom, the whole Company at Once gave Such a tug, as staggered the Man looking in the Glafs in his Seat. It is true, they had Several Pulls, before they could get him down; but from the time he felt himfelf thus tottering. Fear and Anxiety poffested him, and all his Happi-nefa was gone. Befides, by endeavouring to keep his Eyes fixed on the Glafs whilst he was So often Shaken, his Head turned quite giddy, and he Was diSabled from taking the proper Methods for his oWn Referva-tion. At last, by one violent Effort, he was thrown from this mucrh fbught-fbr Seat to the very bottom, where a Gulph presently opened, and fwalibwed him; and as his Place was immediately Supplied, he lest no more Traces of him behind, than an Eagle does in the Air through which she has flown.
IT was very odd to me, that no Man, when he came near tWs Seat, reflected on
the
368 A V I S I O N.
the Fate of thoSe who went before him; but thought his own Strength would infallibly Secure him from falling. When I had observed many Instances of the fame kind, I concluded, that if I was to stay there for Ages, I should fee no Alteration in the Management of Ambition's Palace; and therefore made the best of my way back again, and mixed with thoSe who were hastening to the Court of PleaSure.
This Road was So very broad, that we had two Guides, lest any of the Company should miSs their way. One was in the shape of a young Woman, curled, adorned, and painted in Such a manner^ that she appeared exceeding handSome. She walked all the way backward; for behind she was as deformed as her Face was beautiful. Her Name was Illufion. The other was a little Boy like Cupid, only he was not blind; and instead of a Bow and Arrow, carried a Shield, on which was inscribed the Names of every PleaSure pursued by Mankind. This he had an Art of turning So, as to shew to each Pastenger the Name of his Favourite PleaSure. He was 3	called
A V I S I O N. 369
called Hope. We travelled very fast. In the way was a well-built convenient Castle, pleaSantly fituated, and oit the Door was written, Here is Amufement for whoever thinks proper to come in.
We were met at our first Entrance by a middle-aged Woman; who informed us her Name was Eafe. Her Behaviour was com-poSed and chearful, arid her DreSs decent and becoming, without the least appearance of Ostentation. She shewed us the whole Cafle ; and in every Room was a Set of Company, employing themSelves as best Suited their Taste and Fancy. For my part, I had a great mind to stay here; for the whole Train was invited So to do, (and indeed I thought they would have done wifely in accepting the Invitation. But this was not the Defign of our two Guides, //-lufion and Hope., who entered into conSul-tation to prevent the Number of their Followers being lestened. To every Man who had a mind to lead a married Life, Eafe offered an agreeable modest Wife, and to
VoL. II.	A a	each
370 A VISION.
each Woman who choSe to enter into that State, an honest good Hushand.
Then came Hope^ and turned his Shield to the Gentlemen, • Where was inScribed a Woman all PerfeBion. And to the Ladies appeared this charming Sentence, A Hit/--band fo violently in love., that he Jhall tranf-form you into a Goddefs. To thoSe who choSe a fingle LiSe, Eafe offered a good ColleBion of Books, agreeable Companions, and ^Tranquillity; but Hope immediately shewed them public Diverfion, and an eternal Round of giddy Pleasures, to keep the animal Spirits .in a perpetual stutter. ThoSe whoSe Delight was placed chiesty in Conversation, Eafe shewed into a Room, where they might meet with Men of Parts to converSe with, almost whenever they pleaSed, in moderate Hours. Tl i. was overcome by the Appearance on the Shield oS Mirth at Midnight. It would be endleSs to enumerate the Particulars oS this whole Struggle, it is Sufficient that our Guides got th« better; and our Company was greatly increased, instead of being diminished. For 3	when
A VISION. 371
when we left the CaJUe, many who lived with Eafe^ and had been contented with AmuSements a great while, were glad of the Opportunity of following Hope^ and his Comrade Illufion.
At the Entrance of the Palace, one of our Guides, namely Hope, left us; and in his stead Certainty with a Smiling Countenance led us into a Spacious Hall, where the .whole Company appeared to be in Raptures, every married Woman found an Adorer in her Hushand; and every married Man thought his Wife all Perfection, continually whifpering in her Ears, Tcu are a Goddefs. Some of the Unmarried were led by Illufion into Such various Diverfions, that they had not time to be troubled with thinking one Moment. Others were converfing with the very Companions they choSe, and Hap-pincSs was displayed in their Countenances. In short, nothing but the Face of Joy wa? to be Seen.
I Began to think, this was indeed the right Road to take; when on a fstdderi t h.2L z	looked
372 AVI S I O N.
looked up, and beheld at one Corner of the Room Pleafure herSelf pouring Some Liquid of her own compofing into a great Sowl; which I fancied would be a great while a filling; but to my Amazement, in a very Small Space of time, it was full to the top ; and the moment a Drop ran over, ihe whole Scene was changed, and Tawmngs were the only Sounds to be heard. She was invifible to all the Company but myfelf; for they were too much taken up by their own Enjoyments, to mind what fhe was about; otherwise they would have stopped her Hand, before fhe overfilled the BowL Now as Soon as the Pawning was heard, Illujion opened a Door into another Apartment, to rouzc her Followers from this Stupidity. Here was the oddest Medley of Confufion imaginable. The new-made God-dejjh fell into Such Freaks and Vagaries, that they all appeared mad. One moment they gave their Worshippers Laws, the next recalled them ; then were angry they wero not obeyed; then frowned, and bewailed their Misfortunes; that others could not find out what they liad a mshd to have,
though
A V I S I O N. 373
though they were ignorant of it theniT Selves.
Their Adorers^ otherwiSe called Hufr bands, restleSs to pleaSe, them, yet finding it impossible, alternately grew outrageous, and fell into the most abjedl Submissions; then Succeeded Jealoufies, Quarrels, with the whole Train of domestick Ills.
Those who in the next Room were engaged in chearful Conversation, mistook here roaring NoiSe. for Mirth, and clamorous Arguments for ReaSon and PhiloSophy. And instead of converfing with one another to receive either Instrudlion or PleaSure, the End of their meeting Seemed to be nothing more or leSs, than to diSpleaSe, confound, and stun one another.
Here every thing which we call Di-verfion was lost; for thofe who before Seemed pleaSed and Satisfied with what they enjoyed, now So eagerly graSped at So many kinds of PleaSure, that they turned themfelyes giddy with the Variety, and rendered ”	A a 3	thenv
374 A vision:
themSelves incapable of the Er^oymcnt of any.
HEtiE, the natural Appetite to be Supplied with neceSSary Food was perverted into Gluttony and Luxury, which brought their constant Attendants Satiety and DiS-eaSes.
Here DrunkenneSs prevailed; bringing, in the Bloom of Youth, trembling Nerves, and shaking Limbs. In short, the whole Scene was So full of MiSery, occafioned by Pleafure's exceffive Liberality, in over-filling the Bowl, that I believe the whole Company would have been heartily glad, if she had never begun to fill it.
At the very Roof of this Room, acroSs a Beam, Sat perched a little ugly Monster called Difapf ointment. From its nasty Claws descended numberleSs Wires, and at the end of each was fastened a Hook, which the Monster could command. So as to hitch it in the BoSom of whomever he pleaSed. When by this means he had, one. by one,
got
A VISION. 375
got into his Clutches the whole Company, he discovered himSelf by a ScornSul Laugh ; and tugged at once his Wires, to make thb Hook more tormenting to their BoSoms.
Eve RY one Saw him, and Pain made every one fenfible of his detested PreSence. Struck with Horror at the Sight, I could not help inquiring how long theSe miSerable Wretches were to Suffer thus. When //-lujion (who was now at leiSure, having given up her Charge to the real Deity of the Place, called Difappointment) informed me, they might all be free, whenever they would con Sent to be touched by a Wand, which would immediately make them See the Impossibility of staying in the great Hall, where Pleafure prefides. But, continued She, “ Many will Sooner bear this “ miserable Situation for a great while, than “ conSent to Such Terms: And Sometimes, “ after they have conSented to this Condi-“ tion, and have been freed from this dread-“ ful Punishment, they return here again “ with the first Opportunity: But then we “ diSmiSs them on their Request. For we A a 4	are
376 A V I S I O N.
are very Sure that People So blinded will ‘‘ never eScape our Clutches for any long
time 5 and then the Punishment is dou^i. “ bled, by Refledfion on their own Folly.’* I was So uneaSy at this diSmal Spedlacle, that I fled from it, and was refolved to indulge my Curiofity to the full, and go next to the Palace of Pride.
The Name of the Guide to this Splendid Palace was Virtue. She was in appearance So tall, that her Head Seemed to reach the Clouds; whilst the Foldings, and Length of her Robe, hid her Feet from View. Jler Arms were numberleSs, and even to ine, at first Sight, appeared of Bulk and Strength equal to the Talk of Supporting her Followers. The Moment she found I was only a Paffenger, and not one of her Goddefs’s true Votaries, she lost the Power pf deceiving me, and shrunk in my View into a Dwarf; her Head tottered with its own Weight, her Anns dwindled into Shadows ; and I could plainly read in Small Tetters on her Breast, iS/y Nidme Ls De-fipfion %	to all her real Followers,
the
A V I S I O N. 377
the first Appearance still continued, and they rode on thefe Shadows with as much EaSe as if they had been flying through the Air. This Guide did not Suffer thoSe of her Train to walk, but carried them in her Arms, carefling and embracing them all the way. Through many a Labyrinth she went, through many a dirty Path she laboured. She had not always the Power of keeping thofe she attempted to Support, from touching the Ground; but ^s by her Endearments she had the Art of making them lofe all uneafy SenSations, she feemed well fatisfied in the ConSciouSneSs of her deceiving others ; and therefore thought no Pain too much, for thus gratifying she only Bent of her Nature. The Palace itSelf was not fo magnificent as I expedited; it was indeed greatly ornamented; but the Structure did not equal what my Imagination had formed ; and I was told Pride had iiiany other Ways of gratifying her Votaries, befides that of Sumptuous Palaces and magnificent Appearances. The Gates flew open at our Guide’s first Touch; and we were led through a great Number gf Apart-.............................. ments.

At first fight I was confounded with the Multitude of Objects which preSented them-felves to my View 3 but my Guide, who to me only was obliged to fpeak Truth, informed me, that the GoddeSs’s Father, and her own Offspring, numerous as this Af-fembly did appear, made up the whole of it; and then by Force (for it was Torture to her to let any Perfon into the Mysteries of the Place) fhe went on in the following manner:

Bloom of Youth : And we have a Prophecy amongst us, that So stie shall remain whilst this World lash. But her CaSe is very peculiar, in that no time can come, when her Father will be releaSed from his Care: for the moment he ceaSes to Support her Head with his mighty Arm, all her Dignity (I shudder at the Thought) must vanish, and the GoddeSs herSelf fink into noshing. All her Progeny you, who come only as a Spedlator, See plainly are fastened to her Girdle ' wish Cords as big as Cable-Ropes; but
■	to thoSe who come here as Worshippers • of the Goddefs, the Ropes are in vifible, and
■	the Connexion between the Mother and her Children is not feen; So that, blinded

But “ you may See Pride holding in her Hand her favourite Daughter Envy, who of all her Children has been the most fruit-ful. For from an incestuous Amour “ with her Grandfather Folly, she gave “ birth to Malignity, Spiteful Criticifm, “ falfe Ridicule, and all that numerous “ Race of Beings, whoSe whole Delight “ is in pulling others down. From her “ own shinny Breast, where is a conti-“ nual Source of Venom, do all her Off-“ Spring take their Nourilliment; and not-“ withstanding they delight to bite their “ Mother, yet fuch is her Fondnefs for “ them, that she never throws them from “ her Arms; but continues to embrace and “ feed them, without any Intermishon ; “ Seeming pleafed with the Pain they give “ her.

multiply daily. The monstrous Pro-dudfions they bring Sorth are difficult to describe. They Seldom come to Maturity, and are oSten So heavy and unanimated, that one can hardly Say they live
■	at all. Their Skin is as hard as Leather,
' and their Limbs distorted into various Folds = and Sizes, which are called Folid.Sy ^ar--

They are Spread all over with black Spots, in colour not unlike Ink. TheSe little ugly Monsters, from the time they are born, do nothing but quarrel and fight, which has the most Beauty; and their Claims are Supported by their re-SpedUve Parents, who take great care of them, and endeavour by all means poS-‘ Sible to keep them alive : But it is all ■ to no purpoSe; for the Space of four-' and-twenty Hours generally puts an end ' to them, and they are never heard of ‘ afterwards. Some of Envy's Offspring ‘ indeed are barren, and do not breed at ‘ all; and thofe who arc So, Spend their

“ That horrible Figure on the left ‘ Hand of Pritie, is call’d Ill-natureand, ‘ altho’ she never stirs from her Mother’s ‘ Side, yet it is not publicly known ‘ whofe Daughter she is; nay, she herfelf ‘ Sometimes diSowns her Parentage, and ‘ inlists upon it, that she made herfelf;
‘ but the Goddefs knows how to punish ‘ Such Ingratitude, and will not let her ■ have one Votary, till she has afked par-' don, and acknowledged her DeScent:
^ then she has the Power of exerting her-• lelf as much as she pleafes; and it is amazing how many Inventions she con-^ trives, to rack and toiture the Minds of others.
“ Perhaps you may be Surprized to See here many Beings, of whofe Existence

you must be certain, and yet know not, that Pride, bom of great Folly, was the “ Original of them all. Here Cruelty zxA “ Fyranny take up their Habitation, nay, “ even Luxury often worships our God-. “ deSs, tho’ her Birth is dubious, and she “ pays her Court alternatively here, and to “ the Goddefs of Pleafuref* I replied, that she judged right, for that I did indeed fee many Perfons there, of whoSe DeScent I had been hitherto doubtful. I begged her to tell me in what manner Pride rewarded her Followers; she told me, she could not stay any longer with me, for she was called upon to afiist in that Ceremony, which could not be performed without her; but* if I would observe her narrowly, I should be able to Satisfy my own Curiofity. In Saying this, she left me, and advancing immediately to the Throne, threw herSelf at Pride's Footstool.
Pride raiSed and embraced her. Saying; My Dear Deception, I must confefs you perform your Duty, in bringing me and my Offspring thoSe Worshippers, we So justly merit; and, if it was not for my

DECEPTION bowed low, and Seemed greatly rejoiced at her Command ; fhe then went round to every Inhabitant of the Palace, who each of them gave her a little Picture, thro’ the Middle of which ! She made a Hole with a Small Screw, (of which She was provided with greatNumbers) and left the Screw in it. The moment my Fellow-Travellers Saw this done, they all began to beckon, and call to her at once. She Went to them as fast as possible one after another; they caressed her at first with great Joy, but by their distorted Countenances, I vifibly perceived, She contrived Some Method of putting them to great pain.
W H £ N the Ceremony was over, I called to her, and begged an Explanation of what I had Seen. She frowned, and expressed much Ill-Humour, at being ob-I	liged

liged to gratiSy me, and then began, by Saying ; ‘‘ I thought your own penetrating “ Eyes would have unravelled the Mysteries of this Place; but fince L find it is other-“ wiSe, and it is my unhappy Lot to re-“ veal them unto you, know that all “ thoSe Pitstures, through which you Saw ‘‘ me put the Screws, are hieroglyphical “ Representations of Some Virtue or Fa-“ culty of the Mind: for example, that given me by Infolence, is a RepreSen-“ tation of Greatnefs of Mind; that by “ fpiteful Criticifm, of Learning and Un-^ ‘‘ derjianding‘y that by Jalfe Ridicule, of “ true Wit; that by Ill-Nature, of JuJlice', “ that by Envy, of Penetration-, and So “ all the rest, I have the Power of Screw-“ ing into the BoSoms of all who love and “ careSs me, that Pidlure, of which they “ make choice. This puts them to great “ pain, but yet they are So eager to have “ it done, that they Suffer it very patiently. “ Sometimes, when I meet with any Small Seed of that Virtue or Faculty of the “ Mind, which my Pidlure only falSly re-“ preSents, I am at great trouble to root it “ out ; but then the Refledion, how much VoL.

“ I impoSe on theSe Fools, (who by culti-“ vating and improving this Seed, might ‘‘ really poffeSs what they Suffer So much “ only to fancy they poffeSs) doubly ovcr-“ pays my Labour, and I am ready to burst my Sides with laughing. The moment I have Screwed my Picture into “ the BoSom of my GoddeSs’s Worshippers; “ they have a Power of turning their Eyes “ inward, and looking at it for the rest of their Lives. In this, and in endeavouring “ to prove to others that this RepreSenta-tion is Reality, they Spend their time, “ and grow very fond of all thoSe who ei-ther do believe them, or tell them they “ do; but thofe who are too faithful tOi “ try to impoSe on them, and would be “ glad to take from their BoSoms this pain-‘‘ ful Screw, and in its stead place there “ what is truly valuable, they hate and “ never forgive. This is the CauSe of a “ very great part of the Difcord and Con-tention in the World. But whenever “ two People meet, who have the Same Representations in their BoSoms, they are then apparent Friends, though generally
“ Secret

Secret Enemies. I have no power to do this to any but thoSe who voluntarily careSs me; and, with the Exception only " of Some few Perfons whom Curiofity draws hither, all who enter this Place are fond of me.”
Here She ceafed : I stood a Small time astonished at what She had told me; and then defired her only to inform me of one thing more, namely, whether Pride never rewarded her Followers with fine Equipage, Grandeur, Finery, &c. My Guide Smiled, and Said that was the common Question of the Curious. But, continued She, “ My GoddeSs Scorns to give Such Rewards, her Votaries are often Seen in Rags : But Vanity^ who is So distant a Relation of “ hers that she will hardly deign to own ^ her, keeps her Court not a great way ‘‘off; whither if you will go, you may “ fee what by Mistake you imagined was “ to be found here.”

encumbered with Ribbands^ Fringes^ Gold and Silver Lace., and all Sorts oS Finery, that my Feet were entangled every Step I took; and the prancing HorSes which drew after them gilt Coaches and Chariots, were like every Moment to have run over me ; So that it wa.s So tireSome, I left it, and turned up another Path, and endeavoured to find my way back again to the Gates, very melancholy that I had found no Palace where I could wiSh to stay : but I had now no Guide, and was bewildered in my own Thoughts; when turning my Eyes on my Right-Hand, I Saw, in a narrow winding Lane, a Small Party that Seemed to walk chearfully on, notwithstanding any Difficulties they encountered in the Road. Curiofity led me to join them ; and as Soon as I came within their reach, the hindmost held out a friendly Hand to help me on; for here, quite contrary to all the other Companies I have defcribed, every one helped his next Neighbour as much as lay in his power, which Softned the RoughneSs of the Way, and made the most rugged Paths Seem eafy to us. Our Guide’s Name
was

Was Patience \ anli hei* continual Smiles and merry Countenance gladdened our. Hearts, and made us forget every diSagree-, able thing in our PalTage. Just as we were getting out of this intricate Path, and faw before us the most beautiful Profped: imaginable; at-the very opening of the Gate that led to this charming Scene, were Avarice,^ Ambition., Pride, and Pleafure; in short, all the Deities at whofe Palaces we had already been, were affembled, in order to prevent our entering it, and by the Arts they uSed, they greatly leffened our Train. But we the few refolute who overcame them, the Moment we had forced our way through, were delivered by Patience over to Pruth, who condutsted us on to the Palace ctf Benevolence. Under the Direct ion of Such a Guide, we Seemed to fly rather than walk j the Profpect enlarged, and the Road grew broader every Step we went. When we arrived, at the Command of dur Guide all the Gates flew open; and the Countenance of all the Inhabitants was enough to infuSe Joy and GladneSs into the most infenfible Hearts. The Goddefs of
the

the Place, who is called Benevoleiptt, or real LovCy makes it her whole Study hourly to enhance the PleaSure of her Followers. On her Right-Hand fits foft Compajjion^ ever studying the Good of her Objedts; and on her Left is placed gentle TIendernefsy with Eyes overflowing with Tears of Sorrow or of Joy; though in this happy Place the latter was most times the Cafe. In all the other Palaces I had heard of thefe two Beings, especially in that of Pride^ but till now never Saw any Signs of them. I had So often heard it diSputed whether they had any Existence at all, that I was overjoyed at the Sight of them. The very Words Malignity.^ Anger^ ^trifey Env)\ &c. were banished hence ; and what elfewhere would be called the Height of Friendship, here was but the common Behaviour of every Man to his Acquaintance; the Rule of their Lives was the GoSpel In short, here Christianity was really taught and really practised. Error and Infirmities even here crept in, but they Served only to promote the Humility and Penitence of the Offenders, and exert the Compaffion and Good-

Nature of all the rest. The Sentence, Lhey deferve no Pity becaufe it is their own Faulty however common it may be in the World, was never heard in this Place j on the contrary, Compassion was here heightened, in proportion, as the Grief of the Sufferer must be the greater. Here an innocent Inclination was always Sure to be gratified ; becauSe the very hinting Such an Inclination was ReaSon enough for whoever heard it, to endeavour to fulfil it without any whfs or wherefore's. If it would but stand the Test of being innocent, all farther Examination ceaSed. Here all common AmuSements were heightened into PleaSures, by being participated with others; and the Modera* tion with which they were enjoyed, prevented any ill Confequence from attending them. Here every relative Duty, Such as that from Parents to Children, and that from Children to Parents, ^c. were So exactly performed, that no Complaints of heart-breaking Torments from the ill Ufage of others were ever heard; nor was that fort of Melancholy to be Seen on any Countenance, that indicates a Mind tormented

mented by tender GrieS. Here every Seed of real unaffed:ed Virtue was cultivated and improved; and, consequently, all the real HappineSs Hunaan Nature is capable of, was here enjoyed, and doubled by the Hope^ of yet greater.
I Was So pleafed with this Scene, that I wished never to lofe the View of it; but alas! I awoke, and ^11 the Vifion vanished, from my Eyes.
