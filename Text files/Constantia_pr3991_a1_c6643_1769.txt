TheSe very people would be greatly Surprised, should it be proved to them, beyond the power oS contra-di<stion,that the boasted histories they have continually in their hands, and So much admire, are Sor the most part but rough compilations of dates and SuppoSed events, which have all the ficstion of a romance without being So interesting, or Supported with equal grace, style, or probabi!ity: the existence of Their Semiramis, Romulus, and Cyrus is as difficult to prove as that of thoSe heroes who are stiled children of the imagination.
As for my parr, it was always my opinion that topreServe and multiply fiction which may be of any advantage to us, by interesting the heart, or amuSing the mind, far from re-

striding or destroying them, is ad-ing most agreeably to reaSon. True philoSophy is the art of knowing how to be happy. A child may be justly angry at his master, who, often lest reasonable than himSelS, tears his toys from him, and loads him with
wearisome tashs.
The Athenian
madman, who believed all the ships that entered the Piraeum, really belonged to him, cannot be blamed for refufing to pay the phySicians, who destroyed his happineSs by restoring his reaSon.
The vain clamours of a gloomy fadion will not prevail over the general fenSe of mankind. Romances have gained too great a credit in Society to fear the attacks of a few ob-fcure pedants. Certainly Marivaux, Richardfon, and Rousseau are preferable to a herd of commentators,

We shall not Speak here oS the pleasures that ariSe from a well invented fidlion ; let us only attend to the advantage theSe rigid readers themSelves may reap from thence. A good romance is as capable to cor-redt the mind as many a Sermon, or the most metaphysteal moral trea-tiSe; Sor we can never reclaim men Srom their errors but by a just repre.> Sentation of .them.

There is a great rcSemblance betwixt men’s minds and their constitutions ; Some kinds of food are too strong for their digestion, it is often fo with their mind : any thing Solid and learned is above their Capacity, and occafiona wearineSs and diSgysh We must therefore humour their weakneSs, treat them as under a regimen for their health, and under the charms of arniifement instil virtuous truths into their fouls.

What benefit do we reap from reading Such books ? They burden the memory, and overwhelm the mind with chronology, epochas^ fads, a Sew particular customs, and that is all: not the least reflexion Sor improving our reaSon.

preaching Such objedls, we rather depart from them as Sar as we are able; or if we go in quest of them, it is only to behold them in a miraculous light. They Seem new beings to us, Colossus’s raiSed on the tops of mountains: they strike the eyes, and Seed our stupid curiofity; but we are far from drawing a parallel between them and us, who look upon ourSelves as pigmies compared to them, and as a race of men of a different nature. Thus we never enter into that Spirit of combination, which SuppoSes a reSemblance betwixt their adions and ours, and equalling us with them, makes us of con Sequence only look upon them as models Sor us.
The nature of a romance is very different; it reprefcnts man as he really is, his virtues, his vices; it is
ON ROMANCES, xiii
a natural pidlure of Society within the reach of every one’s understanding; every reader may taste the pleasure of discovering his own like-neSs in it, and thereby amuSe and instrudt himSelf at the Same time
much better than in dreaming over all the historical books in the uni-verSe.
We cannot take too much pains to become acquainted with our own depth, nor apply too clofely to know what truly belongs to our nature. In a word, above all things we must avoid going out of our own Sphere,
if we deSire to follow the dictates of reaSon. History is more likely to
Spoil one’s mind, and to give it a
romantic turn than romance itlelf:
for what do we mean by rom.antic.?
Something marvellous without being
probable, strained attitudes, gigantic

figures, which is just what history preSents to readers oS an ordinary capacity; but we ought to make uSe oS a SaithSul mirror, and not trust to a glaSs that magnifies our appearance
to an enormous fize.
To all theSe advantages which romance has over history, let me yet add one which alone is Sufficient to cast the ballance on the Side of the Sor-mer. One essential rule oS romance is to shew vice punished always in Some degree on this Side oS eternity: but what do we find in history ? WickedneSs almost always triumphant, and innocence oppressed; usurpers happy, and lawSul princes dethroned; justice Sold for interest; friendship, love, and even nature it-Self Sacrificed to ambition: in a word, the weaker always made a prey to the stronger, is it thence we should colle(st the Seeds of morality? Do
we

-we there find examples to be Sol-lowed !*
Finally, romance is the book of humanity; it instils tenderneSs and ScnSibility into the Soul, the true principles of virtue; it Softens the haughtineSs of pride, inSpires compassion, brings us back to nature, and keeps it alive in our heart. Our Sentiments, like our bodies, are Subje<st to change and decay, and may be totally extinguished, if they are not attended to; and nothing can strengthen or Support them equal to romance.

tion to fituation as Srom Scene to Scene.
Enough has been Said to prove the advantages and Superiority of romance over history. The best defence no doubt would be to write one that would unite all the qualities we have here propoSed. Daily experience shews us people learned enough to reaSon on the means of making a perfect work, but few have Succeeded in the execution.

CONSTANTIA,

DAUGHTER JULIA
An ITALIAN HISTORY.
ONSTANTIA was born of
one oS the most illustrious families oS Italy; Rome has Seen among her ancestors, cardinals, zealous deSen-
ders of religion, and generals worthy of the first ages of the republic.
The marquis of Sp—a, the last of his name, had two Sons and a daughter.

ter. The one by his birth and a6li-vity had raiSed himSelS to the dignity of a cardinalj and looked upon the papal throne as the only step yet remaining to mount the Summit of earthly grandeur, to which, by his ambition and policy, he was paving his way. The other occupied a very honourable post in the army; and, leSs ambitious than his brother, contented himSelf with the station he was
in.
Constantia was no leSs indebted to nature than her brothers; her perfect beauty, accompanied with every mental accomplishment, rendered her the most charming and valuable per-Son of her Sex: tho’ mistreSs of every art to pleaSe, she was yet an entire stranger to the power of love. Happy ignorance! but the time was at hand, that the deity was to make his appearance, and exadt of Constantia

that tribute, which Sooner or later every heart is obliged to pay.
The marquis of Sp-------a had a-
mong his gentlemen one called Jaco-mo, a young Frenchman, whoSe true name was Sr. Val, whom an affair of honour had obliged to leave his na-
tiv'e country.
Grates or bars could not hinder love from entering into places that are otherwise impervious to the view. St. Val’s fame reached Constantia, and his charaOer was drawn in the most advantageous light imaginable; it was her chamber-maid that fi.*-st in-fuSed the Seducing poiSon into her breast. St. Val had Seen Constantia at a public entertainment; her beauty struck him; he Sound means to gain this maid over to his interest, who, on her part, omitted nothing to make him amiable inConstantia’seyes, She
watched the moments her mistreSs’s

But what oc* caSion is there to Seek pretences ? does not nature Surnish enough I Constan-tia heard at first the enchanting language with pleaSure, and then began to Speak it herSelS: happy Sor her,, had she remained in that Simple knowledge which teaches us to distinguish love Srom friendship.
RoSa,, which was the name of this intriguing, girl, thought fit to inform St. Val of the sstuation to which she had brought her mistreSs; he profited by the advice, and writ Constan-tia a letter, wherein he painted him-Self the most tender, faithful, and reS-pedtful lover.
ReSpecI stands Security for love at his first appearance; the fair Sex is leSs alarmed when a lover makes uSe of this veil to cover the violence and

boldneSs of his Sentiments: but is the urchin once received, he Soon shews himSelf in his true colours. ReSpe<fl grows troubleSomc; and tho^ reaSon takes his part, the heart Suggests a thousand motives to remove him; one heSitates a while to paSs Sentence, at length he is dismissed; love remains alone, he dares to wish, makes the attempt, is crowned with Suc-ceSs.
RoSa was charged to deliver the letter to the young marchioneSs; the SucceSs was doubtful: if Constantia had Some unguarded moments, hoW many others had she, in which her virtue took the alarm, and destroyed all RoSa’s hopes; honour in the light it appears to a lady, is not eaSy to be laid aSide; but if once put to flight, never returns again.
St. Val waited with impatience news of his enterprize, but received
none.
TheHISTORYof
none. RoSa at last Seized the lucky moment, when her mistreSs and she had been converSing about the young Frenchman; the expert confidant reads in Constantia’s eyes the tender motions that passed in her heart, Surprises her weakneSs, and preSents St. Val’s letter. Constantia storms at first, then Softens, heSitates iS she shall receive it or not, receives it at last, opens it with curioSity, and reads it with pleaSure.
We find our way to a woman’s heart only by degrees; we must climb at the first step, we walk at the Se-cond, we run at the third, and the fourth raiSes us to the Summit of our wishes.
The young marchioneSs shewed no leSs rcludfance to anSwer her lover. So that Rofa was obliged to renew the attack. Constantia aSter a great struggle took the pen in her hand; but an unlucky Scruple aroSe, and was ready
to
C O N S T A N T I A. 23
to destroy all RoSa’s labour. At length love got the better; St. Val received an anSwer as favourable as he could liave expedled. Constantia indeed did not difcover her real Sentiments in it, yet instead of the term, esteem, it was eaSy to read that of love,
A lover Sees with other eyes than an ordinary reader; the heart on theSe occaSions is more expert than the understanding.
St. Val having now got over this, had to conSider what step was next to be taken; to have written was not enough: he conSults RoSa in what manner to bring about an interview
with his mistreSs. They agree he
#
should go to the church Constantia uSed to frequent.
Constantia shut her eyes against every thing that oppoSed her passion; she was afraid she could not be tender enough; whatever looked like love,
had
24 The HISTORY of
had infinite charms Sor her, the least reste(5l:ion of virtue made her uneaSy; she appealed Srom reaSon to the heart; this judge never Sailed to give the cauSe in her Savour. RoSa cherished the voluntary distra(fIion Srom her duty; did Constantia call Sor a book, the fly girl was always Sure to preSent the page, where tales oS love were told; did theyconverSe on indifferent Subjedls, she artSully blended the diS-courSe with love; in a word, Constantia could no where turn her eyes, but the image of love was continually presented to her view.
The day came at last St. Val had wished Sor with So much eagerneSs, the only day on which an Italian lady can deceive a hushand’s or parent’s v/atchSul eye. Our amorous Frenchman did not Sail to hasten to the place appointed: he Saw the young marchioneSs, he adored her,
and
CONSTANT I A.

and Srom that instant vowed her eternal Saith. Her veil hindered her charms from appearing in their Sull lustre; yet not So but Some shone through, which like the Saint beams of the Sun through a cloud, indicated the bright radiance that blazed be-
O
hind.
Constantia was no leSs taken with her lover; St. Val made a very lively impression upon her heart, one can-not deScribe the diSorder of two lovers: Sometimes Constantia inv/ard!v repined at the manners of her country, and wished her lover could read what she felt for him, in her eyes; at others she thought herSelf much indebted to her veil, as it concealed from the observation of others what she only wished to diScover to St. Val: but her Sighs made ample a^ mends, the frequency of which told her lover how deeply he was rooted in her affedions.

Yet
26 The HISTORY of
Yet what her veil obliged her to hide, that she perceived with infinite SatisSaftion in her lover, whoSe looks continually turned -towards her, expressed a Soul all on fire. At length they retired quite enraptured with one another, tho’ they had not been able to declare tsseir paS-fion, which made Such a rapid progress.
This interview gave the finishing stroke to Cohstantia’s wavering virtue. She lost ail Seeling that she was in the wrong; weakneSs had grown into a lethargy; she only Saw reaSon at a distance, and her ssght was So weak, it had been better she had been quite blind.
The more a woman gives herSelf up to dispute,, the leSs Sure she is of vidory; she accustoms herSelf to be overcome; her defeat does not affrighten her, her passion becomes
ha-
C O N S T A N T I A. 2 7
habitual. The contrary happens to a heart that yields without allowing itSelf time to be Seduced ; it riSes again with the Same precipitation; it may Slumber in pleaSure, but will
never Sail quite afieep: a coquet triumphs in her very deSeat, but a prude has reaSon to fear even in het vidtory.
It was impossible Sor Constantia not to go Sarther than a Simple interview ; her duty Spoke as yet, but itg voice was So weak she could with difficusty hear it: that of love was stronger and more perSuafive. Alas, how shall we deSend the SortreSs, when the heart joins with nature to attack it!
St. Val has recourSe to RoSa, who had hitherto So Saithfully Seconded all his views. Constantia perhaps was no leSs dessrous than him oS a nearer acquaintance; but decorum.

that imperious tyrant of the Sex, obliged her to conceal her inclinations. Strange prejudice! is not nature the Same in every breast ? are the laws of humanity only established for us? should a woman’s heart be deprived of all feeling.
RoSa knew but two well that of her mistreSs to expoSe her to a confession

which the violence of her passion might have extorted from her; she would not reduce her to Such a humbling fitiiation.
A woman even in the height of her paffion for another, always preserves Something of iiSelf, which is the only prejudice we ought to reSpedt in the Sex. This is that chimera, which, tho’ often overcome, can never be totally rooted out: we call it honour, virtue, but it is Self-love transformed into theSe shapes; thus it becomes
a necessary ingredient in the compo-
sition
CONSTANTIA. 29
Sition oS a woman, and it is to this happy transformation we owe our vidtory over the fair Sex; we may cast down its power, but must alv/ays preServe its title, its outSide; the appearance of virtue is the real virtue of a woman. This principle of Self-love produces different effedls; a lover must know how to apply them all in their turns: an attempt will fail today, which may turn out extremely well to-morrow. A woman in Sacrifi-

St. Val engaged the maid to introduce him into her mistreSs’s apartment. The undertaking was bold; but interest having tied the knot, it was difficult to unlooSe it. RoSa thought her mistreSs would not be

altogether diSpleaSed ; nor was fire deceived. St. Val appears, throws liimSelSatConstantia’s Seet, and breaks out in the most lively, most tender expressions; he sheds tears, and vows fidelity which should not terminate hut with his latest breath: his looks, his fighs, made a part of the declaration, even his very Silence Spoke in favour of our young Frenchman.
How eaSily do we let ourSelves be perSuaded when we are in love; for how should we refist ? it is almost more than human not to be weak on theSe occaSions. Constantia at first Surprised then provoked at &. Vai’s temerity, was going to let him Seel the esteds of her just indignation, and turned her eyes towards him. This look Spoils all, love triumphs, tenderneSs takes place of reSentment, pleasure puts on a thouSand different shapes in Constantia’s breast: Sometimes
CONST ANT I A. 31
limes it is motionleSs, at others lively to exceSs, then calm and impetuous by turns.
Constantia wished she had loved St. Val with leSs ardour; but he was too amiable, she. too SenSible not to Sorgive his fault. Such a Situation is. not. eassly described ; it is
better felt than expressed.
A thousand times did the young marchioneSs in this interview give the name of esteem to the most violent passion. St. Val on his part op-poSed the term of reSpedl to the reproaches his mistrcSs’s Scruples drew upon him: she believed him, and he was overjoyed. Constantia thought him master of a virtue, it would have put him to defpair to have really poS-Seffed.
The next day our lover appeared again before his mistreSs; new reproaches on Constantia’s part opened
B 4
the
32
The HISTORY of
the Scene, yet it ended with greater regret on both fides than the time beSore.
The young marchioneSs was in the state oS a perSon, who is beginning to contract a Samiliarity with her passion; she thought she Saw nothing extraordinary in love; that it was most natural: then can there be any thing more charming than two hearts united together by the bonds of an ardent' affedlion, difintangled Srom the groSs Setters of SenSe? Nature has made us Sor one another; it is her has given birth to that Sympathy, the effedls pf which we feel, without discerning the cauSe. Love is the most glorious mark oS humanity; the greatest men are not ashamed of their weaknefs on theSe occaSions; why should reaSon forbid what nature commands.? ’This was precisely what Constantia Said to herSelf; theSe ideas
har-
CONSTANTIA.
33
hardened her against vulgar prejudices, love only Spoke, love only was heard.
St. Val Sor Several days Sollowing aded the Same part, which being thus continued became more and more interesting. Constantia at length confessed ingenuoussy she loved him; esteem Served no longer as a cloak to love; Sr. Val alSo bid reSpe(5l Sarewel. SenSe began to gain an •abfolute dominion over the Soul: Constantia shewed daily more and more complailance for herfelf; new
ideas lefs Spiritual than the former aroSe in her mind, representing that love was no crime, but a weakneSs eaSily to be pardoned; that a lover might be allowed certain liberties, when a lady reSolves. to preServe her virtue by guarding against ex-
treams.

Seemingly wrapt up in thought, feigned not to advert to. Thus St. Val Sound Constantia grew more and more eaSy in pardoning the Sreedoms he took: her passion increaSed, the phantom of honour disappeared, her eyes were overclouded, her voice dyed away on her lips, SenSe took place of

reste£lion, pleaSure thrilled thro’ every vein, her reaSon was wandering, and her heart acknowledged no other guide but love. St. Val, who ressedled even in his most enraptured moments, retired without making any Sarther attempt, perSuaded Such a retreat was
as good as a vicstory, which, Sor its
being delayed, would be no leSs glorious.
Some women must be as it were taken by storm, others do not^Sur-
render till after a number of little

conssi(sts, others recover their strength the very moment we think we have made their weakneSs ply to our wishes. Caprice is the Soul of all their a<5lions, the rule of all their virtues, pleasures, passions; Sometimes a moment well employed will do more in our Savour than m.onths, nay years, tendance.

At length the happy day reServed Sor St. Val’s vidlory arrived; he uSed a stratagem which never Sails: he af-Seded a coldneSs towards the lady, diScourSed of her charms with tranquility, and told her without transport that he loved her. Constantia was alarmed, she Seared Some change on the part of St. Val, and even dropt Some reproaches.
SelS-love proved stronger at that instant than even love itSelf, and it was to that St. Val owed his happi-neSs; oar expert lover, perceiving the good effect his dissimulation had produced, throws himSelf at his mistreSs’s feet, devours her hands with kisses; the marchioneSs made no reSistance, St. Val pnrSues his advantage, he flies, he triumphs. Constantia sheds a stood of tears, calls him a liundred times perfidious, and a traitor; St. Val anSwered nothing, but throwing his

The young marchioneSs did not yet know, that Sorrow follows cloSe at the heels oS theSe Sorbidden pleasures :. all her proSpedis were Sull of happineSs. Occupied with the preSenr, she did not See into Suturity; all her ideas, all her Sentiments, were drowned in a Sea of pleaSure.
Repentance at last Sound its way to her heart, conduced thither by love itSelf; she had too dear bought a few momentary joys. She had hitherto relied on fortune; the distance of the danger made it appear leSs; but when the Sourth month came to be run out, the unfortunate marchioneSs Saw lote without a veil; then he appeared as cruel and perfidiou to her as he before had Seemed tender and charming.

RoSa got all the ill uSage, love, the cauSe of all, deServed. Constantia jaid the Sault entirely upon her, which is generally the reward theSe confidants meet with.
It is Some comSort to a woman to make another perSon’s heart reSponSi-ble for the errors oS her own : she thinks herSelS leSs criminal, when another shares part oS her guilt. This is the effedl oS SclS-love, the common Soible oS the Sair Sex, or rather of human kind.

the young marchioneSs? yet what cannot we Surmount when, inipired by love ?
St. Val took advantage of the marquis’s abSence, who had retired Sor Some days to his houfe atFreScati: he invites the Servants that were left behind viith Constantia to a Supper, which they accepted; towards the end of their repast he mixed their w'ine with a liquor, which put them Soon into the condition the lovers wanted, who Seizing the opportunity,

leSt the houSe under covert oS the night, and, together with RoSa, Set out Sor Marseilles.
Constantia was blinded with love, which draws a number oS conSequen* ces aSter it no other passion does. It is very Seldom that a woman prescribes bounds to it; she hopes always to taste new pleaSures. The heart goes Sometimes more astray than the imagination; dessre leads it farther than pleasure can go, as this may be exhausted, but that grows stronger, and is daily renewed.
The journey proved very Satigue-ing to Constantia, and the loSing her maid made it yet more So, who, out oS Sear lest she should fall into the old marquis’s hands, had abandoned her mistreSs.
Constantia pasted for St. Val’s vyiSe, and was now only waiting the time to make theSe bonds lawSul which love had Sormed. They had already
entered

41
entered the borders of France, and were got as Sar as MarSeilles; but, alas! little did they know the misfortunes that were yet attending them.
The young marchioneSs fell dan-geroully Sick, occaSioned by the fatigue of the journey; to stay in an inn would have been expossng themSelves to the danger of being known, as they did not doubt but the marquis would every where cauSe diligent enquiry to be made, in order to find out the place of their retreat. Their finances alfo were on the decline, and every thing about them began to look gloomy: it was therefore necessary to think what to betake themSelves to in Such desperate circumstances, St. Val, after much consideration, broke the affair to Constantia; he propoSed to her, with a relu(5lance equal to his Sorrow, to go into one of thoSe houSes that are destined for the reception of

A confuSed storm of the most ex^ cruciating ressedtions, one more horrid than another, overpowered her: she called to mind her birth, the loSs oS her fortune, the injury done the whole family, her Sather’s anger,and the indignation of all her friends; but no Sooner did she cast her eyes again on St. Val, than all theSe terrible appearances vanished, he Seemed more lovely than ever, and provided she preServed his affedlion, she was quite indifferent to whatever might beSal herSelf. She hastened to her diSmal abode, condudled

Love was now transformed in Con-stantia’s boSom to a kind of virtue, as even Self-love was Sacrificed to it, which Sacrifice whenever a. woman makes, it renders her a thouSand times more virtuous than thoSe who are So by reaSon or rather through habit.
In this condition St. Va! viSited Constantia as oSten as the rules of the hoSpital would permit him to enter. Her pregnancy was not the only cauSe of her SickneSs: she had Sor Some days been Seized with a violent Sever, which increased'to Such a degree, that it was thought necessary to tell her the danger she was in; at last she was given over by the phyficians.

Says she to Sr. Val; heaven has punished me Sor my fault, if our love can be called So; it is but just I alone should Suffer, as I alone was guilty: all your misfortunes will end with my life; farewell! it is the last time you will See your unhappy Con-stantia, the last time I can tell you, I love you. I hoped to have left you a pledge of my tendernefs, this pidfure of our love would have been continually before your eyes, it would have remembered you of its unhappy mother, but as an addition to my miSe-ry, heaven deprives me of this means of eassng your grief.

The tears that run gushing down bis cheeks, choaked his voice; he looked at Constantia without being able to utter a word, his Sorrow became Silent, but how many things did their hearts Say to one another ! bow eloquent was their fi-lence!—CeaSe, replied Constantia, to make me apprehenSive oS death, take yourSelf away, leave me, forget me. What, I forget you! replies St. Val; is it you that is Speaking to me ? Constantia loves me, and commands me to forget her!

Constantia could not finish theSe words, a deadly paleneSs Spread over her countenance, she became Speech-leSs, her eyes alone remained the interpreters of her love, they ,were fixed on St. Val, she pressed his hand tenderly, while he watered her’s with his tears; at last her eyes alSo clofed.
What a diSmal Situation ! our Sentiments on theSe occastons labour Sor expression; our grief can find no vent, we only feel all the weight thereof, when it begins to SubSide. The mar-chioneSs appeared really dead to Sr. Val, and he himSelf was little leSs:

he remained motionleSs, the SurpriSe and violence of the stroke deprived him oS all power of complaint, the agony he Selt rendered him quite in-SenSible; the people oS the hoSpital came in, and, no lefs deceived than St. Val withConstanlia’s appearance, hurried him away from the fatal Spot, the condition he was in hindering him Srom attending to what they were doing, or to reSiiSe their assistance.
Yet this was not the end-of Con-stantia’s misfortunes; she had only Sallen into a Swoon, Srom which she recovered in Some hours. She no Sooner opened her eyes, but she looked round for St. Val, but in vain; his name was the first thing she could pronounce, but this unhappy lover was deaf to her complaints. How great was Constantia’s deSpair when
she missed him Srom her Side; she alks what is become of him, and

Death itSelf had not been So terriSying toConstantia; her lovers departure was like a thunderbolt to her: SurpriSe, Sorrow, rage, Seized her all at once. Cruel St. Val, cries she, you are gone, and have leSt me! you abandoned me at the approach oS death, and Said you loved me, can I believe you .? No, I shall never See
you more, I'shall never See an un-grateSul wretch, Sor whom I Sacrificed my Sortune, honour, liSe! no, St. Val,
I shall never See you more !
This idea alone threw Constantia into a new fainting fit; Sometimes she heaved a profound Sigh, at otliers she liSt up her eyes to heaven, bathed in tears; she loaded St. Val with re-

from a heart she had been So wholly mistreSs of.

Constantia rendered herSelS uSeSuI to her beneSadlreSs by a thouSand little Services, as she had it not in her power to give her more Solid prooSs of her gratitude; and thus a life of Ib much retirement rendered ineffectual all the Search her father made for her. Then it was her fault and misfortune began to Sit heavy upon her: her love was grown more Settled, and her heart ceaSed to be toS-Sed with thoSe Sudden gusts that deprive us of reaSon, and hurry us on to the.most cruel extremities; but this calm was accompanied with a

Constantia employed all the (pare time she had to the best advantage; she wrought at her needle, and earned as much as would have Sufficed to maintain herSelf and daughter.

The history of
Julia had already reached her Seventh year, but knew nothing of her birth, her mother waiting a more favourable opportunity to diScover the Source oS her misSortunes to her. Blanche had alSo a Son a little older than Julia. This young couple, brought up together, conceived a liking to one another; they began to Seel the power of nature in their tender breasts; all their inclinations were the Same, their greatest pleaSure was in being together.
Neither 0(5tavio, So Blanche’s Son was called, nor Julia, could have given a name to what they felt; but this ignorance was only a contradt-ed knowledge reaSon and maturity must unSoid: two young perSons take a fancy to one another, and though they cannot See the principle that urges them on, they no leSs willingly yield to the gentle attraction; nature

Constantia attributed this mutual inclination to the weakneSs of youth, and looked upon a passion that was daily gathering strength, in no other light than that of childish amuSe-ment. If Julia found herSelf a moment abSent from Oistavio, she grew melancholy, and whenever he appeared ‘again, the cloud vanished, Julia was now almost thirteen; her mother at length began to open her eyes with regard to a paS-sson she had hitherto unknowingly cherished. She did not allow Julia to be So oSten in Odavio’s company, and his mother laid him under the

How often did they inwardly repine at their parents orders! How oSten did they Search in themSelves Sor the reason of a prohibition So contrary to their happineSs! They did not yet know how dangerous it is blindly to follow nature.
At last Julia thought of an expedient to remedy the distreSs they laboured under; she reSolved to Write to her lover. Scarce indeed had she learnt to form a letter; but love is an able master, and needs but little time for instrudion, as the heart listens to his lessons with pleastire: he guided the pen of his young Scholar, and didated as follows:

I am at a loSs what to think oS mySelS; I feel a thouSand things I want words to expreSs. Love me as much as I do you. This word is the only expression I can find fit to convey my meaning: yes, Odtavio, 1 love you; believe my heart repeats it without interruption; read my letter Several times over, and take care
to conceal it.

Julia laid hold of an opportunity to flip this billet into Odtavio’s hand,

who run diredly into the wood that was behind the houSe. How charming did the contents appear to him! how did they affed him! he read the letter twenty times over, and always felt the Same deSire to read it again. He that could Scarce for a moment
t
look on a book, had his eyes constantly fixed on this bittle, and continually discovered Some new beauty to attrad his attention. How ex-

preffive did the words “ I love you,” Seem to him! how did he feel the strength thereof! He could not well conceal, his joy, and had the greatest difficulty to dissemble, as he would
willingly have communicated hishap-pineSs to the whole world.
We do not think ourSelves completely happy So long as others are ignorant of our felicity. Perhaps this Sentiment ariSes from the imper-fedion of our nature: we love to

When evening came, Odavio returned home; Supper being brought in, he placed himSelf next to Julia, the fight of whom put him into conSuSion: he passed with rapidity Srom the most profound refleiflion to the greatest vivacity: he gazed incessantly on Julia, and yet did not See her; the exceSs of his affedion hindered him from giving any outward Sign of the confufion he was in. His SenSes were in SuSpenSe; they Seemed abSorbed in a motion-ieSs tranquility, which ariSes from
the

the most violent agitation. ASter Supper he retired to his room more passionately in love than ever, and writ the following anSwer to his mistreSs,
How unhappy am I alSo, my

Remember, divine Julia, that you are all the hap-pineSs I wish for; that my life depends upon yours; and, lastly, that nothing shall ever part us. Be assured that this letter is only a Saint resemblance of my Sentiments, that my heart alone feels Such emotions a thousand others could not contain.

Odavio gave Julia this letter the next day in the Same manner he had received his. We need not enlarge on the Surprizes and rapture of his young mistreSs on reading theSe lines: let it Suffice to Say, that the pleafure they gave Julia, exceeded that oS her lover. Any thing of that kind always makes a deeper impression on a female mind, as the leSs liberty they have of shewing their Satisfaction outwardly the more intenSe it is within.
Our two young lovers kept up a mutual correspondence aSter this manner; and though their letters were nothing but repetitions oS the Same Subject, yet love every time inSpired them with different expressions, and lent them the graces of novelty. It is certain we never weary repeating any thing that relates to our Savourite passion; pleaSure shews

Blanche anshConstantia grew daily more and more watchSul with regard to the young folks; they were but very Seldom allowed to See one another;,, and Julia was obliged to keep her mother company- at her work, Blanche,., being able to give her Son a genteeS education, cauSed him to be instructed in the more necessary Sciences, without negleCting the polite accomplishments.
The day at last arrived on which love was to Surmount all the obstacles Blanche and Constantia could put in its way: they both went to town on Some very pressing occafion, and were consequently obliged to remit Something of their uSual precaution. The lovers did not let stip Such an opportunity to enjoy one another’s company. As

If you loved, divine Julia, to the exceSs I do, you would not tremble; fear proceeds from indifference.

Julia, on her part, gave herSelf up to the most lively transports. Odiavio pressed her to his breast, anst almost devoured her with his kisses. Young as they were and in Such a sstuation, tlie conSequences might have been Satal, had not the Sudden return of their 'mothers broke off the interview.
Fear brought Julia back to the life of her SenSes i she could not look

Here she began to ressedl: on the Scene between her and Ottavio-, she was ashamed of herSelf, and knew

not what to think oS the manner in which his preSence affedled her: his SondneSs Sor her excited very dister-ent SenSations Srom what she experienced when caressed by her mother: she therefore reSolved never to allow him an opportunity of raiSing Such tumults in her breast for the future. No, cries she, all in confuSion, no, Oistavio, 1 will never See you again ! I will no longer love you—what, I will no longer love you! is it in my power to hate you ,? by what magic have you thus changed my heart ? Since you difcovered your passion to me, I have never had a moment’s rest; every thing I See recalls you to my mind ; every thing I like, remembers me of you; you are the only objedt of all my wishes.

When once we begin to deliberate between love and reaSon, the last Seldom prevails; we imagine we shall eaSe our pain by applying remedies that only Serve to irritate it. Do we Sincerely delire to get the better of an inclination it is yet in our power to overcome, we must break off all conversation with our heart; diffidence of our own strength is the best means to preServe our liberty.

her narration, omitted thole parts of
her history that were leSs favourable to virtue ; she gave St. Val the name of hushand, a title which rendered her passion more excuSable, as that of lover would have ill Suited the lesson she was giving her daughter.
So then. Says Julia with a heavy figh, I must no longer love Odtavio! the Same day that gave me one blef-Sing, deprives me of another, the loSs of which abates the pleaSure of the first. Alas! I am undone. I am made a Sacrifice to my birth, a

The History oS BLANCHE.
IT is not necessary I should give you a detail of my misSortunes; I was born with them, yet should never have troubled you with a recital thereof, did not you alSo Seem to have had your own share of adverSity. You have certainly long Since remarked, that my preSent fortune and condition are but very moderate ; I live much below the rank I was born to. My mother lost her life in giving me birth ; my father was a Spanish no-, bleman possessed but of a Small estate, but his probity equaled his noble deScent, above Sortune, by his virtue, he deSpiSed both her Srowns and favours. I received an education Suitable to my birth; my father looked with reaSon upon that as the best inheritance he could leave me, not-

82 The HISTORY of
withstanding it is So much negleded at preSent. I had entered my Sixteenth year, which is generally the time we loSe our relish Sor childish amuSements, and Seek others no leSs vain but more dangerous, when a young gentleman whoSe name was Fabricio, Saw me at a public entertainment. Some charms nature had lent me, heightened by youth, rhade him one oS the fondest of lovers: he ashed me in marriage of my father. Though inferior in birth to me, he was possessed of a large fortune, with shining qualities; befides theSe advantages, Some of his relations occupied very distinguished posts, which opened the way to Savour. My father conSented without difficulty to this match; he only regarded my happineSs, and I found it in Fabricio.
I had forgot to tell you that my lover had a very formidable rival, Don JoSeph de Padillo, nephew to
the

the duke of Medina Celi, who pre^ tended he should yield to him. This nobleman of the first rarsh, of an engaging figure, and had often Signalized his courage; but theSe promising qualities were effaced by others of a different nature : she was haughty, ambitious, inSolent, and the higher he thought himfelf above others by his birth, the greater Scope he gave to his vicious inclinations. You may believe I did not hefitate a moment which to chuSe. From my infancy I had given my Self up to the guidance of reaSon, nor was I to be blinded by rank; I only Sought the man of honour in the gentleman, birth only Serves to lessen us, when not Supported by virtue: I therefore preferred Fabricio to his rival, and plighted him my faith.
But the day was come that had been referved for the greatest of miS-
for-
84 The HISTORY of
fortunes: we were going out of the church in which the marriage ceremony^ had been perSormed, when I cSpyed a stranger, who rushed im-petuoussy through the crowd, stew furiousty at my SpouSe with his Sword drawn, and pierced him in a thouSand places beSore my eyes; I immediately knew it was Don JoScph de Pa-dillo. The company that was with us purSued the murderer; my Sather, prompted by revenge, and more eager than the rest, came first up with Padillo; he had already lifted up his arm to give the deadly blow, when, alas! madam, he received it him-SelS.
You will eaSily imagine the ex-ceSs of Sorrow I felt on this occasion ; one day deprived me of Sather and hushand, one of which strokes had been Sufficient to have taken away
my life. I was carried from the

Do not weep, my daughter, Said my unhappy parent, embracing me, leave timid Souls to vent their grief in lamentation; your hushand and Sather have both been barbaroussy murdered before your eyes: it is your duty to revenge them; away with uSeleSs regret, let a noble Spirit of reSentment take place thereof ; Padillo’s blood can only expiate
ours. Adieu, my daughter. I would die contented----	,

86 The HISTORY of
I had no Sooner recovered a little from my Surprize, but I reSolved to execute my Sather’s last commands: he Seemed in dying to have transmitted his courage to me. I cauSed the bodies of my father and hushand to be dressed in the Same cloaths they had on when killed, laid them on a litter, and transported them to the council-houSe of Seville, where, in the preScnce of the grand corregidor and other officers of justice, I uncovered the corps, and shewed them
the wounds. Animated by Such a bloody Spedlacle, I inSisted upon Speedy and exemplary SatisSadion : I was promised it; but, alas! little did I know that justice could be hoodwinked by gold: Don JoSeph corrupted his judges, and was acquitted.
What was my Surprize and indignation on hearing the issue of this affair; I could not have believed that
in-

interest could have prevailed in a matter oS Such an atrocious nature. What, Said I, in the heat oS my transport, shall the most horrid crimes find protedlors in thoSe who ought to be the guardians of innocence.? can they thus shamefully betray their trust and honour for a petty bribe ? Interest alone is the Spring of all their adions; none need Seek the protection of the laws any longer, Since they are thus openly violated; our destiny now depends on a few men, whom their mean extradlion, their want of principles, their ignorance and love of money, would make us rather regard as villains and assassins than proper depositaries of the lives and fortunes of their fellow citizens.
Thefe complaints were too well grounded; but, alas! very uSeleSs for a heart that burnt with thirst of a Speedy and just revenge : I thereSore

I dressed mySelf in man’s cloaths, and in that diSguife went to Seek Padillo in a villa he had in the country near Seville, whither he had retired Since the determination of his trial. It was late when I arrived; Padillo’s Servants ashed my name and my buSineSs with their master; I called mySelf a gentleman, whom night had overtaken on his journey, and wanted a lodging
till the morning. My anSwer Seemed Satisfactory, and they ushered me up to their master’s apartment. The fight of a perSon that had murdered my father and hushand, made me tremble with horror. He did not know me, but received me very politely, and ordered an apartment for me that was Separated from his own
by a gallery. Every thing Seemed to
Sa*-
CONSTANTIN 89
favour my deSign. When the hour to retire was come, I took leave of Padillo, who shewed me himSelS to the room he had destined Sor me, and immediately retired to his own. A thouSand reste(stions crowded in upon me; I Sometimes shuddered at the attempt I was meditating: I was shocked at the thoughts of killing a perSon who had received me So hoS-pitably under his roof, and wished to have been lefs civilly treated. On the other hand, my dying hushand and father preSented themSelves to my remembrance : I called to mind my father’s last injundfions, the injustice I had received, the assassin’s triumph, and the obligation I was under to avenge the death of perSons fo dear to me ; all which restedlions made a deep impression on me. At last my determination followed this storm of confuSed ideas; the thoughts of revenge took place of thoSe of pity.
I roSe

I hesstated long whether I should open the door, the horror of the night, the approach of the critical minute, perhaps the weakneSs that is inseparable from our Sex, all con Spired together to shake my resolution ; add
to this the fear I was in, lest Padillo should be awake. Nevertheless the profound calm that reigned in the houSe, the tranquility with which my enemy Seemed to rest, Sufficiently indicated that this was the fittest time for my enterprize. I opened the door at length, and entered Padillo’s room: the faint glimmering of a wax taper placed at his bed*Side, afforded but just light enough to let me Sec my vidim: he Slept profoundly, with his breast uncovered; fortune, either good or bad, Seemed to have put him

This is the assassin, Said I to mySelf, the destroyer of my family, whom interest has Screened from justice: my father, and you my hushand, shall Soon be avenged; the barbarous villian is going to receive the punishment of his cruelty; this hand shall be his executioner. I liSted up my arm to give him the fatal blow; I already pointed the weaoon tg his
when a Sudden Sentiment of compaS-Sion overpowered me all at once: I let fall the Sword; I thought it beneath me to owe my revenge to trea^ chery.

He awaked, bathed in his own blood: he wanted to Spealc, but nature refuSed its assistance. He fixed his eyes attentively on me, and knew me to be the perSon he had lodged in his houSe. Rage and deSpair glowed in his face; but in a moment gave way to the paleneSs which approach-^ ing death Spread over his countenance. Die, cried I, unhappy wretch, die,
not by the hand of any man, but by a woman’s, who has revenged her-Self: know that I am Blanche, whole father and hushand you So cruelly murdered.
On hearing this he endeavoued to throw himSelf out of bed, and advance towards me: my name Seemed

to have reanimated his SenSes; he darted a Surious look at me; rage Seemed to stay his departing Soul, but the first step he made out of his bed conSigned him to the arms of death; his knees gave way, and he fell breathlefs at my Seet.
I left his room with precipitation,
I went into the garden, and eScaped over the walls. After travelling the whole night I arrived about break of day at Seville. I returned to my own lodgings quite Spent with fatigue, my mind filled with a thouSand horrid ideas, and my heart beating as if it would leave my body.

This Secured me from the proSecution of Padillo’s family; yet overcome by Sentiments of a conScious fear I could not diS-Sipate, I was going to Seek Some place of retreat distant from Seville, when I heard that one of Padillo’s Servants was committed to priSon on Suspicion, and was on the point of i^being condemned. This news made me change my resolution; I immediately determined to clear the Innocent, and rather loSe my own life

Notwithstanding my impending fate I fiept Soundly; the apprehension of death did not disturb my re-poSe.

The fatal day was at hand, when, in the middle of the night, my priSon-door opened, I heard a voice fay to me, Be not alarmed, and make no noiSe; I will deliver you from the hands of your persecutors. That instant I felt Somebody take hold of my arm; I Sustered mySelf to be con-du(5led without the least relistance, though I did not know who my deliverer was.

This favour, replied I, is much above ray esteem, which is all I can offer you. Your esteem! interrupted the stranger hastily: alas! when you know who I am, you will perhaps think it your duty to deny me even that. What I have done might claim Some merit, and your gencroSity

For heaven’s Sake, Said I, eaSe my trouble, let me know to whom I am indebted Sor my liberty: can you doubt ray gratitude ? He anSwered me only with a Sigh.

reached the end oS the wood. Who

I could not but pity and esteem him, which hisgeneroSity and humanity most truly deServed. Duty and honour required no more than that I should keep the favourable Sentiments I began to entertain for Don Garcia to mySelf, and he was unhappy enough in not knowing them.
This young nobleman was very different Srom his brother: a thouSand good qualities rendered him amiable in the eyes of all the world; he had no other fault but that of being

Don Garcia, during the remaining part of our journey, shewed me all possible reSpedt; his eyes indeed, leSs timid than his lips, entertained me every moment with his love; but the fear of offending, checked him from giving me any other mark of it.. Both of us were unhappy, and neither could See any proSpect of relief.
We arrived at length at Madrid, my uncle received us very affedlio-nately ; I told him the obligations I laid under to Don Garcia, but had the precaution to conceal his name and family. The day of Separation at last came, that fatal day which has embittered the remainder of my life. I would have willingly avoided Seeing Don Garcia, and v/as aSraid lest he should read the the trouble of my heart in my countenance;

Alas I vouchSaSe me but one look of pity, to Soften the rigour oS my Sate, or See me expire at your Seer, Don Garcia threw himSelf at my feet, he bathed them with his tears; then my resolution began to fail, tender Seelings took place of duty, and I was on the point of acknowledging my weakneSs.

He remained raotionleSs, almost expiring, and even without the power of complaining.
He begged to See me once more, ■before he Sat out on his journey, but I was inflexible, reaSon had reSumed her Sway in my mind.

His abSence rendered him still dearer to me ; I gave mySelS up entirely to grief, and it was now too late for any means to deSpel it, as I my-Self had refuSed the cure : I was pining away in a distemper for which I Saw no remedy. Alas I what an unhappy being am I, Said I to my-Self, how unaccountable is my Sate!

It is impossible to deScribe, continued Blanche, the transports of grief and deSpair I was in : you know, without doubt, the power of love ; you will eaSily imagine liow diSmal and terrible my Situation was.

This, continued Blanche, all in tears at the remembrance,, was my only conSolation. Don Garcia’s heart stood me in ‘stead of company, Sriends, and all other earthly comforts.

Constantia readily accepted Blanche’s offer, and they hastened to the a-partment. Blanche opened the door and entered first. With v/hat horror was Constantia Seized at Such a mournful fight! There stood at the farther end of the room a table in form of a tomb, covered with black velvet, on which Don Garcia’s heart was placed. A Silver lamp, Suspended over each end of the tomb, shed a faint light over this melancholy Scene. All the horrors of death Seemed to dwell in this dreary man-fion, the fight of which alone was enough to deprive one of life.

Constantia pressed Blanche to re-Sume the thread oS her history. Octavio and Julia joined their requests to hers; but they little knew what Sad reverSes of fortune were awaiting them, Blanche thus reSumed her story:
I was now quite habituated to melancholy; reading and ressedlion was almost the only pleaSure I was capable of enjoying. I uSed Sometimes to walk out by the Side of the wood. One day I entered farther into it than uSual, my mind entirely occupied with Don Garcia, when the cries of an infant reached my ears; I listened for Some moments, then struck into a path that Seemed to lead to the place Srom whence the cries came: at every step I advanced, they encreaSed, which made me think I

Some paces distant from the child lay an old man, covered with wounds, who appeared to have expired but a Sew moments before. I was struck'with horror at the fight, and at a loSs what to do ; but my heart immediately determined me in favour oS the unhappy in-Sant. When we our Selves have ex-perienced misSortunes, we are the more inclined to pity and relieve others. I look upon every unSor-tunate perSon as my brother and Sister; afflidlion alone is enough to interest me in Savour of a stran-

Is it really So, Said Odiavio, embracing her, am I not your Son.? ah! why did you not leave me in an error that was dearer to me than life ? or am I unworthy to be called your Son ? If fate has denied me that hap-pineSs, I poffeSs at least for you all the Sentiments a Son ought to have; and you, dear mother, (allow me still the endearing expression) which I owe you by So many ties, regard me still at least as an unhappy youth, who is doubly yours, both by his misfortunes and the affedlion he beafs you.
Blanche could not diSengage her-Self from Odlavio’s arms, their faces were bathed in tears. Constantia

Constantia could not recover from her Surprize.

Such a Situation is eafier conceived than expressed : take this and read it, continued Constantia, giving the letter to her daughter, and let me learn the full extent of my mif-fortunes.
Blanche was chilled with horror; Constantia fainted anew. Julia took the letter trembling, and read it with a new addition of fear; its contents were as follow:

Julia and Odtavio, when the other
*•
two were gone, remained in profound Silence, with their eyes fixed on the ground. Julia even trembled to raiSe hers towards Odlavio. Nature taught them both how different the names of brother and Sister are from thoSe of lover and mistreSs; that they could not love each other So tenderly as formerly; and that an insurmountable bar was now put to their future union.
When it was time to retire, Fare-wel then, my brother. Said Julia ; farewel, Sister, replied Odlavio. With what pain was that word pronounced by both; they knew not from whence it proceeded, but they felt they were unhappy, without being able to diS-

128 The HISTORY of
Nature, in creating pleaSures, has formed them of different; degrees, Some are more lively, others more tranquil; the enjoynient of the one is aeccnipanied with trouble, indifference follows the other; the affection we bear to a Sister is not So strong as what we feel for a mistreSs. This difference ariSes from an imperfe<ffion inherent in our nature, which will
i
not allow us to relish pure and innocent pleasures, though they only deServe that name, SenSe always predominates in the heart, which is only touched by what is groSs; and this js what keeps the Soul in igho* ranee of herSelf. Who can mend this defedl in us, but the Same nature
that has made it ?
As Soon as Constantia found her-
felf alone, she gave free vent to her Sorrow. She was Sometimes all ten-derneSs, at others all rage and deS-
pair;
CONSTANTIN 129
pair; a thouSand times did she wish St. Val and her rival in her power, to plunge a dagger into both their hearts; again she looked upon him with compassion, and imputed every thing to Sate. Thus St. Val appeared either innocent or guilty by turns, according to the passion that Swayed
her.
Julia was no leSs agitated than Constantia ; the name of brother was
a weight she could not Support; how
' ♦
charming, on the other harid, did that of lover appear! Alas! Odtayio, Said she to herSelS, all is over; ties of blood Separate us for ever; the Sa,rne nature which has united our hearts Sorbids' us to think oS any other union.

. Julia was almost distracted with the continual struggles she underwent. Sometimes she reproached herSelf for her tenderneSs towards Octavio, but then it was only reaSon that Spoke on the other hand, her heart accuSed her for not loving him enough.
In vain do we try to root out our inclinations, we may lop the branches, but the trunk will always remain: let reaSon do what it will, love will always bear, the Sway.

Such a Spedacle would have-moved a heart leSs tender than Julia’s: she advanced towards Odavio, and attempting to take his hand, which he held out to her, Sunk upon the bed.

If I was ever dear to you, O take care of Julia, let her occupy the place I held in your affedion, let my.ssster Odavio could not proceed, a deadly Sweat bedewed his face, his eyes grew dim, a Sudden tremor shook his whole Srame; he bathed Julia, whom he held in his embrace, with his

Blanche and Constantin called to him in vain, he heard them not; even Julia had vanished from his fight, and the Soul Seemed only to Sufpend its flight from the regret he had to leave Julia behind him.
TheSe two lovers as they had lived So stridUy united, So they Seemed ready to expire together. Constantiawas in tears, she was apprehenSive for the life of her daughter; this new stroke redoubled the weight of the first.

Blanche ordered an apartment to be prepared for the stranger; but he declined going to rest, and choSe to Spend the night by Odlavio, who began to give hopes of recovery.
The stranger told them, that as he was riding through the wood with his Servant, they were Set upon by four villains, who had, dragged them both to a cave, leaving their horSes bound to a tree without. After

I hoped. Said he, to have come in time to Succour my deliverer; but heaven has been pleaS-ed to deprive me of that SatisSadlion.

The STRANGER’S History.
\
I W A S born at Paris of a good family; there were two brothers of us, both unhappy, both vidims of love. Our father left us at his death poS-Seffed of a very considerable Sortune; an affair of honour obliged my brother to leave his native country. I for my part gave mySelf up to all the uSual amuSements of thoSe of my years, without attachment to any one in particular.
One day as I was going to Versailles, there happened a young gentleman, with his Sister and her waiting-maid, to be in the coach with

me; I had no Sooner cast my eyes on the lady than my heart Selt one of thoSe Sudden impressions we cannot difcern the cauSe of, and which fix the Soul irreSistably : she Seemed to be between Seventeen and eighteen. An air of melancholy Spread over her Sace heightened her charms. She had the graces of misfortifne, graces more powerful, more penetrating, and more moving than any other whatsoever: adverSity gives beauty an interest in every one that beholds it, and by shewing itIeSs haughty, invites more strongly to love it, as our love to Such an objed Seems a debt owing to humanity ; and Such a passion always makes a rapid progreSs in a generous mind. Such is the noble Source of thoSe passions which the greatest part of mankind termed romantic. A perSon capable of tender impressions, must have a great fund of

12 The HISTORY OF
SenSibility, Sentiments oS probity, and a taste Sor every virtue, and then one is almost always Sure to be unhappy : however in the height of our distreSs we enjoy the idea oS thinking we are Superior to the rest of mankind ; that onr being is more per-Se(st, our Soul more elevated, becauSe more Senssbie. Thus every body, if they loSe on one hand, strive, to gain on the other; and even Srom adverSi-ty itSelf draw conSolation.
TheSe resse<stions have interrupted the thread of my story; however, they may be necessary to acquaint you with my way of thinking, Srom whence you may eaSily judge, that a heart formed like mine is SuScepti-ble of Seeling all the strength of love, and experience all its reverSes.
During our journey the young lady Spoke little ; I obServed her oSten lift her eyes to heaven and ssgh ; she
even
CON ST ANTI A. 13
even shed many tears, which she strove to conceal. How much did they already affed me ! I wished to make her Sufferings my own, by sharing them. But in proportion as I loved the Sister, I Selt nothing but hatred for the brother: it was as if nature had informed me, that he was the cauSe of the Sorrow I remarked in the lovely stranger. In fine I conceived a diSlike to him without knowing the cauSe.
We parted at Verfailles, after paying mutual compliments on Such oc-cassons, which are generally nothing
but words of courSe.
The fair stranger had already stung me into that charming reverie, that Sweet melancholy, which is the cha-radleristic of an infant passion. ’ At dinner I eat little. Spoke still leSs, and towards the evening eScaped from a numerous company to go to the

park, and to refle(5t upon my preSent Situation, to examine my heart, or in reality to indulge my growing passion, which is all the Sruit we reap Srom our enquiries on Such occaSions. I choSe, as you will eaSily imagine, the most gloomy and Solitary walk. I was drawn from this enchanting muSing by two perSons difcourSing together in an adjoining thicket: a Secret im-pulSe obliged me to lend an attentive ear, and I clearly distinguished a woman’s voice.
Alas! Said one shedding a flood of tears, ceaSe my dear Marianne, ceaSe your endeavours to comfort me, all my hopes are gone. I am Sacrificed to my brothers avarice, made a vidim to their ambition ; they intend to bury me for the remainder of my life in a convent, and force me to take the vov/s : they Seek my death.

Alas! what would my father Say, if he Saw me thus abandoned, and Sacrificed to the avarice of his other children ! LoSing him I lost every thing; fortune, friends, and even life, for I feel I shall not long Survive Such cruel uSage.
Believe, madam, replied the other, that I will do all in my power to aS-Sift you to prevent their cruel defigns: though I am but a Servant, be assured no body can be more attached to your interest than I am; I Seel all your Sorrows as if they were my own, they pierce to my inmost Soul.

If you once enter a cloyster, you are for ever lost. You shall remain concealed in our village; my brother will attend and Serve you.

Who could imagine that, in So low a rank, one should find Sentiments worthy of the most exalted station, while theSe cruel brothers through a mean and Sordid love of money, break through at once the ties of nature and humanity ? Alas, without doubt, the lady I Saw this morning whoSe image is too strongly engraved in my heart, is no JeSs unhappy : her brother, I fear, too much refernbles theSe I now heard of, it is perhaps the Same ; S must fee this stranger.
Moved by an impulSe I could not reSist, I roSe hastily Srom my Sear, I stole along the hedge which Separated us, till I found a gate which I half

She had fine large black eyes, the langour pf which did not diminish their lustre ; her dreSs, though negligent, gave her in’ my eyes more graces than iSit had been the most Sumptuous in the world. In this manner was my lovely stranger a Second time offered to my view. Whaca progreSs did love make at that moment in my Soul, already but too much his stave!
In my first motion I was going to throw mySelS at her Sect-, but on reflexion, or rather another impulSe stronger than the first, I stopt. It immediately occurred to me the lady might have an attachment, which inspired

I receive your offers. Sir, Says she, with all the gratitude that is due to them ; but they can be oS no uSe to me. Why should you trouble your-Self about an unfortunate creature, whom destiny Seems to perSecute ? My fate has already determined—Death is the only remedy I can hope for.
Death! replied I, with warmth. No, madam, my days shall be Spent in procuring you happineSs. J will go and reproach your brothers with their inhumanity : if I cannot move them in your behalf, I will, at least, place you out of the reach of their Sury. Do not fear, madam, heaven Sends you an avenger in me, a faithful friend; I do not Say the most tender and passionate lover.

deavoLirs to render you happy, should I be for ever miserable. If you will not receive as a lover one that adores you, only look on me as a friend, who takes a great concern in your welfare as yourSelf, and who would Save you from the danger that threatens you at the expence of his life. You weep, madam ; am I the unhappy cauSe of your tears, who, to keep them from stowing, would shed the last drop of my blood ? Speak, madam, do not heSitate to follow the advice of a perSon, whom one look of yours has more strongly attached to you than all the ties of nature. Be affured I shall always pay a due regard to your virtue ; and shall put it out of the power of SuSpicion to hurt your charader. I will condudt you to Paris to one of my aunts: you will be a daughter to her, her comfort. I repeat it again, I do not
pretend
CONSTANTIN 23
pretend that the gift of your heart should acquit you of what you owe me ; that shall be as you determine : only not to hate, but to pity me, and be happy yourSelf, is all I exadt of you.
This is too much anSwered the stranger, you fill me with admiration and esteem ; who then could refuSe you her heart with Such Sentiments? On Saying this a modest blush reddened her cheek, and heightened her beauty : her embarasshient threw me into transport.
We conversed a long time about her Samily, and the barbarity of her brothers. She told me it was in vain to hope they would change their intentions and that they were reSolv-ed to get rid of her, that they might share the fortune left her by her father. I learnt alSo that her uncle, to aggrandize the family, had come

into their views. At length we were obliged to Separate, after promiSing to meet to-morrow in the Same place, attended only by her waiting-maid,
I retired quite Sul! of my passion, entirely perSuaded that love alone would render me happy for the rest of my days.
At length,. Said I to mySelf, I am completely happy : I love ; and what is the objedS of my love.? beauty, misfortune, and virtue! How many chains to bind me! My fortune is Sufficient to share with a perSon who gives me her heart; that is the only treasure I deSire. I can alSo render her happy whom I love : her misfortunes will make her love me the more, and give me a new claim to her affedlions. But no, I will not have gratitude mixt with love; every other Sentiment is foreign to it. All
I want is, that she love me as she
would

would love the tenderest oS adorers, and I shall be Satisfied.
I hastened, or rather stew, to the place oS rendezvous. How great was my rapture to find her there before me! She told me her brothers were to stay a Sortnight at Versailles, to regulate Some particular affairs, and then intended to bury their unhappy viclim in a convent. We concerted the means of frustrating their execrable Scheme; and reSolved, that she with her maid, should take reSuge at my aunt’s.
I had, nevertheless, the weakneSs to delay the execution of our enter-prize. I wanted to ad in a manner more agreeable to my love. I employed Tome of my friends of the first rank to propoSe to her brother that we would make over her fortune to him, if he would conSent to our union. He heard their proposals

He received me with haughtineSs, although my rank was equal to his own. He told me, that it was fixed and determined by the whole Samily, his Sister should finish her days in a convent.
I was enraged, I threatened, I Soothed, yea even begged, and shed tears. I ashed but his Sister, and offered to give up her fortune with all her pretenSions: but could obtain nothing. His arrogant inhumanity kindled my indignation to Such a degree, that I was ready to challenge him. My love, nevertheless, restrained . me, I had yet Some Saint gleam oS hope ; and the Sister made

I went to the park as uSual, but
Sound no .body there; I waited a long time; Some Sorebodings oS my misfortune began to disturb me; I trembled Sor her I loved ; I was upon the rack of SuSpence, when I perceived Marianne at Some distance. A Sudden joy darted through all my veins. I expected her mistreSs was Soilowing her *, I looked, but could not See her; a new fear Seized me.
Marianne came up to me all in tears, and raiSingher hands to Heaven, Alas, Sir, Said she, my poor lady is undone; you are the cauSe of her ruin ; her cruel brother has put her under confinement, where she is to remain till she Sets out for the convent. He has informed her of your villt, reproached her with your love, and even had the cruelty to diSmiSs me

DeSpair and fury Suddenly Seized on my SenSes, 1 lost all utterance, my heart was filled with the horrors of Sorrow and rage, I was struck life-leSs. At length I recovered a little : Approach, Said I to the girl, take my life, kill me, I am a monster; yes, I am the cauSe of this diSaster, I am the wretch that has betrayed your miS-treSs. Shall I then See her no more .? I will punish mySelS: I have no other choice leSt.
So Saying, I drew my Sword, and was going to plunge it into my breast, when Marianne, all in tears, catching hold of my hand, and falling on her knees beSore me, cried,
Heavens,

29
Heavens, what are you about.? think, my mistreSs still lives, that she loves you, that she has no reSource but you, and that you alone can deliver her from her distreSs.
Well then, replied I, with a Settled Sury, I will live, I will live to tear the Soul out of that unworthy brother ; he shall die by my hand. Marianne, do not defpair, I am ready to undertake, to execute every thing: you shall See your mistreSs again, I will beg her SorgiveneSs on my knees, yes, I will expiate all the crimes my folly has been the occafion of; I will shed tears to the last drop of my blood for her, I will die or avenge her.
At last we determined to take the opportunity when the barbarian should be our, to Set her at liberty.

Alas, Sir, how she is changed! but may I hope then to See her again ? Yes,. continued I, you shall See her again, I will give you a letter Sor one of my Sriends, who lives at St. Dennis; you will wait for us there. I gave her the letter and

Half an hour after midnight, we heard the noiSe of a coach coming towards us. We could distinguish the voices of thofe that vyere in the carriage,whichl immediatelyknew to be her and her brother.

I reSolved to Spend Some months at his country-Seat in order to conceal my-Self, and wait the conSequences of our adventure with more tranquility, after his chaplain had married us privately at his hoLiSe in town.
I found my Self the happiest man on earth, possessed of all I adored, and loaded with favours by the count. The night following we Set out for the count’s Seat; how little, how mean appeared to me thoSe purSuits that employ the rest of mankind I my SpouSe was the whole univerSe to me.

The history of
My days glided on in happineSs our place of retreat, which would have Seemed a defert to any other perSon, was the most beautiSul Spot in the world to me.
My Sriends at Paris inSormed me, that my wiSe’s brothers made the stridlest Search in order to diScover the place we had retired to. We had changed our names: but, alas, the melancholy period approached that was to put an end to our happineSs ; Sor Since that Satal moment, I have dragged on liSe as a chain Srom which I wished every moment to be delivered.
One night, a dreadSul nijght Sor me, and the last I pasted with my too unSortunate SpouSe, I started from my Sleep, awaked by a that chilled me with horror, my wiSe who shrieked, frightened by a dream. I am ready to die, Said she,

all trembling, I just now dreamed that we vvere in a magnificent palace,
the appearance of which was heightened by the brightestday I ever Saw. A phantom aroSe Srom the earth, the palace vanistied, and I Sound my Self in a. vault, only lightened by , a dim lamp, by which I could perceive tio-tbing but bones of dead perSons Scattered all around me, and fragments of broken coffins, I called out to yOIL for help; instead of which the Same phantom came towards me, wrapt in a shroud, with a drawn Sword in his hand : die unhappy wretch, Said he, with a hollow voice, know you not who I am ? I am death. The Same instant I looked round, and Saw no way to eScape but by a dreadful Sea, through which I tried to Swim,,
This dream has leSt a terrible impression on my Spirits. I know you

As she Spoke, the tears flowed in abundance from her eyes. I endeavoured to encourage her by my careS-Ses, and every argument I could think of, to perSuade her that dreams were but a delufion of the imagination. Alas, I mySelf was not in reality more tranquil, I could not diSpel my own fears, and stood in need of that comfort I endeavoured to give her, I loved my SpouSe too well not to enter into all her Sentiments, as vve must do of thoSe we fincerely love.
Whether it was an exceSs of ten-derneSs, or a foreboding I could not account for, I mySelf trembled at my wife’s dream. Nevertheless, day restored my Spirits and tranquility, I

have I but you to comfort and assist me ? Your arguments are of no weight; I cannot diSpel the fears I am agitated with; I conjure you by your affedion do not leave me.
How great were my struggles! I embraced my wife ; I could not tear my Self from her arms; I was often ready to weep without knowing why ; nor could I overcome my emotions. I thought I never loved her So much. I took leave of her, I returned again Several times, a Secret and invincible motion still bringing me back. Some*

However, I determined not to give ear to theSe Suggestions, as I had pror miSed Several gentlemen to be of sheir party, whom I could not diSr appoint: I thereSore once more embraced my wiSe, though still with the Same agitation of mind. You distrefs me greatly. Said I; farewel, you shall Soon See me again. She followed me a long time with her eyes; and I often turned about to look at her.

He could proceed no farther, his fobs stopt the passage of his voice. She is. no more here, cried I, Seized with horror, whether then is she gone:
Sa.ying ,this, I Sainted away. My Servants by their assiduity, restored me to m.y SenSes : bur, alas, it was only to drag on a life a thouSand times bitterer than death itSelf.
They told me, that a little after my departure, a number of men, on horSeback, had come to my houSe ; that one among them, who Seemed

I was quite Spent with fatigue and ’ lassitude, a violent fever began to rage in my veins, and just as 1 was entering the inn, I fell from my horfe as from a precipice.

Constantia longed impatiently to See her St. Val. His brother approved of Odavio’s affedion for Julia;

If he had given way to Constantia’s impatience, he would have taken post diredlly to the place where the ship was to arrive ; but his stay there was absolutely necessary.

She therefore SoStly shut the door, and returned to her own apartment: the Scene she had been witneSs to, threw her into a profound reverie. She refolved after dinner to go back again to the stranger; but Some company calling upon St. Val, de-

You have restored me to life, replied the marquis, let us Speak no more of my misfortunes: in finding you, they are all forgotten.

She 'gave her father a ssncere account of her adventures, which drew from him many tears in hearing the extremities to which she had been reduced at Marseilles, and the unhappy accident that had Separated her from St. Val, when they were on the point of being united for ever.

The marquis, in his turn, acquainted his daughter with all the afflidfions he had undergone. The Son he had in the army was killed in a duel: the other, though of rank in the church, did not adl up to that Sacred charadler; for, finding, he could not perSuade his father to Settle his-Sister’s fortune on him, he had the barbarity to deprive the old marquis of the management of his estate, under pretence of dotage ; and had taken poffeshon of all that belonged to him. The marquis penetrated with grief, and left without reSource, maltreated by his unnatural Son, leSt Italy with a deSign to go to Paris to a relation of his deceaSed wiSe’s, and had been taken ill at Lyons, where his money was exhausted.

They embraced him with tender-neSs, and it was Soon agreed he should accompany them to Paris ; and from that moment each strove who should most contribute to make him forget his misfortunes.
Octavio observing an air of melancholy in Julia, which he had not perceived before his departure, took the first opportunity of Speaking to her alone : what is it. Said he, that makes you So Sad, my divine Julia, at a time you should give yourSelf

Here they were interrupted by St. Val and the old marquis, who bid them prepare instantly Sor their journey : at the Same time Octavio received a letter Srom Blanche, wherein she renewed the assurances oS her tenderneSs and affection, and next day they left Lyons.
Constantia was the most impatient of the company to reach Paris, where they at length, after a pleaSant journey, arrived in Safety. The marquis, with his daughter and Julia, lodged at St. Val’s, who Soon Separated Octavio from his mistreSs. He thought them too young to marry, and therefore propoSed his Son should first See Something of the world by entering into the army, and Serving a campaign. The fatal

She could proceed no farther, Sighs oppoSed the passage of her voice; she looked at her lover, and her tears redoubled. Odlavio was at her feet, and graSped her hand with extacy.

Let it Suffice to Say, that St. Val and the marquis retired from the world, and Spent the remainder of their days in Solitude, and that Constan-tia and Julia followed their example ; and, without taking the vows, gave themSelves wholly up to religious exercifes, the disappointments they had met with binding them stronger to that holy life than any ties whatsoever.
