WILLIAM RAYMOND, ESq.
MY DEAR SIR,
Harewood Grove
I	'
Arrived at this place last night about eight o’clock, after a very
M.
I met with
I '
my friend Charles and his lister Emma, who came there on purpofe to meet me. There appears a perfedt harmony in this amiable family.

Every one is studious to pleaSe. Even the Servants Seem to have caught the manners of their master. I cannot conceive a happier fituation for a man far advanced in years than that of Mr. Vernon, furrounded by his children, all studious to render the decline
of life as eafy as poffible, and postest-
#
ed withal of an ample fortune, which enables him to reward the duty, and provide for the future happinefs of his posterity, VVte are to be very gay whilst I remain here. Indeed where happinefs fo constantly refide?, it is not nostible that dulnefs.should
i.
long be a guest. A country life is Surely the most to be wished for. There is a Something in the stillnefs of the Scene, that tends to tranquillize the mind j So many objects that call
forth our admiration and wonder,
which

which are never Seen in the buSy tumultuous city ; or iS Seen, looked on with the eye of indifference. The man
of bufineSs has not time to view nature in her loveliest garb, and the man of fashion, runs diSgusted from every thing that feems to reproach him for the follies of which he is daily guilty. Artificial life and artificial manners, are what they are engaged in: nor would they bepleaSed with that man, who should endeavour to reafon them out of their folly. I wonder what apology they can make to them-felves, when they cast their eyes on
struDures mouldering into ruins, formerly the Seats of hoS-pitality and mirth, and where their ancestors laid the foundation of their fortunes, at the Same time that they materially affilled towards the aggran-

dizement of their countryI have
been led into this way of thinking by
having this morning witneffed the
«
decay of one of theSe monuments of former greatnefs. The day being remarkably fine, Mr.Vernon propofed that the ladies ifhould ride out with me, in order that I might view a beautiful profpe<5l from the extremity of a hill, not four miles distant from the Hall. Accordingly we mounted ourhorSes, and arrived at this earthly paradiSe. It is not possible to view a richer profpect. Indeed the eye grew almost tired with the luxuri-
O
ance of the Scene, which extends for
more than thirty miles every way,

over the finest green fields, woods, lakes, rivers and mountains. At length my eye was arrested by an
object not more than two miles distant.

tant. It was the turrets of an old castle, emboSom’d in a wood which almost hid it from our view, but which, at the Same time, cast an air of grandeur and melancholy over the whole. I aSked, who owned that Sweet romantic Spot. The rats are the preSent poffessSors, replied the Sprightly Emma. Indeed, Mr. Neville,. Said her Sister Laura, we do not know who is the owner. It had been deSerted many years before we came to this part of the country. I have often rode round it, and lamented that time Should have made Such ravages on So Sweet a Spot. There was nothing more Said on the Subject; but, as we returned, the ladies wished' to pay a morning vifit to Lady Wentworth.

that I was not drested for a vifit to a
fine lady, and that I would ride round the Spot I had been just admiring, and attend them in leSs than an hour. To this they agreed, and I arrived at Raby Castle; which, indeed exhibited a Scene of

However, I
was not affrighted
from making a nearer approach, which

I did through a double row of stately

elms, forming an avenue of near a mile. In order to give you any idea of the castle, I can only fay, that it bore Some reSemblance to Holland HouSe near Kenfington j but was much larger, as well as built of stone, and consequently conveyed a
greater

greater air of magnificence. I alighted from my horSe and gave it to Mifs Vernon’s Servant, who came with me in order to point out the way, and without ceremony opened the front door, which I found without a lock. I entered a Spacious hall, which had formerly been laid with black and white marble, but of which very few traces were left. The stair-cafe, which came down on each fide of it, had been alSo of white marble, and the walls had been adorned with Some very fine historical paintings. I could See here and there a head, an
arm
or Some other marks of figures
%
that had been defaced by the damp,
which Seemed excestive. I then opened another door, which led into
a Spacious parlour; and, to my utter astonishment, found two or three

people

people actually at dinner in one cor-
of this room. Their Surprize at Seeing
a stranger of my appearance, amongst
them, being over, I took off my hat, and begged pardon for my intru-
fion, which they readily granted: and an old woman afked if my Honour would like to fee the castle. On this a venerable old man arofe from a great chair in which he had been fitting. His back being towards
the door, 1 had not Seen him be-*
fore. See the castle. Said he, lack-a-days, there is nothing now left worth feeing. It makes my heart ache when I only walk 'from one room to another.” Then, friend, I prefume you have Seen it in a more stourifhing state. Said I. “Yes, yes.

Here the old man wiped a tear from his eye, with the cuff of his coat, and made an inclination of his head, as if he meant to apologize* for his fenfibility. The rustics arofe* from their meal, and went about their different occupations. The woman still infisted that his Honour did not want to stand talking fo long, and that if he pleafed. She would Shew him the castle, and the beau-tifullest profpect ever was Seen from the battlements.. Only, She faid he must excufe her from Shewing a particular room in that wing, which was called Lady Mary’s, I enquired, the ,caufe—she faid, becaufe that

room was haunted, and though she had never feen the ghost, yet she knevi? thofe that had, and she was affear’d.

The
poor
creature was greatly affedted whilst he Spoke. I could with pleaSure have staid all day, to converSe with him, but my watch reminded me that it was time to return to the ladies. I was obliged to promiSe the old woman, that I would call again to See the proSpect. I put Spurs to my horSe and arrived at the Hall, just as the MiSs Vernons, who had been joined
by my friend Charles, were remounting to return home to dinner. I related my adventure, which pleaSed Mr.

That I may not infect you with my melancholy, I will give you a piece of news, that Sir William has just now told me, which is, that the gay MiSs Berkley is going to be married to Lord St. Auban.

their fending an infant to him, who was in no wife related to it; but de-firing him to be affured, that it would be one day claimed. That it was the request of the parents, that I might have the education of a gentleman ; and that there might come’ a time, when I might do honour to ‘	his

change I am at a loSs.
What I uSed
to construe into a partiality, was not, perhaps, intended as Such on his part, and I alone am to blame, I wisti I knew his thoughts on his first .en** trance into the parlour.
My Father Said, “ Well, Neville, here is your old Sweetheart come to
congratulate you on your arrival,** for he reached ihe Grove only two

wmA
hours before my Self. I believe I looked very fooliSh, for Charles laughed very heartily. Mr. Neville came up to me, and enquired after my health, and then of your Lady-Ship : though unknown, as, he was pleaSed to Say, you must be amiable becauSe honoured by my friendship.

Perhaps his heart is in London ; if not, I know no obstacle to his declaring himSelf, for I will not for a moment Suppofe my Father So unjust as to oppofe an union where two hearts are united.

As the peace of a beloved parent is at stake, my own, is a Secondary object.

occafioned by the remembrance that thofe hours are fled, and that each Succeeding one now paSfes in dreadful contrast. Your time is Spent abroad amongst a Set of men who will in time lay the foundation-of certain mifery to us both. I know it is not the duty of a wife to arraign the conduct of her huSoand: pardon me, then, for doing fo, and fay, that I fhall hold that place in

“ Laura

I had conssdered of the propofal he had made me of a commiffion before I left town. I would accept it with gratitude, and afterwards endeavour to convince my country, that I was not unworthy of his pa-

Perhaps too stie is partial to Sir James! It must be fo! I was induced to think on my last vifit to Harewood, that I was not indifferent to her. But her father no doubt has been fpeaking to her of Sir James, and convinced her that She ought to have higher views, than

I complimented her on her looks; Saying, (he was armed.at all points Sor captivating the beaus we Should meet at the Hall. ‘‘ This is very necestary, Mr. Neville, Said she, don’t you know that Lady JerSey is there and that it is impostible to look tolerable in her company, with*

I looked round the drawing room for Sir James de Grey, and not feeing him, I began to think that Mr. Vernon had been mistaken, and that our party was now complete, when a carriage drove up the

I must in justice Say, he is a most elegant man. He was drested in mourning, and I would fain have attributed his good looks to that circumstance. I obferved Mr. Vernon was studious to engage him in conversation, and to difplay thoSe accomplifhments in which he knew
the ladies uSually excelled. Shall I own to you, that on going to the mufic room, I felt a Secret Satisfaction to find Lady Jerfey infinitely Superior to Laura, both in voice and execution. Indeed, I never heard her fing worfe. Before v/e parted, Mr. Oshorne gave Sir James a general invitation to the Grove. We returned home not in

we parted Sor the evening Soon after we arrived at home. I did not go to bed, but walked in the wood for two hours, exclaiming against the caprices of fortune. I affure you I am

A.T length I am eScaped from, alt the formalities of life, and begin tci breath again..
Vernon and I left Hare wood yef-terday morning,about eight o’clock-Lady Jerfey questioned me as ta the bufineSs I was called away upon^ It was out of my power to tell the truth, and therefore I made hec believe any lye that came into my
head.
The first pershn I Saw after my arrival was a certain lady who' iifed
E c	to
$2 THE LABYRINTHS OF LIFE.
to flatter herSelf that the name of JerSey would fit very well upon her. She looked very- lovely, and, for the first time, I Serioufly repented being married—She hardly returned my bow, but about half an hour after I Saw her footman fpeak to my valet, and when I drefifed I afked him—was not that Lady SuSan Strangeway’s Servant you fpoke to, Lo Brun ? Yes, Sir, he came to afk me how long you had been here, and how long you propoSed staying, and whether my Lady was
with you. I told him her Ladyship was at Harewood.—The fellow was filent; and. I did not chuSe to be

more particular, as I never was fond of making a confidants of my domestics.
But,
THE LABYRINTHS OP LIFE. 83
But, Edmund, it is plain Lady Su« San only affects indifference, and I (hall like to humble her pride.
Vernon has fallen fouce over head and ears in love with a pretty French milliner, who fits tacking together a parcel of gauze caps; they are exchanging glances at this moment; for her shop is directly oppofite my window.
We go to the rooms to-morrow evening; this I know is imprudent
in my prefent fituation, but I muff meet my charmer, she may relent and admit me again into favour. If fo, I shall fpend my time agreeably enough: for it is abfolutely ne-ceffary to be engaged in fome in*

thefe, and charity fays Some one must take care of them.
I believe you correfpond with Neville. Pray be careful not to hint to him that you know where I am, as he is frequently vifiting Lady Wentworth.

St. Auban, I understand, is expedted here. Pray fend me word if any Jracas has happened at Lady Berkley’s, as I have never Seen his marriage announced, and he would not leave town alone without Some reaSon.
I SuSpedl your friend Neville is in love with Laura Vernon. Poor

I shall still take the privilege of friendship in writing on a Subjed that at preSent engrofies all my attention. I shall hope to meet with
Some indulgence, except where your observation can point out any marked
impropriety. The paffion I have imbibed in my earlier years, I am convinced, will be for ever interwoven with the remainder of my existence.

In order that I might not be unprepared for his reception, he must inform me, he Said, that Sir James came with the intent of offering me his hand, and this with his entire approbation. He hoped that Sir James would be received on my part without any reluDance, as he had Some time ago Spoken to me on the fubjedl; and I had neither then or fince made any objection.

He Said that Sir James was not to be trifled with. As I had not any material objection, he expected that he should be properly received. Time and Sir James’s affiduities, he had no doubt, would incline me to think still more fovourably of him.

There I was to be disappointed again ; for rny Father joined Mr. Neville at the extremity of the Elm Walk; which put it out of my power to endeavour to palliate my fault. Nay, I thought that perhaps my Father might be talking on the Subject that was,at that time nearest to his heart, and thereby be adding force to the wound already given.

1 Think you wished your letter to arrive in one of my deSpairing moments : may every wish oS your heart meet with as ample gratification, and then you will be Supremely blest. Hope was never long a refident in my breaSt. It has frequently shot acroSs my mind, like a flash of lightning, only to render darknefs more viSible. I am the adopted child of miSery; therefore any endeavour I may make towards happineSs is but struggling against the stream. I yield
to my fate, and
no longer at

tempt at what is beyond my aim, I am glad that neceffity obliges me to quit this place, as I have orders
to join my regiment
I have been
weak enough to stay here till the lad moment. Sunday is the day fixed for my departure : to stay beyond that is impoffible.
WTat renders my being obliged to go at this crifis still more dreadful is, that the objedl of my affedtions Seels this Separation equally with mySelf; yet is llie destined to the arms of another, and I am mySelf the dreadful cauSe of that destiny. Delicacy too long with-held me from declaring my paffion to Laura ; before (he knew I loved her she had given her Father a prcmiSe to become the wife of Sir James de Grey: that once
given, although partly extorted, how

1 dare not preSume to attempt the

gaining over Mr. Vernon to my interest. Even in my most Sanguine moments, I always deemed that impossible. His honour is pledged, his daughter’s conSent given. Yet what 1 dare not, that will Laura attempt
^	jL
this evening. Her father loves her aSfedlionately—She hopes every thing from his goodnefs. We have been all this morning raifing obstacles, then Surmounting them, then contending with fresh ones starting up. In short we are in a labyrinth of

How happy are you, Edmund, born to an affluent fortune, the Sole delight of two most amiable parents, and at liberty to pay your addrelfes to most women within your own circle; but I don’t know how, it is the poffeS-ffon of bleffings .that makes us ungrateful beings infenfible to their real
value. I allow the justice of the Sentiment expreffed in a line of a favourite author of mine:
“ How bleffings brighten as they take their

way of gaiety, as all the ladies expect great attention from us young en-Signs; and my preSent fituation renders me totally inSenfible to every thing except where my heart is engaged.
You talk of change of objects and amuSements; I am of a different opinion from you on this Subject, 1 think that the greatest of all absurdity is an endeavour to fly from one’s Self; I could be as much alone in the midst of a crouded aflembly as in the most dreary forest.

"x OUR letter has penetrated my
very Soul; not with the pangs of guilt, for I am not conScious of one adtion, through the courSe of a very unpleaSant life, that could ever raiSe the blufh of shame on my cheek.
As to the obScurity of my birth, that ought rather to give me a claim to the protedlion of Society, than to drive me with diSgrace from it. I
have never Sullied the charadfer of

a gentleman. As Such I was received into your family. I have to protect the honour of a Soldier, and the
rights

rights oS an Englishman j both which I hold as Sacred 'as the man who boasts the proudest ancestry. TheSe are my only inheritance ; and with my life only will 1 give them
up.
To have felt the influence of beauty, both mental and perfonal, cannot be a crime ; and with more than this, you, Sir, cannot charge me. Love is an involuntary pastion 1 I admired, in filence, thofe charms and accomplishments, to the poffeS-lion of which I dared not to in Spire. Accident discovered to me, that your charming daughter honoured me with a preference. I will not Say, for fear of giving offence, how dear the discovery of this is to me: yet you your Self, Sir, will judge how highly

The letter you wrote to me, I
would not have anSwered to
any
other perfon. I know the value of the treaSure in your poffestion, and can feel for the anxiety of a parent in the difpoSal of it. Yet, as I am about to quit your family for ever, I cannot leave it under the imputation of ingratitude. Be astured that I have felt your’s and your Son’s many

To whatever difficulties my fate may expoSe me hereafter, the pangs-of the prefent moment may be equalled, but can never be exceeded.
You, Sir, may give your daughter to a man of rank and fortune, but whether you will either enfure her happinefs or your own, is doubtfuL
The affections are not to be controlled ; nor, once bestowed, to be recalled.
Under the conviction of this truth, I shall only Say, that the time may arrive when I can with propriety urge my claim to an alliance with your family, and when you may, without indignation, receive it.

Know your astonishment will be great when you receive this letter, and See its date. I am just arrived at this place in my way to town. I tore mySelf last night from all I hold deafest on earth. It contains
the only objedl of my hope or fear. I could not bring mySelf to bid you adieu in the cold and common form of civility, and a tenderer was im-poffible.
I have received a letter from your Father, that your gentle nature would
be

be shocked at. My proud Spirit was in arms. The recollection that it was Laura’s Father who wrote it,
d
disarmed my anger, and grief took poffeffion, where rage had lost its
influence.
That I am unworthy of So much excellence, need not be told me. I every instant feel my inferiority. Ever fince the moment when I first found I was not totally indifferent to you, I have determined to diScloSe a Secret, of which, however, I am certain you must be now in pof-Sefiion. A certain dread, I will not
“	m
call it shame, with-held me : but I had determined last night, at all
events, to See you, and diScover my whole fituation. Your kind foli-citude to quiet my apprehenfions.

led you to diScloSe to your Father my partiality.
By a letter from Mr. Vernon, I was instantly convinced, that you had met with the kindneSs you ex-
pedted.
It was impossible to See
either of .you after the receipt of it,
%
and to linger about the houfe like a guilty wretch, for a few hours longer, I could not bear.' I took my horfe, and, in an abSolute fit of phrenzy, arrived at Elford.
As I pasted the Vicarage, Maria
was fitting near the window of her dressing-room, with the shutters half clofed. 1 stopped fome minutes to deliberate whether I should not take my leave of her. On determining to the contrary, I put fpurs to my horfe, and did not stop for the distance of more than a mile : I then
wished
THE LABYRINTHS OF LIFE I
33
wished to return, and take another view of the Vicarage and Maria, as I knewi that she would See you before 1 should.
My horSe decided in favour of my return ; for as I was wavering, he turned round, and I purSiied his di-
recftion. The cl 'ck struck eleven as

I reached the church-yard.
The village was wrapped in filence, except the yelping of a cur, which the approach of my horSe had awakened. I Surveyed Mr. Arnold’s houfe. Not the least glimpSe of light could be observed. Maria’s window was cloSed. It was impostible for me to disturb the family. I laid the reins over the horSe’s neck, and let him take which road he pleaSed. He went gently up the hill that leads to

fiastically ridiculous, and will not de-

reasonable, and returned to this place
in a state of mind not to be defcrib-

not let him call any one up; So

They have none of them Seen you, therefore cannot judge of your worth. Hht why do I dwell on my own Sufferings ? Perhaps, in my abfence, you may be forced to a marriage with him, whoSe name I cannot write—my whole frame trembles at the bare idea.
Will you not chear the days of abfence with a line : I know, the delicacy of your difposstion may revolt at writing to me, but Surely you are above Such trifles, and will not render the man you have honoured with your affedions miserable for mere

Though I do not doubt your constancy, 1 well know the refpest you pay to your father ; and that the duty of a daughter is a first principle. The propriety of your conduct I ever did admire, nor would I lessen, in the Smallest degree, your attention to the best of parents ; yet, in this instance, I could wiSh him leSs fevere, or my fortune more favourable. I Shall wait at this place until 1 have a line in anSwer to this incoherent letter, which I Send by a fellow who knows Agnes, and who will watch an opportunity of giving it to her.
The poor girl met me as I crossed the court last night in my way to the Stable. I involuntarily Said, God bleSs

Lord, Sir, Said
she, for certain you are not going away at this time of night! Does Mifs Laura know of it—I ran from her, not being able to reply. By her question I know Ihe has observed my partiality; and the natural goodnefs of her heart, which I have Seen evinced in an hundred namelefs astions fince I have been at the Grove, convinces me that I may trust her. Can you condefcend fo far as to relieve my mind by a. line in anfwer ? which is become more neceffary. Since the Secret of my birth has been diSclofed, and that not in the most favourable light.

Caftle, Brighton,
heaverrs Sake-let the indoSed be Sent diredly to Portman Square! 1 hope no buSy body has been writing to Lady JarSey that I am at this place. Her last letter was written in a manner which Serves to awaken Sufpicion in me. Do you know, Edmund, that She threatened me wusth a jaunt to Brighton, if I did not come diredUy to her. This is
petticoat government with a vengeance. This won’t do, my Lady ! You must stay where you

vastly difficult for me to be extricated, becauSe I do not by any means
wifii it.

Lady Sufan, my boy, loves me ; and will, I believe, at my earnest Solicitation, elope v/ith me.-^Don’t Say a word. She is all life and Soul; just what Jemima was j and not what Jemima ts—my wife.
I dare fay that my affedlions for Lady SuSan will not last for life, and then, you know, I stiall be a reformed rake ; a charaDer that is always Said to make the best hushand. Good
or bad afterwards, 1 must enjoy the preSent moment.
Lady
140 THE LABYRINTHS OF LIFE.
Lady SuSan is So conSoundedly jealous of Lady JerSey, that I hardly
dare mention her name in her prefence.
Women are fools ! they do not know their own interests; they should

not get hushands in Siich haste, it is lovers they want: nothing is So truly ridiculous in the preSent days as a fellow in love with his own wife.
To Speak the truth of us, we are as accommodating to the fashion as we can be. You know that I always hate to be out of the ion.
Charles has had a letter from old
I

I find your friend, poor Neville,
has got into a Scrape at the Grove.

I am Sorry for it; for 1 like him much. There is a modest dignity in his air that imprefles one greatly in his favour. 1 wish he had a fortune fufficient to enable him to marry Laura Vernon ; although I don’t know if this would tend to his hap-pinefs.
The old Squire has written a letter reproaching Charles for introducing Neville into the family; interfperfed with Sentiments not of the most liberal nature. Charles was shocked at thefe, and is greatly hurt at the
manner in which Mr. Vernon treated Theodore, on his discovering their pnehant for each other. If his Father does not behave to the girl better than he did to her lover, Charles fvvears that he could find in his heart to affist him in running away with
her,
142
THE LABYRINTHS OF LIFE,
her, did he not know that Neville would ruin hiinSelf by taking Such a step. He has not yet written a line to Charles on the Subjedl. Perhaps he thinks he is to adopt his Father’s
reSentments.
Mr
his Father, I SuppoSe, but they are of very different diSpofitions.
I believe you never Saw Lady SuSan Strangeways, I will therefore endeavour to give you a description oS her perSon. She is of the middle fize, has a proSuSion of auburn hair, large hazel eyes, which she never fails to uSe to the best advantage; a Grecian noSe, and the finest Set of teeth that you ever beheld ; and a pair of lips that is imposhble to defcribe ; her neck and shoulders are alfo undefcrib-ably beautiful.—I shall not fay any thing of the rest of her perfon, for
I am
THE LABYRINTHS OF LIFE.
143

1 am but bad at description ; befides, itis impoffible to paint heaven: I hate an unSucceSsSul attempt at any thing. There is a delicious languor that Sometimes prevades her whole frame. The fummit of delight is reServed for the man she favours; and that I am in expectation oS being, that I am certain you do not doubt.
I hope, however, Lady JerSey is not acquainted with my being here, iirting with the lovely SuSan, as her gentle nerves might be Shocked at fuch an impropriety, and I should have an hundred Sermonizing letters from Lady Wentworth, 6cc.
Charles thinks of returning to the Grove next week, in order to pleaSe the old Gentleman, which I am forry Sor.—A man in love, yoii know,
wants
144 labyrinths of life.
wants no better company in the absence of his mistreSs than his own thoughts.

If, when the darling maid is gone. Thou doll: not ligh to be alone,
And mufe and fold thy languid arms, Feeding thy fancy on her charms ; Oh never dream again that thou Haft lov’d—for love is nourifti’d fo.”
TheSe lines are the produdfion of a very accomplished woman. They are truly feminine. We men never give ourSelves half the trouble to demonstrate our pastion. If thofe which she points out are the true fymptoms of love, there would not be above one man in love-in a thoufand years : Nor, as I believe, who could fay with truth, they were exadtly de-fcriptive of his feelings. I am a mad

Sit down to write to my Sister, unable to give her the least conSola-tion. What were your feelings on reading the dreadful paragraph, 1 can eaSily conceive. I am (hocked- at the condudl of Sir William. Poor inSatuated man ! how will he one day Suffer for this attachment ? I had thoughts of writing to Lady Sufan
Strangeways, and endeavouring to convince her of the impropriety of her condud:: but, on restedion, I
gave up the intention j as a mind

capable of forming Such a connec-
tion.would be callous to every. Senti
ment of justice or humanity. To
write to Sir William would be equal-
ly vain. If your letters do not rouSe
him from this lethargy, mine would
be dilregarded. I think you Should
let him know that you are acquainted
where he now is. Tell him direct
ly, as it happened, how this came to
your knowledge. The part you
have to act neither admits of, or
needs deception. Do not cast him
from you with reproaches, as this
may render his return to rectitude
difficult, and therefore diScourage
him from making the attempt. I
greatly fear for your health in this
conflict. Let religion and fortitude
Support you. I do not think Sir
William

Our Mother is Somewhat better than when you leSt her. The (lightest intimation oSyour unhappy fitua-tion would destroy every flattering proSpect of her restoration to health.
I enquired of MiSs Vernons, who called here yesterday, where their brother was. Laura replied, in London, with Sir William JerSey. Is he removed from thence ? Indeed that may be the reaSon why we have not heard from Charles lately. I Said, I understood that Sir William was at Brighthelmstone, but might be mistaken. Poor Laura—She is not happiy. My Mother entreated them to dine with us, as we were intirely

Laura Said, she would gladly accept the offer iS Emma would return to dine with her Father, as he might be uneaSy at their stay, not knowing that they intended a vifit to us. Accordingly Emma returned home. BeSore dinner Laura and I took a turn in the Garden; where, with tears, she diScloSed to me the fitua-tion of her heart, and ashed my advice. Indeed it was impoffible to adviSe her; the caSe is hard: yet Mr. Vernon is not to be blamed, except for the Severity in which he wrote to Mr. Neville. Poor Laura’s affections are placed on this young man, who has at preSent no fortune but his commiffion ; and he is alSo particularly unfortunate, you know, in regard to his birth.

This day fortnight is destined for her marriage with Sir James de Grey. I do not think Mr. Vernon, on this cccnfion, aDs with that confistency that generally marks his condudl: : for though he might not think Mr Neville a proper perSon for his daughter to marry, yet to force her to accept of Sir James is cruelty towards her, and injustice towards him.
After the cloth was removed, and
the Servants had retired, I afked her
permiffion to conSult my Mother;
who endeavoured to perSuade her that
*
it was her duty to obey her Father, though at the fame time the tear of pity glistened in her eye. She pref-Sed Laura to her boSom at parting, and bid her hope every thing from a good and beneficent Creator, who knows what lot is best for us.

I am quite poetical this morning I think. Faith I am in better Spirits to-day than I have been for Some time past, and I’ll tell you why this is. Lady JerSey and her friends, I

Y O U were forgiven before you afked it.. I. thank, you for your description of your preparation for the maSquerade. I have Seen the Dutchefs in idea, most buiily employed. I know her diSpofition well, and that this entertainment is at prefent a-
mongst the most Serious concerns She has in this world.
I arrived here on Tuefday last, and
found Laura much altered as to looks, though better in Spirits, than I,
who know her diSpofition, at first
K 6	thought
204 the labyrinths of life.
I
thought possible. Mr. Vernon received me with that kindneSs and hoSpitality he is So well known to possSeSs. Emma looked all life. The approach of a wedding is always pleafing to young people, for they do not know how Soon it may be their own lot to get a hushand. wiSh Sir James had fixed on Emma, as She is a very amiable girl, and has no prediledfion in favour of any other man. He is, I think, almost a fault-lefs young man : and that is making a prodigy of him. I know that she cannot be happy with Laura, should he by any accident hear that her affections were placed on another per-fon; for he is paticularly nice in his Sentiments with regard to our Sex, You will wonder perhaps how I came to be fo well acc]^uainted with his

diSpofition. Fie travelled with St. Auban, and lived much in our family after their return, until my brother grew too dissipated, and then the acquaintance was broken offi. I Saw Sir James here yesterday morning
he begged to be confidered as one of my old friends, and faid that my preSent vifit was a favour himfelf as well as to Mifs Vernon.
He drew me assde, whilst the ladies
♦
were bussed in giving Some orders, and faid, Lady Anne, do you not think me very fortunate, confidering the life of dissipation that I led in town, to have made choice of So ex-cellent a woman as your fair friend ? I am under inssnite obligations to you for your good opinion of me, for
Emma told me you had written To her Sister, and had not forgotten an
2	old

old acquaintance. He talked much oS his approaching happineSs, more I fear than he will meet with in reality.
I have endeavoured to convince Laura that she ought to confider this union as a bleffins; rather than a misfor-
o
tune, but I have a powerSul opponent to contend with in her inclination in favour oS Neville., She Lever men-
tions his name without tears.
Lash
night she configned his piDure, which she had drawn herSelf, to my care, faying, that though she herSelf mush be for ever wretched, she wished not to render another So, and
r
therefore, that it was proper to put the picture out of her own poffeshon.
I much wonder Sir James has not discovered her reluctance towards an union with him, as she fays she has.

frequently burst into tears in his prefence, and been obliged to quit the room. He must aScribe that to delicacy, or Surely he would never marry without Some explanation from
cither her father or herSelf.
Mr.
Vernon makes up to Sir James in attention for the want of it in his daughter.
Laura’s fortune is to be five thousand pounds, which Sir James has defired may be expended in whatever (he chuSes to adorn her perSon, The diamonds that were hi mother’s have been new Set, and are very hand-fome; theSe however fhe looks on with indifference. I have infisted that She Shall not appear So melah-cholly before Sir James, as fhe must marry him. Though he takes no notice now, yet if this Should continue
after

after they are united,, he vtfill then be Gurious to find out the-cauSe : and, if Gonnedted with her preSent ShyneSs, it may lead him to think she had formed Some previous attachment... This would be fatal indeed to their future peace, which I most fistcerely
wish to be preServed.. I have done:
(
all in my power to enliven them fince-my arrival, and have put mySelf into a; tliouSand different shapes.,
I do not know but the old Gentleman and I shall make a match of it: . we have fiirted,, a good deal,, which fometimes ends in marriage, I have threatened Charles with becoming his mother-inHaw : he only laughs at me, and fays, he would marry me himSelf rather than let his father

She was very inquifi-

pofiible, to go to the Farm, observing that her preSence might be of Service, as there is Something conSo-latory in the company of any one in whom we place a confidence. In Such a state as her’s the mind is apt to be unsteady, and is therefore glad to rest on the opinion of one whoSe cooler judgment may best adviSe, Why am 1, who am So unfit for this purpoSe, placed amidst all this miSery.^ MiSs Wentworth appears to be greatly affected by her Sister’s cala-
mity
She is perfectly astonished.
as indeed every one elSe is, at the unaccountable conduct of Sir William. She thinks if Lady JerSey does but preServe her health, he may be brought, by expostulation, to See his errror, and endeavour, by a different conduct, to make atone* ment. I am of another opinion quite.
With
but not altogether a bad one.
THE labyrinths OF LIFE. 211
With Some diSpofitions this might have effeD, but not with any So light and volatile as his.
I told MiSs Wentworth the plan
\
that I had laid down for Lady Jerfey. She Seemed to think it dangerous,
I wish
she may perSuade her Sister to try it.
You do not know how happy it would make me, as I am almost certain of SucceSs.
I shall write to you again from Truro in Cornwall, as Sir James has a Seat near that town. We are to go there immediately after the ceremony, which is to be performed on Thursday next at the Grove. I think this happens very well, as a change of place and different objedls may ashst Laura in reconciling herSelf to her new fituation. She is pleaSed herSelf

at removing from a Scene that brings daily to her remembrance an objedt that must, if poffible, be forgotten.
Sir James is here very frequently, and endeavours to amufe us a thou-Sand different ways. We were yef-
terday evening agreeably furprifed one our return from Lady Wentworth’s to find a very fine band of mufic
concealed in the wood. Thefe people are engaged to attend us into Cora--wall, as the houfe is Situated on the point oS a rock that hangs over the. Sea, and the mufic, I dare Say, will have a fine effect.

It is only fix days fince I wrote

On Wednesday morning Sir James de Grey rode over to the Grove, accompanied by a Mr. Davenport, who was his particular friend, and who
came
THE LABYRINTHS OF LIFE. 215
came by invitation to be preSent at his nuptials. They Spent the remainder of the day with us, only retiring as Soon as tea was over, in order to give us leiSure to prepare for the next day’s journey,
Laura behaved with furprifing fortitude, although 1 could fee the starting tear force its passage down her cheek many times, when (he thought herfelf unobferved. Sir James was all Spirits: his mind was wrapped in the most perfe<st calm. He Seemed to contemplate his future happinefs j and the expression of his countenance was perfect harmony. After he was gone, Mr. Vernon retired to his library ; Emma to prepare for packing up her clothes ; I to give Some orders to my maid 5 and Laura to her -dressing-room, where stie defired to

V
Elm-walk towards, the Shrubbery, As I had finished my bufineSs with WilSon, I followed her. After, a long Search I came to the hermitage, by the fide of which She was on her knees. I immediately struck into a-nother part, not wishing to obtrude on her retirement. She had Seen me and followed, her eyes streaming with tears. How good. Lady Anne, are you to Seek a wretch, who is endeavouring to hide even from herSelf, You have been witneSs to my weak-iieSs. I have been embracing my favourite myrtle. It was planted by a hand dearer than my own. It will droop when I am gone ; no one will
take that care of it that I have done,

its foot have 1 been imploring astil-tance of the Supreme difpoSer of events, to enable me to adt with becoming propriety. I have Sacrificed every thing to fulfil the duty of a daughter, and I would not be found deficient in my conduD as a wife.
I' Sat down and endavoured to comfort her with every argument in my power. She assured me that thofe
were the last tears She v/ould shed.
We walked towards the houSe, and were joined by Mr. Vernon, who
looked earnestly at his daughter, and then Said, Laura, my dear, you have been weeping ! I am Sorry to See this. You think me cruel: I hope you will not continue long under that idea. Lady Anne, Said he, it was impoffible to let my daughter maiTy VOL. I.	L	a beggar I

a beggar; an unknown perSon : one that, however good in himSelf, might by his connections have brought difi» grace on my family, which has remained unSpotted through a courfe of nhore than four hundred years.
The Gentleman whom I have provided as an hushand for her is, of all others, the most calculated to render her happy, and whofe family would add lustre to the brightest fituation. Here Laura interrupted him by faying, if, Sir, I have given you any uneafinefs, forgive your child; She is refigned to your wishes, and will never, by any conduct of her*s, disgrace the family to whom she is going to be allied, or that from which she Sprung. Her father preffed her to his boSom, into which she shed a torrent of tears. He bid her go and

compoSe herSelf, and he would meet us in halS an hour at Supper; then greatly agitated left us.
Nothing but family pride, of which he pofirefiSes a very confiderable share, could urge him to this Sacrifice of his daughter’s affedfions. We met at Supper, made a very short meal, at which, I will venture to fay, none of us were Satisfied, and retired early. I flept with Laura, or to Speak more properly, I Spent the night in her chamber for we were not in bed more than two hours before Agnes came to call her mistrefs. I love this girl, she is So affedionate. So much inter-rested in every thing that concerns the family in the Smallest degree, that it would be impoffible to treat her as a common Servant. But to my story. We arofe, and notwitstanding the

fatigue of mind she had undergone, Laura looked extr-emely lovely when dreffed, She wore a very pale Sappho blue filk great coat with elegant pearl buUons, a white filk ridinc hat, ad-

orned with an elegant plume of feathers. It is needlefs to give you a description of Emma’s drefs or mine, we made ourSelves look as well as we could. We were just assembled in the breakfast room, when Sir James and his friend arrived. He was in an undreSs frock of pearl coloured cloth, looked very well, and was in the highest Spirits I rallied him on our waiting breakfast, to which we had Scarcely Sat down before the clergyman arrived. The fight of
this perSon absolutely frightened me, although he has one of the best countenances I ever beheld. He brought

not poffible, as She was engaged at home with company.
ASter breakfast we all repaired to the drawing-room, where the indif-foluble knot was tied. I kept my eye on my friend during the whole ceremony, as did her Father alfo; She behaved with a calm resignation. When her Father faluted her after
the ceremony, She trembled So much
%
that I thought she would have fainted, but a flood of tears came to her relief. This was attibuted to weak
nerves.


I hurried

THE LABYRINTHS OF LIFE.
I hurried the Servants as much as
\
poffible in tying the trunks on the
carriages, that we might get away from this Scene. There was hardly a door betwixt the drawing-room and that of the hall at which a Servant was not weeping, in order to get a glimpSe of their mistreSs as she paSied. The old grey-headed butler stood in the parlour, when I came down. Well, my Lady, Said he, pray excuSe me, how is my young mistreSs } her Mother was not married in Such a way j—heaven bleSs her, and Send she may one day find that comfort in the match she So much needs at preSent. I affured him I joined in that prayer.

The wind was blowing hard, and as Sir James’s houSe is fituated on the edge oS a rock which projects into the Sea, we were preSented with a grand, rather than a pleafing proS-pect. When we retired after dinner, we went to the drawing-room win^ dow, in order to contemplate the Scene beSore us, which every instant grew more trernendous. The wind was whistling and Screaming through every part oS the manfion, as iS it had been inhabited by perturbed fpirits.
Lady de Grey took an uncommon interest in the hurricane. It brought to her mind an object who must, at that time, be on the boSom oS the

It was a very large Ship. We distinctly heard the firing of their guns. Lady de Grey was in an agony, it had Such an effect on her Spirits.
“ Will not thoSe men lend the poor creatures Some assistance ? Said She. Oh, pray. Sir James, uSe your influence to prevail on them.** He promised her to fay all in his power,
nay, to offer five pounds to each man, if necessary, who would lend his af-fistance. Mr Davenport went down with him, in order to uSe every argument in his power. When they were gone, Laura took me by the hand, and Said, “ Oh you know not the dreadful apprehenfions that pof-fefs my mind.’* I begged her to retire with Emma, who was almost as ill as herfelf, adding, that I would bring her word the moment the Ship

They had just raiSed the young

to fpeak or think what was best to be done.
They carried Laura up stairs, and I involuntarily followed. When we came to the room in which we had left Emma, who was unable to ac-company us down, tears came to my relief, and I related to her the wonderful difcovery, which almost reduced her to the state of her fister.

When Lady de Grey recovered from her Sainting fit, (he went into violent hysterics,, in which She con^ tinned for Some time. At length I entreated her to go to bed, and endeavour to compoSe herSelf before Sir James returned, who was every instant expetsted. This she.promiSed, and only begged me to See that the unfortunate Neville should have possible affistance.
Emma went with her fister, and I, as I had promiSed, went to See what was doing below stairs. On my entering the room, one of the gentlemen begged, that if I was known to Mr. Neville, I would not at preSent let him See me. I astured him that I was a perfect stranger. I found by this, that Agnes had told this gentleman how we were all fituated, and
that

that he had taken me for Lady dc Grey.
Mr. Neville was greatly recovered; So much So as to know his com-panions. They told me it was with the utmost hazard that he had been preserved } That getting down the fide of the ship, he had misted the boat fide and had actually funk under her. He enquired anxioufly where he was, and was told, on the coast of Cornwall. I took one of the gentle-menafide,and enquired, if bethought any accident could have happened to prevent the other boats from returning, He thought that, the storm having Subfidcd, w’e might expect them instantly. The Same motive, he observed, that induced Sir James to put to Sea, might detain hirn a little longer.

The moon was just fifing, and from the window we discovered the veffels at a Small distance. Good God! Said Major Grenville (that being the name of the gentleman to whom I was Speaking) what can we do with Neville ? he must not stay here! To know where he is, at the preSent moment, would throw him into Such distreSs as might endanger his liSe.
Mr. Neville, who was looking at the pidure of Sir James, which hung over the door, begged Major Grenville to come near him. For heavens Sake, Said he, enquire whether that is the pidure oS the owner of this houSe ? Is that the lady oS the houSe } Pray anSwer me quickly : my SenSes are bewildered, and I would Sain

told him, that he understood that it was the owner oS the houSe whoSe pidure he Saw. He covered his face with both his hands claSped, he took them away, and then looked attentively at me. I ordered the Servants to leave the room, fearing lest in his delirium he might diScover a truth best concealed. When they were gone, I drew nearer to him than before, and begged him to recollect and compofe himSelf, hoping he would Soon recover from the accident. Oh, Madam, Said he, you are mistaken if you think I wish to live ! Death, in any shape, would be preferable to my preSent' fituation. I have one request to make, for which I may be thought impertinent: may I be permitted to enquire your name? Be afi'ured this request arifes not from

any idle curiofity—Here he waited
anxioully my reply.. Westbury, Sir,
*
is my name, with which, I think, you are not unacquainted. Heavenly powers ! am I under the Same rooS.
Grenville, let us go—I would Suffer any death, rather than continue longer in this houSe. Why, criiel friends, did you preServe me When to have let me perifh would have been Such an act of mercy. Forgive me. Lady Anne, you know my fituation, and can feel Sor it. I dare not afk any questions: your preSence at this place anSwers them all. I will go instantly, ere Sir James returns. I could not See him exulting in his happier destiny.
We thought it adviSeable that he Should be removed to the next town, which was only about a mile
from
THE LABYRINTHS OF LIFE.
13
from the Hall. A carriage had been Sent for to remove fome of the gentlemen, who, as they had been informed of this being the day of Sir James’s marriage, wished not to intrude further on his hofpitality.
^	I
That circumstance was luckily concealed from poor Neville, lie being in a state of inSenfibility at the dime the other gentlemen heard it, and
they, in pity to his feelings, had fince been filent. After they had taken fome refreshment, the carriages being come, they affisted Mr, Neville, who was yet extremely weak, into one of them. He was Scarcely alive, but preffed my hand to his lips, and could hardly articulate ten thouSand thanks. They drove off.
I then turned my thoughts on my friends above stairs. • Just as I approached
14 the labyrinths of life,
proached their chamber door, the bell at the gate was rung with great violence. I returned to the parlour in order to receive Sir James. Mr. Davenport entered ; his Sace pale as death. For God’s Sake, Sir, what is the matter Where is Sir James ? He flung himSelS in a chair and covered his Sace with his handkerchief. 1 went out of the room, not being able to wait the coming of the Servants. The housekeeper met me. Oh my Lady, what will become of our poor Lady ? Why, where is Sir James, Said 11 Oh he ventured too rashly—he is drowned. I do not think the instant stroke of death could give me a greater shock. As Soon as I had power, I returned to Mr. Davenport, who Said, pray ex-cuSe me, I really had not the power

of Utterance when I first entered: where is Lady de Grey ? how shall we impart the dreadful story to her ? I Said, that the fatigue of mind she had undergone during the storm had been too much for her Spirits, and that I had prevailed on her to try and compoSe herSelf.
I entreated him to give me an account of the dreadful accident. He Said, that the boat that they were in approached the wreck as near as they could, in order to pick up the drowning wretches who were floating on the waves; that just as they were about to return, the body of a man almost quite exhausted was thrown by a wave nearly into the boat. It Sunk down but came up again, when Sir James, who stood near the edge, leaned over the fide, and got hold of

the hand, as we SuppoSe, of the drowning man, when, in an instant, a Squall of wind nearly overSet us, and threw my poor friend overboard; nor could we ever, fee the least fign of him afterwards. The poor creature, as we imagine, was at that moment finking, and Sir James, we think, unfortunately took hold of him, and that he had never let go his graSp, but dragged him down with him. We have been thefe two hours endeavouring to find the body, but to no purpoSe. I hardly knew how to
return. Never, Surely, was Such nuptials as theSe. I would freely have given all I posteffed to have Saved my friend. A poor Sailor stripped instantly, and jumped into the water, but to no purpoSe. He

Swam about until he was nearly dead before he again reached us.
Lady de Grey rung her bell. I begged that none of the Servants might inform her of the melancholy event. I did not wish to inform Mr. Davenport of the Scene to which she had already been witnefs, but thought it best to mention to him, that Lady de Grey had been greatly shocked by Seeing Some oS the ship’s crew who were brought in almost dead, and that I feared this Second
shock would overpower her quite.

We agreed to fend an exprefs. to Mr. Vernon immediately, requesting him to come diredtly to us. This I left Mr. Davenport to do, whilst I went to my friends. Every Servant was in tears; my own eyes were in the fame condition. The instant I

law Laura she aSked, where is Sir James ? Surely he is returned before this time. I cannot fee him, indeed I cannot, in the state of mind in which I am at prefent. I did not anSwer her, for indeed I knew not how. Agnes, who stood by the bed-stde, fobbed aloud. Gracious Good! is that unfortunate youth dead ? he is,—I am fure he is.—But, Neville, although I am now the wife of another, I will not linger long behind thee. That God who permitted our Separation, can at his pleafure distolve this union, and unite us in death. I astured her that she was wrong in her conjecture; that Mr. Neville
was So much recovered as to be re-

moved in a carriage to Truro, at his own request. Did he know that I
was here did Sir James fee him ?
what

what does he think of my not joining the company ? Do not afk me, my dear, Said I, the events of this day have rendered me unable to anfwer fo many questions. It is now near midnight, and it is fit you should
endeavour to compofe your mind to rest.
I hoped that before she should a-wake in the morning Mr. Vernon would arrive, and that he would break the dreadful catastrophe to her. I ordered Agnes to fit up with her Lady, but on no account to im-part to her the death of Sir James.
I cannot account for my being able to Support mySelf through theSe misfortunes, So well as I have done.

So anxious was he to go out and examine round the coast iS the mercileSs waves should have cast.the corpSe of his friend on shore : and alSo to wait the arrival' of Mr. Vernon, who, we calculated, might arrive by eight in the morning. I arofe at Seven, and fat trembling every instant lest Lady de Grey should be stirring, as she is
naturally an early riSer.
Whilst I was waiting, Mr. Davenport returned, but without any tid-

He had Sent out boats with a
promife of a very large reward, if they should find the body. We fat in filent expectation. At length, about half past eight, Mr. Vernon*s chaiSe drove up. I was unable to stir. Mr. Davenport went to receive

Does Sir James know that Mr. Neville was here ? 1 Said, you cannot gueSs to whom I have just been giving breakfast.

She was let blood, which gave her the power of breathing. We put her to bed, and the Surgeon defired she
might be kept perfe<stly quiet, and, that we should anSwer as few questions as poffible. This was done without her uttering a fingle word,

I do not think Lady de Grey will remain long here, when She is able to be removed. She has continued in a deep melancholy ever fince She was made acquainted with the dreadful fate of Sir James, which is now three days. Mr. Davenport left us this morning. Charles Vernon came here the day after his Father. Indeed I Shall be glad when I again reach my home.

Oh, I had like to have forgot that the Surgeon who came to See Lady de Grey told me, that Mr. Neville could not be prevailed on to stop at Truro one night, but proceeded directly to Portsmouth, where he Said there was another vestel, in which he might be yet in time to embark for Gibraltar. The Surgeon pronounced him stark mad. Poor wretch! I should not wonder if he were So in reality.

Lady de Grey, for whoSe misfortune we are most truly Sorry. I greatly fear she will hardly be able to Sustain the shock Sir James’s untimely death must occaSion. Should the SubjedI not be too painful, Lady JerSey and my Self would thank you to write us; the circumstances of that dreadful day. As there are numerou we cannot rely on any as true

Indeed Emma, I have a tafk almost as hard and as painful as yours to perform. It is to fit by the couch of an amiable lister, whole heart is nearly broken by Sir William’s de-fertion. To add to our grief, Ihe is
declared to be pregnant: a circumstance that would, twelvemonths ago, have rendered her fupremely happy, as it would alfo have done that perfidious man, who now openly lives in defiance of all Sentiments of juf-
tice and honour. Our mother has

broke it to her aS eafily as poffible.

Mr. Vernon being with you, wc proceeded on our way to the Farm,‘where we arrived the next day to dinner. My
Sister was then very ill in bed. It is impostible to defcribe the meeting between Lady Wentworth and her. It was all that the tenderest affection could Suggest.
We were greatly Shocked to fee what ravages grief had made in fo Short a time on the features of Jemima. She strove to look chearful, in order to calm the grief of Lady Wentworth, which it was impostible

This was done yesterday, and we anxiousty wait its return. Surely he will hasten to his injured wife, and, by a different conduct, induce her to forget her past mifery in her future happineSs.

You defired to know what I hear of Sir William JerSey. I will tell you, with this caution, that I am relating from mere hereSay, and therefore may be guilty of the fault I have just condemned ; though I know you will acquit me of the fame malignity. It was Said at Lady Lucan’s route, last night, that Sir William had gone off with Lady SuSan Strangeways to France, from Brighthelmstone ; and that Lady Harriet had conSented to accompany her lister. I can hardly believe the latter part of the intelligence ; as I cannot fuppofe Lady Harriet, without attachment. So dif-folutc as to countenance her Sister’s infamy. However, this is affirmed
for truth. Their relations are greatly incenfed at their unprincipled conduct.

Poor Lady JerSey I I long to hear bow she Supports the misfortune. Every one pities her, and execrates the wretch who could injure her.
I fuppofe you will be on the wing for the Castle foon, as you imagine that Lady de Grey will not continue long where she now refides. Your Brother is paying his addreffes to Lady Lucy Fenton, I am told, and will marry her, it is faid, out of fpite. She will never trouble him with theatricals, for it is with the greatest , difficulty that she is able to Speak. Her frame is too delicate for walk-'

Truro Point,
OUR kind letter, my dear friend,
arrived late last night. I take the
earliest opportunity to thank you for
it, and to Say that my Sister is ex-
tremely ill. Her Spirits have re-
ceived a shock, from which I fear it
will be very long before she recovers.
Morning Herald of the 2oth (which
I have not the least doubt but you
have read) for an account of the un-
happy accident, as every circumstance
is there related as exadlly as it is poS-
fible for me to do, in our prefent

lituation.

-
have i^ever been able to fihd' the body of Sir James, which afflidis us all extremely. My Sister has offered large Sums of money, to induce the fishermen to uSe their best endeavours, but thefe have proved, as yet, ineffectual.
I read your letter to Lady de Grey, who was much affected at its contents, and defired me to fay to Lady
JerSey, that her first vifit, when she
went abroad, should be made to the Farm. My Father is for our removing to the Grove directly as Clifford-
t
Place is fo hear, and, as he thinks, that Laura will regain her health and fpirits by changing the Scene, better
than by remaining in a place which

cannot fail of preSenting horrid im-
ages to her imagination.
V
Lady Anne Westbury has been
with us, and contributed all in her
power towards my Sister’s recovery.
Indeed had she not been here, I must
have funk under the fatigue of fpirits
I underwent. Our Father is greatly
j
and fometimes, when a little peevish,'
blames us for fustering him to quit
the houSe in Such a storm. For my
own part, I was So frightened, that
I did not know that he was gone,
until Lady Anne, growing alarmed
for his fafety, informed me of it.
Laura has never left her room
fince she was first informed of Sir
James’s death : nor will she ever go
into that part of the houfe that fronts
the Sea, She Says, the fight of the
fpot

THE LABYRINTHS OF LIFE. 53
Spot where the accident happened, She believes, would deprive her of her reaSon.
The title and eScate devolves on'a first coufin, a young man, who was before rather in indigent circumstances. He has written a letter of condolence to my Sister, defiring that she will not hasten her departure Trom Cornwall, to him; Clifford-Place, with the houSe in town,-to my Sister. My Father wrote the anSwer, as Laura was too ill, thanking him for his attention to Lady de Grey, but that she could not think of staying longer here than her health made absolutely necestary, and would inform Sir George the instant she quitted it, which would be in about four or five days. I therefore make no doubt but

Poor Lady JerSey ! Surely, by this time. Sir William is with you. He cannot hear of her preSent fituation, and alSo of her Sufferings on his account, unmoved. Lady Wentworth should go to Brighton, and expostulate with Mrs. AnSon on the extraordinary behaviour of her Niece, and
represent how much
JerSey
Suffers by her imprudence. This, I think, could not fail of having Some effe<£t, as, after this, his vifits could not be admitted. You must excuSe my giving advice where Lady Wentworth is; but my good wishes for Lady JerSey’s peace prompt me to Suggest a hint, which I fincerely hope is, before this time, rendered uSeleSs by the preSence of Sir William.

I know Laura is Superior to theSe ideas; and I alSo know how much she Sacrificed to duty, ever to think she would give her hand, were I mean enough to request: it, in direct op-pofition to her Father. I must de-Serve the blesting before I afk it, Vernon. My Spirit, though it cannot boast an illustrious line of ancestry, is as proud as though I had been descended from a CaeSar.
That your Sister has an affection for me, is the only gleam of comfort

I felt mySelS as having been in Some degree accessary to the unfortunate fate of Sir James, who, but for his fatal partiality for me, had still been alive.

ND So you tell me, St. Aubau will marry out of Spite! ’Tis but a bad Scheme. Lady Lucy Fenton is exaOIy what you deScribe. She W’ould make a very pretty pidlure, but a very bad wife. As to my doing the honours of the houfe, after St. Auban marries, that is impoflible. Whenever that event takes place, I

Lady

Lady JerSey a vifit. We were all greatly shocked to See this amiable Sufferer.—A Settled melancholy Seems to have taken poffeffion of her fine features. She was pleaSed to See Laura* They both wept much at their meeting, and were Some minutes before either could Speak.

I learned from MiSs Wentworth, who, with her Mother, still continues at the Farm, that Sir William
/
is gone, as you informed me, to Paris, and paid not the least regard to a letter written to him by Lady Wtent-worth. Unprincipled wretch ! I have not common patience with him. Lady JerSey is very far advanced in her pregnancy. Mifs Wentworth told me, that she very feldom Speaks of Sir William. This, she thinks, she avoids, in order to render her. Mother eafier in her mind ; but it is plain that his bafe conduct preys on her vitals.

ought. Our minds were originally intended to be free; not fubjed to the controul of any fecond' perSon. Advice and reafoning are the privilege of a parent; but by no means compulfion, which never fueceeds.
Lady de Grey determines never again to enter into the marriage state, but devote the remainder of her days to religion and acsts of charity. Mr, Vernon, I know, has exacted a pro* mife from her, that She will never think of a fecond hushand without consulting him on the Subjedf. I do not think I should be very Scrupulous in this particular. Neville has

I understand Charles Vernon is going to join the profligate party at Paris, at which I am greatly astonished. I always confidered him as
a young man poffefled of Sentiment, and am very Sorry to find mySelf deceived. Lady de Grey means Se-rioufly to Speak to her Brother before he departs for the Continent. She thinks thofe that countenance Sir William are hardly Second in guilt

Jerfey is a very plea-fant fellow, and I like his fociety. If you would all let him alone, he would fall into the right path of himSelf; but he will not be driven: of this I am certain. And if this were practicable, I am not the man to attempt it.

You must excuSe me for not being
a very punctual correspondent: my health of late has not permitted me to follow my inclinations. Had I been well, I should not have remained So long in town j the ties of early friendship would have made me attend Neville to Portsmouth. I hope this voyage of his will alter the Se* verity of his fate, and that before his return it will affume a milder
form. I do think his breast is the
/
feat of every manly virtue ! I would

freely give half my estate to See his parents restored to him, and himSelf happy. I am afraid they are dead, or they vrould certainly have appeared to claim Such a Son. Any man
f
might be proud of the relationship, as I am certain he never has, nor ever will, derogate from the character of the man of honour.
I am extremely angry with Charles Vernon. Was it proper to adop6 his Father’s pride So far, as to let Neville depart in filence from this country ? No ! he should have been above Such Selfish ideas. Had I had a fister, and Neville had gained her affections, he should have married her with my full approbation; not that this was in Vernon’s power, as his Father was living ; but he might,, by attention to this unfortunate

is a report in town that her Ladyship is pregnant. I hope that this is not true, or iS it is, that you will confider the bufineSs, in which you are now engaged, as a mere frolic, and that you will directly return and Solicit her forgiveneSs. If you

particularly anxious to make known that he could give her. Mr. AnderSon waited upon her Father, and declared himSelf the lover of Mifs ; upon which, her Father approving of him for a Son-in-law, they entered upon particulars like men of bufi-nefs. Mr. AnderSon wished to have five thouSand pounds more in addition to the fortune, which caufed a demur of three cr four days, the Father perfisting in not parting with a farthing more.

you that yesterday morning she was

brought to bed of a Son : but 1 must alSo inform you, that the joy of this event is greatly damped by its being the opinion of every one, that it is very doubtful whether either Jemima or the child can Survive.
The birth of a Son has rather

made an addition to her Sorrow. She weeps inceffantly over the infant,

and calls on its cruel father to protect it when fhe (hall be no more; until all preSent are dissolved in tears, The child has had very strong con-vulfions, and it is feared will go off in one. With the child all our hopes of reclaiming Sir William would be gone.
My Mother is confined to her room. The agitation oS both body and mind is too much for her.
The attendance on my Sister muft excuSe the fhortnefs of my letter. The next I hope will convey more favourable intelligence.

MY LADY,
It is with the deepest Sorrow I obey the orders of Lady Wentworth, who
Set off for her estate in Yorkshire
%
this morning, that I inform your Ladyship of the death of my .most amiable Lady and Child, which happened within two hours of each other. She gave orders, the day before her deceafe, that she should be buried in the vault belonging to the family, at Harewood, and that the funeral should be performed by torch-light, Some time betweeen

the hours oS ten and twelve at night. She Said, poor dear Lady, that she choSe that time, as it would prevent So great a concourSe of people, and consequently the indignation which might be raifed against Sir William’s conduct. As she forgave him, she
hoped that God and all the world would do the fame.
What will become of that unfortunate gentleman, when he comes to hear of the death of So good a Lady 1
I hope your Ladyship will excuSe my taking the liberty of writing So familiarly.
MiSs Wentworth deli red me to fay, that as foon as her grief was abated, she would write, but that,

Lady and MiSs Wentworth are gone to an estate of her Ladyship’s, in a distant part of Yorkshire, in order, no doubt, to avoid Seeing the place where j>oor Jemima has dclired to be buried.
The news Spread over the village
last night, as I Sent directly to the Grove, to acquaint my Father of the melancholy event. Every eye this morning is drowned in tears. As Lady JerSey was a friend to the poor, they cannot fail to revere her memory.
How uncertain are the events of this life ! Who would have thought that Jemima Wentworth, the life and Soul of every Society, only four years ago, should be now lying a lifeleSs corpSe ; her death occafioned by the perfidy of the man .who, at

destroyed, when it is too late to
make reparation. Instead of being
an object of pity, he will be held ia

detestation by the rest of mankind, as well as the woman whofe infamy has occafioned all this miSery.
Poor Lady Wentworth! my heart bleeds when I think of her Sufferings. To hang over the bed of a dying' Child, to So affectionate a Mother, was too Severe a trial for human nature to Support. That Being who caufes Such Sufferings,
can best heal the wound.

the back rooms. This I refuSed, having determined to devote the remainder oS this day to the indulgence of grief. The Sound of the bell, that had tolled all day, at each stroke Seemed to remind us of dur Jemima.
About nine in the evening, the village and cottages around were pouring forth their inhabitants, not with that rude and tumultuous noiSe whith which the meaner clafs generally affemble, but with decency and order. Every little groupe were relating Some . good deed done by her
whom they now mourned.

About a quarter of a mile from this place, they had to pafs through the corner of a wood, where I first observed the melancholy procession,

After the funeral v/as over, Mr. Arnold, according to promife, called on Maria. He faid, he had never experienced So hard a talk as that he had just gone through; for, befides the reSpedt, and almost fatherly affedlion, which he Selt for Jemima, he had been greatly moved by the Sudden burst of grief which proceeded from, all pre-

I believe you are not likely to See yoiir Brother very Soon. As a corref* pondent of mine informs me, he is at Paris, with Lady Harriet Strange-ways, whole chains he at preSent wears., I am Sorry to give you intelligence, as the object of his attention I hold,in the utmost abhorrence, thinking no one in existence worSe than herSelf, except her Sister,
Lady SuSan.
Into what difficulties may the Marquis not be plunged by this connexion ? The preSent fituation of

paths of vice, the wretch still finks

How will that man ever be able to face the world ? But, what is still worSe, how will he bear the stings his own conscience will repeatedly, give him ? Will not the amiable qualities of the injured Jemima riSe in dreadful contrast to the infamy of the woman whom he has preferred to her, when fhe shall leave him a prey to defpair!
I am informed that his affairs are not in , the most promifing state which leads me to think, his prefent dream of happincfs will foon have an end. Lady Sufan will not be found Sufficiently attached to stand the test of poverty.
You will fee that I am in a very grave mood, by my writings but

I have many thanks to give you for your last* Your city neighbours afforded me a very hearty laugh, as I

I (hall expect, with impatience, your description of the race ball. What a pity that the Marquis does not arrive time enough to dance with

It was a letter from Lady Wentworth, announcing to him the birth of a Son, and at the Same time the death of both the child and its un-happy mother, written in the most pathetic language,. He tore the letter out of my hand, read over and over its contents, then threw himfelf on the ground in an agony of grief,

It was impostible to offer confolation in a cafe like his; Lady Sufan, notwithstanding her fe-vere indifpofition, on hearing the news which had been carried to her by the officious fervants, came dowm to the room in which were Sir William and

Her face, at the news of
Lady JerSey’s death, feemed lighted up with the glow of fatisfadfion. Sir William quitted the roond on her entrance. She defired that I would shew her Lady Wentworth’s letter. After reading it with great unconcern she returned it to me, faying, I don’t See why her Ladyship should write fo

Severely to Sir William, Lady JerSey is not the first woman who has died in child-bed. What could he have done had he been in town ?—What might have been done if Sir William had been in town, I cannot fay; but, as things have turned out, it was rather unfortunate that he was not there. I can only fay that the world has lost a most deferving woman. She turned, upon her heel without making any reply, and left the room in purfuit, I fuppofe, of Jerfey, who had stmt himfelf up in his chamber and would not admit any perfon.. About three hours after, I Sent up word to him that I was just going to Laufanne, if he had any commistion that I could execute..

am fortunate enough to have captivated the heir of this illustrious fa mily, and may hope, in my time, to receive the compliments of the citizens, on being arrived at the dignity of Lady MayoreSs.
In my last, I mentioned that we were intending to make them a vifit the next morning. About twelve o’clock, my Mother and Father, and myfelf, Set out to pay this vifit, from which we expected no Small diver-lion. We were all of us drcsted as plain as quakers.
As our coach drove up the avenue at Egginton^Hall, we obferved a

footman standing on the steps of the' hall door, from which he. ran into the houSe, to announce our approach. When the coach stopped, out came Mr. AnderSon and his Son, who handed us from the carriage. The young man eScorted us into the houSe, while the Father almost Shook the hand of the Duke out of joint, in welcoming him to Egginton. On our entrance into the drawing-room, Mr. AnderSon preSented us to his Lady, who, with her two daughters, one on each fide, stood at the door to receive us, and re-echoed the words of their Mamma, that “ they were proud of the honour of Seeing
us.

No doubt, Said Mrs. AnderSon, it must be mighty dull for your Grace, when this here Mall was empty, as I have been told you was very great with Sir Harry’s family when they lived here. The DucheSs replied, that she had never been at the Abbey fince the death of Lady Horton.

Above

From theSe I turned to the family themfelves, who were dreffed for a fide-box rather than a morning vifit. Mrs. AnderSon wore a gold muflin, trimmed with poppy-coloured Satin j at the edge of which was-a very fine point lace; Her neck and face vied
with the trimming for pre-eminence of colour. Over the former was a.
handkerchief of joined blond, and.

Indeed her fize is almost absolutely necestary, as Ihe carries her whole family about her own perSon. Her hushand and Son adorned her arms, which looked, from their rofy colour, as if fire had worn over them a pair of pink gloves. The pictures of the young ladies were hanging pendant from the chain of a gold watch, which was the fize of a common deSert plate, with the addition of half a dozen Seals, befides other trinkets.
MiSs Jane and MiSs Agnes were dreffed exactly alike, to the very
placing of a pin, in blue Satin polo-neSes, trimmed with straw-coloured
ribbands;

ribbands; and they wore white Sattin Sashes, tamboured with gold flowers. They are both very clumSy in their make, which, of all other dreffes, a polonefe shews to the greatest diSad-■ vantage. Their caps were compoSed, like their Mother’s, of a profufion of blond lace, with the addition of Some artificial flowers.
The Gentlemen were drested more in the preSent mode; only that Master Dicky’s perfon was Set off with a white Satin waistcoat, bound with gold lace, for which article this family Seem to have a prodigious pastion. The Father wore a SnuIF-

Pray, Mamma, don’t fend me down flairs any more to ash her for any thing. Never mind her. Child, Said her mother, she will not hurt you, and if God pleaSes, we may go from hence in a few days.

My curiofity was greatly raiSed with regard to the stranger, who, in her preSent fituation, certainly claimed attention, let her former conduct have been ever So reprehenfible. I determined to go the next morning, notwithstanding what She Said against it; which 1 believed rather proceeded from modesty, than any diSlike to my visit.
About ten o’clock, I put on my walking bonnet, and took a Servant to carry Such things as I knew She

The foot-curtains of the bed were open, oppofite the door, and prefen ted to my view a form, as far as I could judge, the most beautiful that could be imagined, and a face that was Scarcely earthly.

She raiSed herSelf on her knees, as if by inspiration, for she was too weak to have attempted it five minutes before, and prayed that the God of mercy might shower down bleffings on my head, and returned thanks for having been placed in a fituation where her mind was relieved with regard to her infant. That now she should die in peace. The Child, on this, gave a voilent Scream, and flew to the bed, on which her Mother had Sunk, and clung round her neck, crying, Oh she is gone away! Speak to me.

14 THE LABYRINTHS OF LIFE,
MISS WENTWORTH
T O
LADY DE GREY,
V
Have taken up my pen, to enquire aSter the health oS my friend the first leiSure moment I found; for my Mother was taken extremely ill directly on our arrival here, and for feme weeks her life was defpaired of; but at length fhe is out of danger, and, I hope, in a fair way of recovery.
You know not how I regret our Separation, and the painful caufe of our leaving Harewood. This place is equally beautiful, but I cannot
bring
\
THE LABYRINTHS OF LIFE.
2IC
bring mySelf to look upon it -as a home. Every thing, and every body is new to'mer but novelty has not charms to make me forget my old friends. Born and’educated at Hare-wood, every one feemed to be related to me, I took an interest in the fate and fortune of the meanest cottager. This I cannot bring my-felf to do here, where all are strangers.
We are fituated in a very good neighbourhood, where every one is
studious to cultivate our acquaint-
ance. My
as yet
has precluded our receiving vifits, or paying them. Indeed, when stie recovers, it is not her defign to mix much in fociety: her fpirits will not bear it; they have received a shock which they will never recover.
You
2i6 the labyrinths of life.
f
You will greatly oblige me, when you writCi to me, if you will make enquiry after that wretched man. Sir William Jerfey, and give us an account what he is now doing, and where he is. My Mother fays, that fhe cannot forget that he once be-
O
longed to her family, however he has forfeited his right to be confider-ed as a fon; yet fhe pities him, as he will one day feel feverely for his past atrocious conduct toward a most amiable and blameleSs woman.
We'would like to know every circumstance about him, and of this you may be able to give us information, your brother Charles being at Laufanne, when the expreSs arrived with the melancholy news of our Jemima’s death. Do not fear to
shock
THE LABYRINTHS OF LIFE, 217
V.
shock us with the recital oS his behaviour on the occasson, for w’e cannot, expect him to adl whth. more propriety now that he is at liberty, than she did wshen under thoSe powerful restraints, honour and justice.
I hope your Ladyship has recot^ered your health, and that Mr. Vernon and Emma continue theirs. Surely you do not intend to Spend the winter in the country.
Lady Wentworth defires me to fay, that you ought to go to London, for though your preSent widowhood will preclude you from mixing in all the diverfions of the place, yet the Scene before you v/ill be lively.
We
shall

OUR letter gave me inexpreffible pleaSure, as it informed me of your Safe arrival, and alSo of your being in perfedl health. I undertake to put you in Spirits—no more whining, Neville,—I won’t allow of it. You are destined to be a very happy fellow : that I can forefee. Now for your mistreSs, which is the first con-stderation with you, I know. She is just what you left her—a widow; nor do I hear of any one who has formed a defign todiSpute your right

to her heart. She is coming to town next vvTek. This fn telligence will, I well know, raiSe your apprehenfions. Don’t you know that when a woman has once lost her heart, she will paSs through a whole herd of beaus as
O
a flock of
V as if they were
ey
sheep ? Now, I believe, you are in
of the heart of Lady de ti and I last night heard So charm-ing a charadler of her, that I believe her to be poflefSed-of that unfafiiion-able virtue, constancy.
I am Sure you will be Sorry to hear that Lady JerSey is dead. Her death was occasioned by the horrible and detestable condust of Sir William. Sle broke the heart of that amiable creature, to get pofl'effion of that of
Lady SuSan Strangeways, which is a mere piece of stint in comparison.

She is a mere coquette, and lives but for adoration; ‘for the first fellow who has a finer fortune, or pays her a better turned compliment, will Sh leave JerSey, I am certain. This treatment he deServes, and that he will meet with it I have not a doubt.
The Marquis of Arrandale is flirting away at Paris with Lady Harriet
Strangeways, the
Jerfey
flame. I once entertained thoughts of paying my addreffes there, but am now truly thankful for my deliver*-
ence.
I hear that JerSey ferioufly defigns to marry Lady SuSan. This would be a completion of all his follies; but I yet hope that this is not true.
t
You enquire of me if I know Lady Anne Westbury. I am not very

She mar-
Lord
Irr

ried to pleaSe her Father. Westbury was a man whom it impoffible to deScribe ; he never did either a good or bad adlion, but just ftiffered himSelS to vegetate, and then died ; which last aO, I dare Say, Lady Anne was not Sorry for. She was only married eight months, and has been a widow near two years; during which time, she has been aS-failed by innumerable Suitors, but has not favoured any with her hand. She was not in town at all daring the last winter, which cauSed a great deal of conjecture amongst the great world. Some SuppoSed that she had
'	met
\

met with a disappointment oS the
heart y others, that She had a rustic lover I neither oS-which I believe to be the real cauSe of her Ladyship’s Seclufion ; for, fincc you wTOte to me on the Subjedf of Major Grenville’s attachment, 1 have been very inquifitive about every thing that concerns her, inSomuch, that I am Set down by the tabbies as having defig ns upon her my Self. She is extremely gay and Sprightly, but by no means a coquette; she is posteffed of an excellent understanding, and
therefore Scorns So deSpicable a cha-rader.
1 have now, I think, given you all the news I can muster, of our friends, and think it time to fay little about mySelf.

When you leSt England, I was in a very valetudinary state, from which I am now tolerably recovered, to the great joy of my excellent Mother; for, "faith, Theodore, I believe she is the only female who has a thought about me; but I can asture you, that I cannot Say the Same thing of her, for there is one whom I could prefer to all her Sex, provided she entertained the fame Sentiment towards me, I am too proud to hazard a refuSal. The next winter, therefore, must determine whether I
shall be So happy as to gain the miS-trcSs, of whom I aSpire to the pof-feffion.
She is no mean beauty, I promiSe you, and is Daughter to the Duke of Mortimer. I don’t believe you
ever Saw Lady Madelina Mortimer.

If ever you did, I can hardly believe you can forget her.
Yo a fee I am approaching by rapid strides towards your heroics, Neville ! Love does perform miracles, I have been told.
If Lady Madelina is heart-whole when (he returns-to town, for She is now in Derbyshire with the fa-

to Lady LaScelles on your return, and wshilst you are employed in diminishing his Majesty’s Subjects, I shall uSe my best endeavours, towards replenishing the stock.

We are juft arrived at home after the difiipation of a race-week at Derby. All the etiquette of precedence, on thoSe important occafions have been most: rigoroufly obServed, to the no Small mortification of ou’^ city friends, .
VOL. III.	B	I have
2 the labyrinths of life.
I have to thank you Sor two letters I Sound on my return, and to entreat they may be followed by a third, as Soon as you can make it convenient. I am much interested in the fate of
the Stranger, whofe recovery I hope to hear is no longer doubtful. How fortunate v/as Ihe to be placed So near you, whofe heart and purSe are ever open to the unhappy. The poor infant !—I Shed tears over her artleSs
*
forrow ; and execrated the mercilefs wretch, who could treat a fellow creature in distrefs fo cruelly. Should the Lady not recover, we will provide for the Child arhongst us.
Your friend, Lady de Grey, is, I hear, arrived fafe in town, and looks divinely:—So faid a gentleman whom I met at Derby.
I Slidl
THE LABYRINTHS OF LIFE. 3
I Shall give you an account how we Spent the week, as well as my memory will allow.
ASter dinner, on Monday, we Set out for Derby, and arrived there in about two hours, after a very plea-fant ride. It grew dark before we reached the town. Vv^e were greatly alarmed by anoife of different voices hallooing from a carriage, which paffed us very rapidly. My Mother called one of the fervants, to know whether any accident had happened. He anfwered, that it was only Mr. Anderfon’s carriage that paffed, and that they called out to us. I am certain the voices of the whole family must have been joined, to make
fuch a roar as assailed our ears.
/
When we arrived at our lodgings,

our SuroriSe, to find Mr.
derSon’s coach at the door. This did not last long, Sor Mr. AnderSon came up to the carriage, and Said, “ You
See, my Lord Duke, how werry cleverly I contrived it. Y'ou did not expect we should be Such near neighbours. My girls are quite delighted. I never told them a word of it, till we came to the town end.”
My Father could not conceive what he meant, as he had engaged the whole houSe, and yet their trunks were carrying into it. My Father applied to the man of whom he had taken the houSe, to know what was the reaSoh that it was let to any other perSon. He anSwered, that this was not the caSe; but that there was a houSe at the bottom oS the yard,
which

which Mr. AnderSon had taken, and that, as we were not arrived, they had carried their luggage through our houSe. This relieved us from our
embarraffment, and we alighted. I went up stairs to deliver Some jewels
V
oS my Mother’s to her woman, who had been at Derby the day before, to See that the houSe was well aired, &c. She Said, was not your Lady-Ship Surprised to find Mr. AnderSon’s family at the door ? Yes, replied I, how came this to happen, for 1 do not yet rightly understand it ? Why, replied Morton, Mr. AnderSon came one day last week to Derby, in order to Secure lodgings; and, after feeing all that were vacant, and disapproving of all, he came to this houSe, which he was informed was engaged
B 3	for
/
6
THE LABYRINTHS-OF LIFE
for the Duke. Now, I am right, Said he, I thought I should find it out at lash Pray, has your next door neighbour a houSe to let ? Mr. Davis informed him, that there was neither a houSe nor lodging in the street vacant, but that there was a little houSe at the bottom of his yard, if that would Serve the family. This Mr. AnderSon Saw, and approved of, as his Servants could lodge at an inn: for, he Said, he had determined to lodge near the Duke, as the fiimilies v/ere So fond of each other, and, he did not doubt, would be related before the next races.—So you See I am provided for.
On Tuefday morning, Mrs. An-derfon Sent enquiries after our healths, and to lay, that she would pay us an
half-
THE labyrinths OF LIFE.

balS-hour’s vifit, if we were unengaged. We readily accepted the offer, for on the first race morning there was no public breakSast, and we did not know how to kill the time, until we went to the courSe.
The houSe they occupied was very Small, and the windows were So placed, that it appeared like a lantern. It was impoliible for them to stir without our Seeing them. The whole family was in motion. The three ladies all dressed in one room, and the oppofite one was occupied by the gentlemen.
As Soon as they were dressed, they all came in a body to pay their compliments. Mrs. AnderSon Said, that (he was vast glad to be
lodged So near us, as She hoped to
B 4

THE LABYRINTHS OF LIFE.
live in a Samily way, as friends. Ay,
_ »
my Lord, Said Mr. AnderSon, we can entertain a Sriend or two, though we have a little houSe. I have laid in a good stock of provifions : your Grace would be SurpriSed to See my larder. Tis full of the best, and at the Service of my friends.
My Mother could not refrain from
laughing, for he Spoke of his larder with Such glee, that one would have
thought that he had come to Derby merely for the purpoSe of eating and drinking.
Oh fye, Papa, Said Mifs Agnes, don’t entertain the DucheSs in that manner. And why not, replied he ? I’m Sure I brought as fine a buck to Derby as e’er a man in the country, and his Grace Shall be a judge; for
I pre-

I presented it to the stewards, and we Shall taste it to*morrow. . IS your Grace fits near me at table, I’ll engage to give you Such Burgundy, you can’t get at this here place, for
I have brought my own wine.
My Father anSwered with a bow.
y

and I began to enquire oS the ladies,
how they had Settled the point as to their head-drestes, which was quite undecided at our last meeting. Mrs. AnderSon told me, that my opinion
*• V
was always decifive, and that, therefore, powder had beenSJdetermined upon.
j
Master Dicky Said, that he wished
he had been a female, in order to
/
have the privilege of conSulting me as to dreSs. Oh, replied his Father, Dick, you have a good enough taste
B5
of
10
THE LABYRINTHS OF LIFE
of your own. Every one Said that you was the nlost genteelest drest at the Lady MayoreSs’s last Easter ball. How does your Grace think he did it.? Why, on the Queen’s birth-day, he Sent a man to the door of a certain great perSonage, to enquire for his
Gentleman, and Said, that there was
«
a perfon who admired his HighneSs’s clothes So much, that five guineas were at his Service, only for a direction to his taylor ; which was agreed to be given immediately. The five guineas was given in exchange, and at last Dick had like to have been taken in, for the taylor lived at Paris, But I indulged the rogue: a fine Suiii it cost me.
Well, Said his Mother, I am fure he looked just like a perfon of quality
when
THE LABYRINTHS OF LIFE.
I I
when he was dreffed :—was not he
%
taken Sor the Son of the Spanish am-balTador ? My Mother Said, she
-thought there was an air of falliion ran through the family ; with which compliment they were So delighted, that they took their leave, in order to contemplate their own con Sequence.
I intended to have given you an account of our week’s diverfion in this letter, but I find that quite im-poliible, as I am but just got through the occurrences of the first morning. I will, to-morrow, refume the pen.
I beg you not to forget to write to me, as I am anxious to hear the .Stranger’s story.

Yours,
MADELINA MORTIMEF.

my Mother, in order to finish my promised journal. ,
At the proper time, we Set out to the courfe, which we had not been more than once round, before the AnderSons appeared, in all the fplen-

looked like the Sull moon.
The
Servants were all in new liveries. The postilions jackets were the most ridiculous things you ever Saw. The body was green, striped down the Seams with yellow lace, and the fleeves were yellow entirely, with the addition of a cuff oS a mixture oS theSe colours. They had the effedt Sor. which they were defigned, which was, to attract attention. No one pasted without enquiring who they

, by the people as they paSFed. Some Said they wereoutlandish folk; others, that it was a man that made a great
O-
fortune by conjuring at London, one Katterfelto.
We had Some compaffion on them, and ordered the carriage to draw up
cloSe to their’s; for my Father
%
thought that they might be infulted by the mob, as Mrs. AnderSon was giving herSelf Some city airs, and ordering her Servants to keep off the vulgar wretches; which might not
have been relished by the honest
/
rustics, who had Surrounded them out of mere curiofity, and which
their own outre figures had occafion-ed.

thought they might have been more polite to strangers than to Sneer and laugh at them, and cut their unmannerly jokes to their faces.
We reconciled her to her fituation by Saying, it was imputable to their
ignorance ; that their appearance was
So Superb, that they had been Surprised into ill manners. My Father Said, that he never took any other than an old carriage to Such diver-fions, there being very little reSpect to perSons paid, as liquor was a
grand leveller of distinctions.
After we left them, they ordered the head of the carriage to be put up, and we obferved them making violent complaints, when joined by

In the evening, at the ball, they were all over-dreffed, and Seemed hardly able to move. There was gauze upon blond, and blond upon gauze. Master Dicky looked like the figure oS the monkey who had Seen the world, in Gay’s Fables. I really pitied them, for I need not tell you what a country race-ball confists of.
They were the conversation of every one preSent; and, as all eyes were on them, unlefs vanity came to their affistance, they must have had a very unpleaSant evening.
They declined dancing minuets the first night; but the Second outdid any description that I am capable

pable oS. I question whether Bun-bury himSelS is equal to the talk. It happened, very fortunately for them, that their partners were equally auk-ward with themSelves. The laugh, therefore, that was impossible to be restrained, was imputed to the gentlemen dancers, by Mr. and Mrs. An-derSon, whoSe anger had been excited by their daughters having not been SeleDed as partners for fome of the young men of fashion prefent; and it was nearly the last minuet before Mifs AnderSon was taken out by the booby fon of an ESquire. Mamma Said, her daughter had danced with nobility before she came to Derby; for Lord Kilcoobery’s eldest Son danced with her at Lady MayoreSs’s
route.

I had thought it pofiible to give you a week’s account of our proceedings, which I now find impoflible: However, Suffice it for the prefent, that, before I returned, I had So far completed my conquest, that Mr. AnderSon made propofals to the Duke ; which, in point of fortune.

very advantageous. My
gave for arifwer, that he valued my peace too highly to interfere, until my partiality rendered it necestary t that he did not doubt but the merit of Mr. AnderSon would not be unattended to on my part; and that be Should be happy if it produced, ia my breast, the defired effect.
My Father well knew it was im-postible for me to think of a union with this lump of stupidity, or he
would
THE LABYRINTHS OF LIFE. ig
would not, I am convinced, have returned So Savourable an anSwer.
I wish I could diffemble, that is to Say, that I had enough of the coquette in ray diSpofition, to teize the Duke for his joke, and make him believe that I am really enamoured of this city Swain. I well know his pride would revolt at an union with this ridiculous family, only he wishes to amuSe my Mother with them, in order to render her stay in the country tolerable.
The creature had the affurance to ash me to dance with him, the last night of the ball at Derby. He was continually at my elbow. The last morning, at the public breakfast, he was So officious to hand me a cup of tea, that he Spilt the whole into the
lap

lap of the Dowager Lady M——, who did not Spare Some Severe Sar-caSms on the occafion.
The whole family left the room, and the town alSo, in a huff, about half an hour after ; and, I dare fay, will never attend any public meeting there again.
In short it was determined amofigst most of the best families, who met at the race, to shew them a marked
indifference, in order to drivQ them

from the county, as they did not like any upstart to get footing amongst them. My Father greatly disapproved of this proceeding, as Mr.
A
AnderSon, he Said, was a good inof-fenfive man : and that, as a neighbour, however he might laugh in
private at his ignorance, he would,

by no means, join in showing him any marked incivility. Indeed, con-fidering that our families are to be unitetI, I cannot but think him in the right.
I Set out with an intention to in-

As to horSe-races, 1 know you have an utter averfion to them, and every Species of gaming you equally detest. My curiofity is truly feminine on this occafion,—So pray have pity.
I had half an hundred questions to have afked cf you. Brought you an

invitation from a Sair Lady, who is a widow, and, consequently, quite in the preSent ton^ To Speak plain: I have accompanied Lady de Grey to town ; who, by the by, I dare fay, had rather have my company than that oS Sir James, had he been living. ■
I long to afk her, iS she remem bers there is Such a being as Neville in existence ? I would not have he? inconstant, as I know that he is deserving oS her ; and, as Semales are rated at preSent, (although my own Sister) I must do her the justice to Say, that she holds a pretty high place in the Scale.
I have been this morning to Port*-man Square, to enquire aSter JerSey, and find that he is one amongst the

Among the judicious and Satherly admonitions which you Srequently gave me, it was one, rather to avoid dishonour, by a punctual and rigid discharge of duty, than to court diS-tindion by running, unneceffarily, into the throat of danger. Feats of chivalry, you obServed, as often lead to detraction and envy, as to reward and honour. The plain and unaS-
fuming, but irreproachable path of a Soldier and gentleman, who does his duty, without affecting distinction, is, in your judgment, the most likely, as the world goes at preSent, to avoid contention, to conciliate friendship, and to obtain preferment. I am more than half perSuaded, indeed, that your way of thinking, on this Subject, is just; but I well know
that
\
♦ <•
•> z- X*— ' fN-

42 THE LABYRINTHS OF LIFE.
that your advice to me was dictated by the most anxious concern for my prosperity and Safety.
A train of accidents, of a most extraordinary nature, that difplays
the intricacies of fate in a most striking manner, and with which you are by this time acquainted, confpired
ft
with the pastion which I have con-fested, to wind up the fenfibility of my foul to the highest pitch of impatience : and I longed for an opportunity of meeting an' honourable death or glorious victory.
, The Spaniards had long carried

on their approaches against Gibraltar, and constructed a strong work without much interruption ; when our most consummate commander. Seizing the proper moment for involving
thousands
THE LABYRINTHS OF LIFE. 43
thoufands in one common ruin with their accumulated labours, determined to make a fortie^ one of the
•%
most defperate manceuvres, I need not inform you, in the whole art of war. As the fucceSs of this bold step depended on the intrepidity with which it should be carried into execution, volunteers alone were employed in the perilous expedition. I shall only fay, that I was of that number, and that my Services, Such as they were, met with the warmest approbation and applauSe of the General.
Another piece of Service was, by and by, to be performed, which required, if poffible, still more determined resolution.
The combined fleets of France and Spain not only blocked up the
Straits
44 the labyrinths of lifh.
Straits of Gibraltar, but Seemed to cover the ocean near as far as Cadiz. The weakened state of the garrifon made it necessary that we should either be re-inforced, or come Soon to terms of capitulation with the eaemy. It was, therefore, of the
last conSequence that an account of our distressful Situation should be conveyed to the English administration.
4
To penetrate through the combined fleeC by force, was impoffible: nothing, therefore, remained for the accomplishment of our objeD, but the way of stratagem. It was determined, that a Small party, with diS-
patches for Lord George G—-------ne,
attired in Spanish dresses, should make their way through the enemies
fleet,

THE LABYRINTHS OF LIFE. 45
fleet, if poffible, in an open boat; and, for the greater Security against Surprise, it was agreed on, that they Should not bend their courSe outward into the Atlantic, but inward to any neutral port in the Mediterranean, from whence the diSpatches, in mul-tiplied copies and directions, might be Sent to England.
The enterprise was big with danger, both, from the natural elements, and from the enemy; for the Small boat was not fit to live in any storm that might arife; and certain destruction, or, at best, captivity and irons, would attend them if they Should be
detected by the French and Spaniards.
General Eliott having astembled the whole of the officers in the for-

treSs,
46 the labyrinths of life,
treSs, explained his defign of Sending diSpatches in this manner, with the circumstances that made it necestary. A Suitable reward, he Said, undoubtedly would, and, if he lived, should be bestowed on any gentleman who should perform, or attempt to perform, fo fignal a piece of Service.
I was not the only one that offered his aid on this occafioni but my offer was accepted. With fix gallant volunteers, accustomed to the oar and helm, and the management of a Small Sail, 1 came Safely through the hostile fleet; and, with a favourable wind, hoped in a short time to gain one or other of the ports of Nice,
Leghorn, or Genoa. We pasted, with the enemy, for a party Sent out
from the admiral’s ship for fresh vegetables and other provistons.
Wc

47
We Set out from Gibraltar about
\ •
ten o’clock in the forenoon, and continued our courfe, under an eafy fail, all that day, as well as the greater part of the night following. But towards the dawning of the next day we were hailed and taken up by an Algerine corfair, who, from our drelTes, mistook us for Spaniards, and carried us prifoners to Algiers.
I found means, by liberal promifes of reward to the Algerine, to fend a letter to the Britisti Vice-conful, to
whom I communicated the whole of
/
the cafe. He reprefented this to the Dey, who, after a delay of fome days,
ordered me and my companions to be releafed, and all necestary provi-fions to be granted for our little veiTel, in cafe we should chufe again

4^ THE LABYRINTHS OF LIFE.
to Set Sail, and to purSue our destination. But I have, with the advice
of Mr. D--------th, judged it more
prudent to Send different copies of the diSpatches by vessels bound to different European ports. In thoSe vessels I have distributed my faithful companions, tvho, I am fure, will never rest till they arrive in London.
I myfelf have taken a passage in a Ihip bound to Naples, being confident that, what with the copies already fent by different routes, and what with thofe I Shall yet fend, the dispatches will, in good time, Safely
reach their destination.
You must understand that it is the custom here, to let out the Service of

There was no Lady : fhe was dead
many years: only Lord R---------and
Ills Son. At thoSe times when the Sa* mily was down in the country, my Father w^as particularly careSul that I
did not CO to the Hall; that, indeed,
did not happen oSten, for my Lord Spent most of his time in London.

Durino; the Summer months, whilSt they were in the country, they generally brought a number of young men of fashion down with them. It hap« pened at oneoS thefe times that I went to the Hall, not knowing that the family was there, to vifit my good «
friend the houfe-keeper ; and was greatly furprifed to find her busted in Setting out an elegant defert. However, I Set to work, in order to help her in the dilpofition of the flowers. I had taken off my hat and gloves, the weather being.remarkably warm, and was standing near a window which was open, when my Lord R— pasted it in his way to the stables. He stopped and looked in as he pasted. I dropped a curtfey, he returned a flight bow and pasted on, but Soon after returned leaning on the arm of

his Son, a fine youth about thirteen.. A young gentleman was with them that I had never Seen before. His
_	f
Lordship called Mrs. Jervis, and ashed her what little beauty she had got with her. She told him who I was: he Said that I must dine with him as he could not think of placing me at the fecond table. My foolish heart was Swelled with vanity. Coronets and coaches danced before my eyes, and I worked myfelf up to that pitch, that I actually believed myfelf already a Lady. Mrs. Jervis was not So well pleafed with my invitation as I was,-That I plainly Saw ; which I Set down to envy in her, instead of the real motive. I fretted myfelf all the morning becauSe I had not drested myfelf to the best advantage, having on only a plain linen gown and black beaver

bat. I had a vast profufion of hair, which hung in natural ringlets about my face and neck. The dinner bell rang, and I went up stairs with the
butler. My Lord met me at the
•*
door of the dining parlour and handed me to a Seat, at the fame time faying, that he would have been happy had my Father beenof the party; but that as it was now too late to alk the favour of his company, another day he hoped to fee us again. I fat covered with blushes, which his Lordship continued to heighten, by praifing my hair, teeth, shape, &c. There were two other gentlemen at the table alfo, one of them was the fame who pasted Mrs. Jervis’s room whilst I was at the window. He was not extremely handfome, but had a most engaging countenance, and the
64 the labyrinths of life,
finest form I ever Saw; he took un-
m
common pains to remove my em-barrast'ment, and paid me a marked and elegant attention. I did not know his name, for he was always addreSfed by the name of Harry.
Well as I had been pleaSed with the idea of dining with his Lordship, I now wished myfelf out of the room, I was going to retire as foon as the defert was removed, but his Lord-ship faid that he would not lofe my company So foon ; for that they did not waste their time in drinking, and that he had ordered a little concert in order to divert me. We do not, faid he, ufe the ceremonies of the town : here we live for ourfelves. Harry do you shew MiSs Fitzalleyne the pidlure you drew of her ; she will, I think, pim-nounce you no mean artist. No, my
Lord,

Lord, Said he, I will not produce So mean a copy whilst I have it in my power to fee the fair original.
Just as he had ended the Sentence, the doors of the Saloon were thrown
t
open, and I heard a very fine concert, which was Sometimes accompanied by the gentlemens voices. After the miiSip was finished, I begged leave to retire, as it grew late, and my Father, I knew, would be uneafy. To this his Lordshio confented, but not until I had promised that my Father should wait on him on the next Sunday to dinner.
I went home with, a heart as light as a feather. I flew to my Father’s studv, told him the honour that had been conferred on me, and the engagement that I had made for him, for the next Sunday. He Said that he

ner, with blue riband. This employment took up all the intermediate fpace between that time and Sunday, His Lordship and family were at church. The vifitor, whom I shall in future call Henry, made me a most refpedlable bow as he pasted my pew, and I observed, that during the Service, he never took his eyes off me. This pleafed me highly, as I had, from the first moment of Seeing him, confidered him as the most elegant man I had ever beheld. After the Service was over, his Lordship went up-to my Father and defired that we would take a feat in his coach;, which he accepted. We were entertained at the Hall with much hofpi-
tality.
After dinner his Lordship

me. I did So; we went up stairs, when she told me that 1 was become a very great favorite of his Lordihip’s, and that perhaps I might be her Lady fome of thefe days. That her orders were to preSent me with a fet of drawers that stood in the room, and alfo with their contents. They contained, she Said, fome of the cloaths of her late Lady, and, as she believed, had never been opened Since her death. I was almost dumb with joy. We opened the drawers, which con-tained a quantity of wearing apparel and fine laces, and many little trinkets. Among the most valuable was the pi6ture-of Henry, wshich I concealed as Soon as I Saw it, fearing that Mrs. Jervis might take it froiH

O
stairs, in order to thank his Lordship for theprefent which he had just made me. On entering the parlour, I was Surprised to find every one gone but Henry, who was fitting writing a letter. I stepped back, intending to go and fit with Mrs. Jervis until the return of his Lordship; which I was prevented from putting in pradfice by Henry’s calling out, “ Do not go away, MiSs Fitzalleyne, I have been left by his Lordship to efcort you into the garden, where your Father and he are gone.” I again reentered the parlour. ‘‘ Surely, Said he, you will not deny me the happineSs of being your attendant.

Not to tire your Ladyship, we continued to meet Secretly for more than two months, when Lord R--------
prepared to leave the country, at the time when Henry aflured me, the defign against me was to be put into practice. Meanwhile I had never gone out alone, except to meet my Lover, for whom I had conceived an everlasting affection.
His Lordship had been frequently
«
at our houSe ; Sent many prefents to my Father of veniSon, game, &c. But I had avoided going tp the Hall as much as poffible.
At length the time arrived, when Henry was to attend his Uncle to town. I grew melancholly, fearing that he would forget me amongst So many beauties that Surrounded him.. He Said and did every thing to quiet

my fears; called me his wife; andfworc that DO authority on earth Should hinder him from making me Such, the instant that it was in his power. We agreed on a place to carry on a correspondence ; and, not without abundance of tears on both fides, parted.
I went home, and w^as taken extremely ill. The next day Lord
R------and Henry came to take leave
of my Father. I was then confined to my bed, and, of courSe, could not take a farewell look at him who was wholly master of my thoughts. In a few wTeks I recovered, and was able to walk out. During my illneSs, I had been obliged to make a confidante of a girl in the village, whom my Father had got to attend on me. She brought me Henry’s letters, and carried my anfwcrs. Thofe were fraught
with
THE LABYRINTHS OF LIFE.
with the utmost tenderneSs ; he continued to call me his wife ; and I had
f
no doubt, but that we Should, one
#
day, be united.
About three months aSter Henry’s departure, my Father had Some bu-SmeSs v/hich called him from home for Some weeks. It was about Christmas. I was fitting in the parlour, accompanied by the little girl who had staid with me fince my illneSs, when a man on horSeback came to the gate; he afked for my Father, but on being told he was from home, he requested that a note which he had in his hand, might be conveyed to me. The contents were as follows :
“ My dearest Emilia, your huS-band is at the door; will you admit him, and conceal him from the eye

of every one. He is wretched, and only you can relieve his woe.

I flew to the gate, and bade him instantly alight. My joy at Seeing him
did not give me time to confider a moment. He Said, that no one must fee him ; when we were alone he would explain himSelf more fully.
1 fent the fervant out of the
way
but was obliged to trust the girl who was constantly my companion.
We got him into the parlour, when he faid. Oh Emilia ! you Sec before you the veriest wretch in nature ; I have ruined mySelf and you for ever. I am come to take an everlasting adieu. Never more will theSe
eyes look delighted on yours.--------
Gracious

Gracious heaven ! Said I, Henry, explain yourSelf, iS you do not wish to See me expire in your preSence: what has beSallen you ? has your Uncle forSaken you .? Speak to me. I am a wretch, an exile, driven
r
from you, from my country—would I could run from mySelf! I am come to take a long and last farewell. I have unfortunately been involved in a duel. It has terminated fatally for my antagonist. I am come now, at the rifk of my life, which is forfeited,, to prefs you, for the last time, to my faithful boSom. Some happier mam is destined to fill thoSe arms. By heavens the very thought distracts^ me ! I cannot bear it.—

his breast. I ran and fnatched it

from his hand, and fell SenSeleSs at »
his feet.
On my recovery, he begged my pardon, Said that he was frantic: not that he minded exile, had I been his wife - and shared it with him. That it was the Separation from me that distra(5ted him. He Said, that he had Sufficient fortune to render us happy in any country, could he . be So fortunate to gain my conSent
to our union. I affured him that
his fituation made no difference in
/
my affection, and that I would Solemnly promise, never to inarry another.
Well then. Said he, to put your affection to the test, will you instantly fly with me. I must be out of the kingdom, if poffible, by to-mor-

I See, Said he, you will not marry an exile ; and, if not, my life is not worth the holding. I will not fly: my life is forfeited, and I will await my doom. Death will come in a milder form, when inflidted by her

that, to convince him of it, I was ready to follow him through the.

Thus I yielded to his Sufferings, v/hat my reaSon would have taught me to Scorn in any other fituation.
He had a chaiSe with his baggage about a mile from our houSe. He Said he would go and bring it to the corner of the lane, as, in his predicament, the fewer people Saw him the better.

turned out, upon further enquiry.
to be without foundation. But Mr.
Raymond has actually received a

As Soon as I was Seated in the
chaiSe, I began to reflect on the impropriety of the step I had taken, but it was now too late to recede. Henry was almost frantic with joy; he Swore to protect me with his liSe, the remainder of which, he faid, Should convince me of his gratitude.
We did not stop until we came to Hull, where I prested Henry to take shipping directly for France. This he refuSed, faying that he would venture -acroSs the country, through bye roads, to Dover, having
appointed
THE LABYRINTHS OF LIFE.

appointed a Servant to meet him there. I was obliged, though reluctantly, to comply.
On our arrival at the last mentioned place, we Sound the Servant waiting, who informed Henry, that the gentleman with whom he Sought was not dead, that he had only faint-, ed from lofs of blood, and that there were great hopes of his recovery.
My joy'at this news was exceffive. I then thought of returning with Henry to my Father, and receiving his fanction to our union. I mentioned this, but was informed that it was impoffible, and that we must go to France, until the gentleman fiiould be out of danger, when we were to return immediately.
We took the first packet that failed, and arrived Safe at Calais. We
had

had no Sooner taken a little reSrefh-ment, than Henry went out, and in leSs than an hour returned, Saying, my charming Emilia, to shew you how grateSul I am for the confidence you have placed in me, I have been to fee if there were any EngliSIi clergyman in the place, who could give a title I am most proud and eager to alTume—that of your hushand. Fortune has favoured my wishes, and 11 have brought the gentleman, who | waits in the next room for your leave ■ to enter. I Said, had we not better I

I did not oppoSe him, as indeed, in my preSent circumstances, the step he propoSed was the most prudent. He introduced the clergyman, who read the ceremony, which I thought united us Sor ever. No one was present but the poor girl who had accompanied me.
As Soon as the clergyman was gone, Henry exprested the utmost joy, and promiSed to be guided by his charming wiSe in his Suture conduct. He Said that it would not be
proper to let Lord R----know of
our union, until his rage was a little abated, which would be exceSfive at finding that I was now totally out of his power for ever.

He always amuSed me with the idea, that we should return to England So SoOn that it was now unnecessSary. He was my oracle, and therefore whatever he Said was decifive.
One morning, after breakfast, he appeared to be particularly thoughtful. I entreated to be made acquainted with the cauSe, as he had just received letters from England.

Although I could not deny the propriety of his argument, yet it did not lessen my feeling for this temporary Separation. I never ceafed weeping whenever I thought oS it.

HENRY TO EMILIA.
London,
MY DEAR GIRL,
I Arrived in town yesterday. As Soon as I was dreffed I went to wait
on my uncle R
, who, I Sound
by my reception, waR acquainted with opr affair. Will you Sorgive when I tell you that I durst not declare to him our marriage, as 1 Sound that he w’as not as yet made acquainted with it ? I Seared lest the effedl of his reSentment might injure our future proSpeCt, had I revealed our union diredlly. This must plead my excuSe. Had I had you by my fide, perhaps I might have been forgiven. Alone I felt rnySelf a coward. I will not relate to you the number of Severe things that his
Lord-
THE labyrinths OF LIFE.
102
Lordship Said to me, but as they were dictated by a regard to my hap-pineSs, that is, to the happineSs of my Emilia, I forgave them all.
I wander about in this great city
as in a deSart. I am difii'atisfied with
>
mySelf, and confec]^uently with all about me. The fight of you would tranquillize my mind, and render London the garden of Eden.
If I meet a well-dreffed woman, I always begin to make comparisons, how much better would my love look in that dreSs, and determine to purchaSe you just Such when you arrive: for I fear I shall be detained
longer than I at first fufpeOed; and I feel it imposhble to exist much longer deprived of your fociety, and the fight of my Sweet little cherub, Harriet.

The death of my Father was what prefented itfelf most for-

Mary faid, that She knew where to find him, that he was once a fervant of her Master’s, and that he had Sent him over to Calais on purpofe to perSon-ate a clergyman, in order to deceive me into a marriage. It was not the first time he had been So employed. What, faid he, did your Mistrefs believe the humbug story of the duel?
Ay, to be Sure, Said I: Why, was it not true—Not one S)dlable. He knew when the old parfon, your MistreSs’s Father, was from home, and So thought that the best way waste take her by Surprife.

HENRY TO EMILIA.
Why will my charming - girl endeavour to make herfclf wretched, when the whole study of my life was, and is, to procure her happineSs ? Surely you are not fo abSurd as to place yours on a black gown, a Sanctified face, and a few words muttered by an old fellow, who perhaps may never fee you again, and certainly never trouble himSelf whether you are miferable or no, for the remainder of your existence.
You afk for the truth.
Love be my excufe, when I confefs, that 1 did make ufe of a little stratagem to enfure myfelf the undoubted
right

right to the heart of my Emilia. She had long been in pofieffion of mine, nor fiball I ever alk it back.
I durst not adlually marry, and I knew that you would shrink from any offer of another kind ; having proved that by the story I told you,r and which love alone fuggestcd, of a defign which my Uncle had conceived of carrying you off. The
horror which you expressed at hearing this, convinced me that any offer of that kind would ruin me for ever. Has any adtion of mine proved to
you that you was deceived } I am not conScious of any; and it must be greatly your own fault if ever you have reaSon to complain of my const udl:. Then, for heaven’s fake, do not let us quarrel about a few idle words, which can never bind the

' The days that we have paffed,were fraught with too much happineSs for us now to wrangle about the means by which it was accomplished. You are the wife of my heart: there your image Sits enshrined. The time may come when it may be in my power to adopt the mode which custom has blished.
X
For your Satisfaction alone I mention this, as it cannot make me love you one jot the more than I do at the prefent moment; when I would give worlds, were I poffested of them, but for a fight of the hem of your gown, or the hand of my dear little Harriet.

How different was this from any of his former letters! It breathed fuch an air of levity as shocked my very foul. I now too plainly Saw my fituation 5 yet could not reSolve to hate him who was the author of my mifery. Some times I reSolved never to See him more, and to put an
end to my life; but the fight of my

dependence

dependence on the Savour of his Uncle ; at whoSe death, I was still willing to hope, that he would marry me in the face of the world*
In the mean time, Secure as I then thought mySelf in his affedfions, I reSoIved to hury myfelf in obfcurity until he Should be at liberty to do me justice. 1 wrote to him, and forgave him : at the fiime time I conjured him not to forfake me and his little one, and that I would Sub-mit to any thing whilst he continued to love me.
At the time he had appointed, the Servant arrived ^tt) condudf me to England. I forgot all my wrongs in the joy bf^mhe more meeting with my hushand, for I could not bring my mind to think that he was not So in reality.

In three drays from our Setting out
I arrived Safe in London, and was
\ •
conduced to a very elegant Small houSe, in one of the new streets at the back of Portman Square. This had been fitted up for niy reception, and no expence Spared to make it convenient: which with Henry’s complaint of want of money, though still it was a proof of his unabated regard for me.
I had not been more than an hour in the houfe, when a loud rap informed me that my Henry was at the door. I flew down stairs, and almost fainted in his arms. He car- I ried me up stairs, and I forgot that ever I had been unhappy, or that ever 1 had been deceived.
- For twelve months I continued in
this houSe. I had numberlefs cauSes

no
of complaint against Henry during this time. I Saw him but Seldom, and that at Short intervals.
One day a gentleman came in a carriage to my door, enquired for me, and ,was Shewn into the parlour. He Said, that he must beg forgive-

neSs Sor his intrufion, but that he
had Something to communicate, that he was aSraid to Speak, unleSs astured oS my SorgiveneSs. I Said it was impossible for me to grant a pardon, unleSs I knew the extent of the. fault. He Said, of that he could not be a judge j, but, as there was nothing Severe in my countenance, he would trust to my lenity. He added, that on the last night he had been in company where my name was mentioned, not in the most reSpeOful manner, which led him to think that
I did

I had let him proceed thus Sar, be-cauSe indignation and grieS prevented me Srom the uSe oSSpeech. As Soon
as I was able, I begged him to leave my houSe instantly, nor ever dare again to inSult me with his company. That if I did not value my Hushand’s liSe, much dearer than my own, he Should not go unpuniOied for this unmanly in Suit.

At the mention of my Hushand, he actually burst out into a violent fit of laughter. Come, come, my lovely woman, faid he, you are too

heard him last night offer you to the first friend who would take you ossS his hands. You, he Said, was too Sentimental, and that he did not want a preceptor. At the Same time
he gave you credit for qualities that stamped him, in my opinion, for the veriest raScal existing, to defert fb much excellence. This, Madam, .was the occafion of my vifit, which perhaps you may reflect on at your leiSure : at preSent I will not intrude. I See that you are too much interested in the villain who has deceived you, to attend to any thing at present.

Every shadow of peace was now fled from my breast for ever. Whilst in postestion of the feeming affedions of Henry, I had even pasted by the shame he had reduced me to; but now I had no doubt but he .hated me, and I had nothing left but grief. How did I then wish for the arms of a fond Father, into which I might fly to hide me from the world, and from even my own thoughts. He was dead, and his death hastened by my disobedience. My mind was wrapped in a labyrinth of complicated wretchednefs, when a rap at the door announced the caufe of all my Sorrow. He came into the room, with the utmost gaiety. What! in tears Emilia, faid he, you will Spoil

y
word I burst into tears. Henry, Said I, you once led me to believe that I was your wife ; have you forgot that you did So, that you dare infult me with any other title ? No, my angel. Said he, I am fpeaking of the conduct of others •; you are totally out of the

It was not necest'ary Sor much argument to convince me of what I most ardently wished to believe, that I had still postestion of the heart of Henry. He promised me to chastiSe the wretch who had dared to preSume to affront me; and it was with the utmost difficulty I could prevail on him not to Send a challenge instantly.
When he left me, I endeavoured to |

You don’t know how happy I was made the next morning, by the arrival of the news-papers, wherein is mentioned the particular manner in which Theodore has fignalized him-Self at Gibraltar; though this was in Some meafure damped by the uncertainty of his fituation at Algiers. I hope you are not still in SuSpence, as I

I Sat down to the breakfast table with the paper in my hand, ready to preSent it to my Father on his coming in. I did So, and fat with the utmost impatience, watching his eye through every line, until he came to that paragraph where Mr. Neville was mentioned; which, when he read, he Said, pstia !—What is that. Sir, Said I ^ Nothing, nothing, replied he. This disappointed me,
b
for I wanted to Set afide his unnatural prejudice against a youth who had never given him the Smallest cauSe of offence.—Did you fee. Sir, how very gallantly Theodore has behaved?
He has profited by the leffons you uSed to give him before he entered

make him in any degree instrumental to the act, he might be brought to applaud the action. Aye, aye. Said he, I See that he has done his duty. Did you ever SuSpect him of cowardice, that you Seem So fur-prifed ?
I Saw that it was impossible to counteract the natural peevissinefs of his difpofition on this Subject : I Say on this Subject, becauSe I never Saw him in my life obstinate but on this one point.
If you are too much engaged to write at preSent, defire Charles to have pity on me, and give me all the news. I (hall long for the return of Spring, as it will be a prelude to the return of my Sister.

If I went to anyplace ten different times, I would come and go by ten different roads : going always the fame way is like a horSe in a mill.

She is almost on the point of ruin, I believe, for she has actually got a kind of a promiSe of marriage out of me. This was done in one of my repentant humours, when I determined to do penance in the shape of an hushand. Now, if the jade keeps me to my word, what’s the odds but I am tired of her in half a year ? ’Faith it “is neceffary that I marry, to keep her within bounds; for she
is as extravagant as Polly M......,
who lives here with the Duke of R——and who trims her carpets and chairs with point lace, and hangs her bells with gold chains.

As Soon as I had read them I returned her the letters which she re-quested to have returned as foon as-read ; at the fame time affuring her that her confidence had not done her the fmallest injury in my opinion ; for that if she would give me leave I would call on her in the morning, in order to conSult with her what could be done towards her future comfort.—I could not unde Tnd, if she had Sold the furniture of her houSe, as she mentioned that she had, how it was poffible she Sliould be at an inn without money; and 1 de-

As Soon as stie could Speak for tears, She Said, “ How Shall I expreSs the

I did not think th^t there was any heart that could pity my Sufferings, which will Soon come to an end.”—Say not So, Madam, replied I, I hope to be able to restore you to health and to happineSs. She shook her head—I then ashed her in whoSe hands she had trusted her money : to which she anSwered, I did not trust it to any one: it is at present in my pocket book.

I then understood, that Mrs. Ben« Son, the woman of the inn, had been deceived into a Suppofition that she had no money, by her Servants having found none in her pockets, and having no idea that she could be possessed of a bank note. I then ad-viSed her not to think oS proceeding into Yorkshire at prefent j but to

I told her that I was the

I had just vowed an eternal enmity to the Sex, and was hardly commonly civil to my brother’s vi-litors: which I fuppofe drove them away at the end of the first week.
During this time I made my daily vifits to the lodge, and was much pleafed to find my patient making Some progrefs towards recovery. At the end of a fortnight She walked half the length of the Shrubbery with me.

When I left the Castle, I had the fatisfadlion to leave Emilia able to walkabout the gardens with her little comforter. Lnever Saw Such attention in So young a child.

the

the tenderest Sentiments. They were founded on mutual esteem, which each day has rather Served to in-creafe than to diminish. Believe me, that the news of his conduct at Gibraltar has given me the greatest joy j which indeed has met with Some alloy, from the fituation into wdfich he is, at preSent, thrown. I had hoped that this news would lead our Father to think more Savourably of him. I have heard him fay, that high birth could not dignify a mean-iiefs ; but that the meanest Subject might be dignified by an illustrious action. He has forgot this Sentiment, I find, in order to Support his family pride, with regard to poor Theodore. I am Sorry to hear his declaration, with regard to his refuSal of his confent to our union,
1v
as

as I would not willingly be a cauSe ()S uneaSineSs to him: I have given Sufficient proof how much I coukl Sacrifice to his quiet, for this Sentiment to be doubted. Whether I Shall continue in the fame opinion, if he perfists in his obstinacy, I cannot yet determine. 1 thank you for the interest you have taken in the feelings of your Sister, and I hope that you will never, for a moment, endure the agony of mincl wliich I have Suffered during the last two years of my life.

If I had been injured' as much as that fanqily has been by his unprincipled conduct, I should rather request of my friends never to repeat his name, than defire to be made acquainted with all his actions. Lady Wentworth I know to be one of the best of women ; and that her anxiety about him proceeds from a good motive, I am certain. Charles is endeavouring to prevail on Sir William to come to England. He thinks it poffible to prevent the match were he in town. I never think of him with any patience; and now that my

Lady Anne Westbury is in town, and contrives to Spend much of her time with me. Her charming Spirits assist in Supporting mine, wshich were never very strong, but are now fo very weak that the Smallest trifle Sets me in agitation. Her Ladyship is on the point of leaving town in a few days, in order to pay a vifit to the Duchefs of Mortimer, whole daughter. Lady Madelina, I very much admire, from the character given of her by Lady Anne. She promifes to make us frieiids on her return,

I ashed Mr. D

He Said, that the gentleman was in the country before he came into it; that he was Said to have performed Some Secret Service, either for the Dey or the Grand Sig-nior, for which he had been loaded with riches, but that he had been obliged to marry a daughter of the Dey’s, who, with her attendants, was Set as a kind of Spy over him; and that it would be instant death for any one to attempt his efcape. The Dey has a Superstitious notion, that

To-morrow evening I go to meet my countryman, and perhaps to find that there is one who has experienced mifery as well as my Self. I am quite anxious to know what has brought and fettled him in this country of tyranny and defpotifm. His heart, I am certain does not beat time to thofe

It is fit that I give you a short account of what has produced this fo fudden change in my diSpofition. You know, I wrote you word that I had given a promiSe of marriage.
I was weak enough to intimate that I wished to return to England, and
that I was ready to fulfil my promife the very next day, or as foon as pof-fible. To this declaration Lady
Sufan made no other reply than Had not you better put your affairs into fome train before you think of marriage. Sir William ? The last remittance Sent by your Steward, and the last he Said that he could Send, is already gone. Gone, replied I! and to whom pray ? I never ordered you to pay it to any one, as far as I

I lost last week—I Sent him what cafh I had in part of payment.—This produced Some very high words between us, when her Lady ship hinted at my conduct to Jemima in So grofs a manner, that I bid her begone out of my fight: which she immediately did, and wrote me word, that she had no intention to marry a beggar, and therefore defired that her baggage might be Sent to the Hotel de B---,

Avignon the next morning.—I ordered my Servants to deliver her boxes as she defired, not fuppofing, however, that she meant to put

I had written a letter requesting her to return in the morning, which, when my Servant went to deliver, he was informed that Lady SuSan was that morning married to Major L----,
----, and that they
had Set off for Paris two hours ago.
I could not Speak for rage for Some time : at last I ordered horfes and
determined to purfue them. Fortunately for me, I began to reflect on the infamy of the woman I had just lost.

Come to Harewood, did your Ladyship fay ? How is that poffible, even astured of your forgiveneSs ? Does not the remains of my Jemima lie there ? Can I look on the fpot that contains a treafure, the lofs of

Arrived at this place late on Sun« day evening,' in high health and Spirits. All the family were in ex-pedlation of me for Some hours, and gave me a most hearty welcome.. Lady Madelina looks as lovely as ever. I have found out a Secret that Ihe would not communicate by letter. This is no other than that Mr. LaS-celles is a declared admirer of her Ladyship.

The country begins to wear rather a melancholy appearance. The leaves

romantic a little like mySelf. I only

I have not yet' been introduced to^ the family at Egginton Hall. They dine here to-morrow, when I expedt to be highly amuSed. The Duke fays, that he has innumerable obligations to them, for that Lady Ma-delina and her Mother would have
found many hoiirs hang heavy on their hands, without the AnderSons Society; and that, consequently, he Should have been requested to Shorten his stay at the Abbey, which would not have been postible for him ta have done; and it would have been a very hard talk for one man to con-

fignifies his penitence now ? Befides, he did not attempt to reform until he could not help it. If Lady SuSan had not found out that his purie lacked gold, he would have continued the Same contemptible wretch to the end of his existence.
I am quite out of patience with Lady Wentworth, for thinking of receiving him again. There is fuch a thing as being too good, I find, though this is the first instance I ever had of it.

Theodore instantly struck my imagination, and I flew down stairs : when, on opening the door, 1 Saw Lady and Mifs Wentworth Supporting our Jemima in their arms.

to wonder how this happened.
It w'as many moments before any one of us fpoke. Lady and MiSs Wentworth Sobbed aloud.

However, we perfuaded her to let Lady Wentworth and Horatia go up with Charles, as, if he had any recollection, the Sudden appearance of her might prove fatal.

It was not poshble for her to prevail on my Mother for a length of time, to act a part in this deception.

To a question, often repeated, whether, befides the note, any other articles had been left with the little orphan ? I at last, conceiving that he meant to enquire only into the amount of my whole stock or fortune, anSwered, nothing but a miniature picture, which my adopting

A Sudden tremor Seized the interesting stranger; and, with a faulter-inj voice, he alked a*fight of that pidlure. I opened my linen waistcoat, and produced a Small filken purfe, cantaining the pidture, with a fmall lock of dark brown hair, which I constantly wore cloSe to my

He kist'ed the lifelefs image of my Mother, (for I now found, for certain, that it was my Mother that She picture indeed reprefented) and, with equal tranfports, throwing his arms around my neck, gave vent to emotions too big for utterance, in a flood of tears.

I was convinced—I felt, indeed, without reasoning, that this was my Father, and abandoned mySelf freely to fimilar emotions and tranSports to thoSe which agitated his breast.
The first thing he informed me of, after his mind had recovered Somewhat of its uSual compoSure, was, that for many years he had been vifited by the exact image that my

W^ITHOUT any preamble whatever, I Send you an abstract of my Father's story.
We are deScended, Theodore, Said he, from the Beaumonts, one of the

not the chiefs of the family, were amongst its most distinguished cadets.

«« My Father, vyho was a clergyman,
destined by my GrandSather to unite

livings in his gift as possible, died young. No other reSource remained to my Mother and myfelf, with my two Sifters, than to accept the aS-iylum, offered to us with a very bad grace, at Raby Caftle. Every expence was grudged—clothes, education—even neceSfary refreshment.
My Mother was degraded into the character of a mere houfe-keeper, and, in fact, no other fervant, in this station, was retained. He compelled my Sifters, his own Nieces, to change their names, and to occupy the places of menial fcirvants.

“ IS another and more honourable lot was intended, by this unnatural

from the Same motive of avarice that had induced him to behave with Such degrading cruelty to my Mother and Sisters.;
“ There lived in a neighbouring manufadturing village, a man of the name of Kemp,, who, by informing against the unfortunate adherents to

in
the
Short reign of James II. and against thoSe of the Pretender, in 1715? and by all the chicane of an attorney,: in the courSe of a long life, had amasted an immenSe fortune.

This Lady, now in her thirtieth year, was destined for the arms of his Nephew, at a period when b« was only eighteen.

mained of the estate, without his participation, with the aid of the attorney, drew up a written obligation, whereby his Nephew, as Soon as he should be put in posteffion of Jane Kemp and her fortune, should devolve the latter into the hands of Lord Raby, for his natural life. This I obstinately refuSed to fign, until threats were uSed to turn my Mother and Sisters out of doors, upon the wide world. I therefore, reflecting, that, although the deed obliged me to give up her fortune, when poflested of it, it neither obliged me to have her or her fortune, conSented and figned it.
“ The respite that this compliance
afforded, from my Uncle’s importu-• * .

were knit in -one, even before we

passion, obfcuring and diminishing
every confideration of prudence into
mere nothing, drew us into the filken
band of Hymeneal union. This
union it was impossible long to con-
ceal.
My Uncle, disappointed of all
his hopes of converting me into an
instrument of wealth, and irritated
by the refledion that the deed was
good for nothing, and that he was
made a general Subjed of laughter,
turned me out of doors with Scarcely

that moment, treated my poor Mother and Sisters with the most cruel brutality. My Mother Soon died of a broken heart. One of my Sisters, in defpair, listened to the addresses of the gardener, and both she and her hushand were forced to quit the fa-^ mily. The fate of the other I .haver

At that time there was a war between the Emperor and the Turks. Bursting Srom the arms oS your Mother, whom I committed to Providence, and with whom I conSoled mySelf with the idea of keeping up a clofe correspondence, I went to Yienna, and offered my Sword to the Imperial General, who was alfo Prime Minister.

It is not in the power of riches tobestow happinefs, though 'the poffeflion of them niaygive it an additional value. I could be content even to labour for the Support of the man I love; and would think a diadem of no value without his participation.”
Lady Wentworth pressed her to

My Father, who is too ill from

Mr Raymond ; of whofe vir-

The
last time, and one of the very few
times that we ever , chanced to meet,
was at Widdrington Hall.
You
may perhaps remember, that, in the
Icourfe of conversation, on the Sub-
ject of the ancient conflicts between
the English and the Scots, to which
we were not unnaturally led in the
houSe of a gentleman, whofe ances-
tors v/ere So much distinguished in
thofe contests; we w^ere drawn on
to make a comparison, or rather con-
trast, between former times, feudal
and warlike, and the prefent, induf-
trious and commercial.
We
THE LABYRINTHS OF LIFE.
We both of us agreed in tb

timent, that there is Something in trade that tends to contract the mind
f
and render it felfilh ; that amidst the contests of hostile tribes, in rude ages, and the pecuniary distrestes that are too often the lot of gentlemen of the army in theSe days, there
is more generofity and honour to be
/
found, than in counting houfes, and shops stuffed with the wealth of the Indies. And we lamented that change in the times which made it
neceffary, in too many instances, for gentlemen to engage their Second Sons in commerce, as well as thofe of the iov/est plebeian, for a provifion in life.

Lord, Sir ! what did they do ; I never heard the story, do tell it. The Ladies too joined in the request to the Marquis to tell the story. He was obliged to conSeSs that he had forgot it. They were not So indulgent to him as he had been to them ; for they Said, of what ufe was it to travel, if you forget what happened when you come home. He only anfwered with a bow.

Spent in Some ridiculous conversation

which could not be accomplished by duty and attention. Think of the conflict under which my mind must have laboured, when I was informed that Sir William was going to be united to the destroyer of my peace. However, that I might not actually be guilty of a crime, I diSpatched a trusty mestenger to Avignon, who could get an account of every step taken by Sir William, and was, if
he still purfued his intention of marrying, to wait upon him, and inform him of all that had past.
I had written a letter to him, at the Same time, telling him, that as I was now dead to the world, and all the comforts it could produce, when deprived of his affections, to shew him how much more I valued his

The Duke of Mortimer is too independent for thefe good-natured people, for he could not confer a greater obligation than to borrow their money.
Richard often tells a story of his being once at a hazard-club, when a poor devil of a Lord was refuSed credit for five pounds, and when the master of the houfe offered to lend

The Father and Son, who descended Srom the next carriage, had on, I really believe, as many clothes

They were much SurpriSed on entering the parlour to find us fitting in morning gowns at breakfast. Why Surely, my Lord, Said Mr. Ander-Son, you are not going to diSappoint us ? why, you are not thinking of travelling ? No indeed, Sir, that I am not, fitid the Duke, it is a Subjest that I by no means like to think upon, except I cannot avoid it. Dear heart, they all repeated, then you wonst go ? Yes, replied the Du-

cKeSs, we only waited your arrival; the carriages v/ill now come round in

Why, I was all day yesterday Seeing the pics and tarts made ready, and making Mr. Ander* Son’s drink. What, Surely, replied
Lady Madclina, you don’t mean to give an entertainment on the road ? No, no, my dear, Said she, but one
is Some times hungry, and a little bit oS tongue or tart is very good; befides we have veniSon and poultry in the Seat of the old coach, as Mr. AnderSon cannot eat the fowls that are fed on dunghills. Well, faid the Duke, I always take theSe things

The carriages coming up^ we Saw the elegant groupe again Seated, and then got into our reSpeDive carriages.. The Duke and DucheSs, Lady Ma-delina and LaScelles, in their post-coach. The Marquis of Arrandalc’ requested a Scat in my post-chaiSe, which was follovv^ed by the domeS-

No, that you won’t. Said Mr. Richard, my Father intends to travel down to Egginton, in the next Summer, at your Grace’s expence. The Duke infisted on paying halS of the bills at least, but was as pofitively refuSed. I have no doubt but they would defray all his ordinary expen-ces, could they contrive to live in his houSe, or even next door, as they did at the races at Derby ; though they would not advance a Single Sixpence to relieve merit in distreSs, or to raiSe genius from obScurity.— Shame on Such charadfers 1 I cannot bear to think that they exist, and that I am of the Same Species.

We pasted on very agreeably and
very quietly until we came to M----
where, at the inn where we alighted, we were furprifed to find every room full, except one that was purpofely reserved for us. They were occupied by Lady Wentworth’s tenants and
old

old penfioners, who had oi;dered a dinner to welcome her Ladyship and to rejoice at the return of Lady JerSey. The instant our carriages stopped, every window was occupied, and thoSe that could not get a place, rushed •into the street. Upon Jemima’s a-iighting from her carriage, they all, as if with one voice, gave three cheers. This grateful mark of kindnefs had So great an effect on LaeT Wentworth, that it was Some minutes be-fore she could get out of the coach. This was intimated to Some who pressed near the door of the carriage, and they instantly went into 'the houSe ; as, alfo, did the honest creatures who were at the windows : So much relpect was paid to this de-fervedly esteemed family*
Aftef

After we had taken Some little refreshment, and were going to proceed on our journey to Harewood, the door was opened, and a venerable woman rushed in and ran to Lady Jerfey, whom she preffed in her arms, crying, Happy, happy ! She could not fay any more for fome time; but.kissSed both the hands of her Ladyship alternately. Mifs Wtent-worth faid, it was the perSon who had nurfed her Ladyship, and whom I foon recollected. She faid, that she hoped the gentlefolks would pardon her, but that she could not wait their arrival at the Hall, when she heard her darling Lady would come and blefs her eyes once more with a fight of her. We all aflured her that we were glad to fee her. Lady Jerfey thanked her for this last mark

Sir William begged our excufe, being but an invalid, and retired. We Spent a very happy evening; after which I returned .with my Father and Emma to the Grove: for he would not let me go to Clifford Place that night, as, he Said, he had Some

triumph that it was proper he should witneSs, it will prevent him, I hope, from, ever again relapfing into liber-

tiniSm ; which, 1 really believe, half
the men of the preSent day enter into

merely becauSe they will not be out oS the falhion. They are aSraid to let any good trait in their charaDers appear, lest they Should be laughed at, and would rather affedt a vice
with which they are unacquainted, than expoSe a virtue which they really posteSs. This is shocking, but 1 believe it to be true.
too, is So much the rage , that you can hardly get a male creature to walk the length oS Hyde
Park, from Piccadilly to Kenfington Gardens, without a je Juts fatigue. One poor thing was, last night, absolutely expiring, occasioned by walking through about twenty chairmen
to call up my Servants. At length, after two or three of us had fanned
*	him,
THE LABYRINTHS OF LIFE. 155
him, he recovered Sufficiently to hand me to my carriage. I should not have minded this affectation, as it is So common, had the man been a delicate looking animal: but he was a perfect Hercules, and might have challenged every one of the chairmen
through whom he had pasted, for bodily strength.
And So, you fay, that you will take no refuSal. I must pofitively come to Clifford Place. Well, to shew you how very good-natured I am, I will do as you defire, after next Monday, the day fixed upon for the celebration of the nuptials of my friend Lady Madelina and Mr. Laf-celles.

Beaumont does me the honour of a call every morning, just that he tnay have an opportunity of talking of you. His Father, whom I greatly admire, is alSo become very lavish in your praife. I think you may take your choice, for both Father and Son are at your Service.

I dined yesterday at the Duke ^
Mortimer’s with the AnderSon Sa-
mily, who are now almost constant
vifitors. Mr. Richard did not shake
one of the party. His Mother Said
he was engaged to attend a club, of
which he had lately had the honour
of being elected a member. On
his appearance in the evening, we

all of us judged that the club was held in bedlam,, or Some Such plac«, for he actually had a fhank-bone of
mutton, striped round with gold leaf, pierced through, and fuSpended from the button-hole of his coat.
r	-	'	'*■
Of this ludicrous appendage he Seemed prodigiousty proud. The Marquis of Arrandale was the first who
took notice of it. Why, Anderfon, Said he, what is this, for heaven’s Sake ? What is it! why, what I intend that you shall have the honour to wear before this day month. Shall I ? replied the Marquis; I am afraid it will cost you Some little
trouble before you accomplish it, though. So it will, Said Richard, and Some little expence too; but hang it, I don’t mind that, when it is to Serve either you or the Duke.
They

They bowed, and he proceeded. Do you know that I propoSed you both to the club this evening ? Let me See, who will black-ball you! What club, replied the Duke ^ Did not ye know that I am a knight of the knuckle. Said Dickey, in a tone of exultation ? and I’ll lay you Sour hats that you are both knighted next club
night, ril take your bett. Said the
Marquis, but let me know what you mean by Sour hats ? Why, that is the way that we lay wagers in the city: one, two, or as many hats as ye chooSe, and a very good way too---Aysht it, my Lord ? The Duke laughed heartily at the conceit, and
Said it was certainly very proper to promote trade.
Mrs. AnderSon Said, that her Son
had had it greatly at heart to have
them.
THE LABYRINTHS OF LIFE, l6l
them made knights of the knuckle. Indeed it was not every one who could be admitted to Such distinction, but that her Son was greatly beloved in the city.
Mr. AnderSon told us, that the
original bone, which was a beef-bone, was kept at the lodge on Blackheath, and that if the Marquis would ride that way Some morning, he would procure him a fight of it.
Can you conceive any thing So ridiculous as this institution ? I was
in doubt whether it really existed or not; but I have been fince afifured, that there really are Sober citizens poffested of a rage to be fingular, who, on certain occafions, dangle this mutton bgne about with them,

We laughed moii he^irtily at the idea of the Duke s going to eouit wearing the infignia of the order.
I think that Lady Madelina and Mr, Lafeelles bid very fair tp make a very quiet domestic couple, which, in theSe days, is almost a novelty. He has introduced Theodore to her Ladyship and the family. I will not tell you all they Said of him to mt, lest you should be jealous, I believe

You See that you will have a great deal of company, So pray make haste and get your houSe ready for their reception; for I know that Clifford Place will be deferted for Raby Castle.

Sir William and I exult in the
good fortune of Theodore. He was a great favourite of us both.. 1 could not help condemning the uniieceffary feveritj of Mr. Vernon to that young man. Surely his dependent fituation was Sufficient to protect him.from inSuIt, from a feeling mind. There-
is a morofe Severity about Mr. Vernon that will always hinder him from receiving the tribute due to his virtues ;■ for Some he certainly does pofTefs but pride is very predominant in his charaDer. We cannot think how it is poffible for him to give his appro.-bationto Theodore’s union, with Lady de Grey; not that I think it ought:

veiled to Algiers before my curiofity was gratified, and there found him in the perSon of my own Father. It stems to me like a dream, when I restedl on the labyrinths that have led to the diScovery who my real parents were.
We reached this place on Tuefday evening.- My Father had Sent people down, immediately on our arrival in England, in order to prepare Some few of the apartments for our recep^ tion ; for I had given him an account in what a ruinous state the castle was. None of the rooms were habitable, but that wing, which, when I first fiiw it, the old woman reSuSed to* let me fee, faying, that I must excuSe her from shewing that^ as it was Lady Mary’s appartments, and. was haunted..
Little
182 THE LABYRINTHS OF LIFE.
Little did I then think that this Lady Mary was at all related to the unSortunate Theodore. She was my Father’s Mother, and it had been reported that she haunted that part oS the houSe, on account oS the ill treatment that my Father and his Sisters received from the last Lord Raby that inhabited the castle.
This did not hinder us from occupying the most habitable rooms, though it was impostible to get any
of the people who were in the houSe when we arrived to go alone into any room in the castle.
My Father was very fenfibly af-fedted, on our first entrance into this venerable pile of ruins. He Said, it revived in his memory fcenes that had been most dear to him. That he had hoped, if ever fortune
brought

brought him again to this castle, to have had a partner to Share his joy at revifiting the Seat oS his ancestors. OS one who had had more than a share of his Sorrows he could learn no tiding. That She was no more,
must be certain, or Ihe would have
•» /
enquired after her Son, and have owned him.
I Said and did every thing to divert his mind from Such melancholy thoughts, and I imagined I had, in Some meaSure Succeeded, when, yef-terday morning, a post-chaiSe drove up the avenue. My Father was
walking round the outfide of the castle with a furveyor, giving the necestary diredions for its repair, when he just came up as the carriage stopped.

and led her into the houSe,.
I had
joined them by this time. Agnes, Said my Father, do you know this boy.? Know him. Said she! aye in^ deed do I; he is my young master,

She Sat down, and’my Father beg-ed her to be very circumstantial in her relation of all she knew about my Mother..
She, told him, that after he left
her Lady, she mourned continually,.
That-in a very short time she found
her Self

herSelS with child, which in preSent circumstances, greatly added to her grief: that while She continued to receive letters from liim^ she fuppiorted her Spirits, but when 1 had embarked for a foreign land, she entirely gave herlelf up to def pair: that She had witneffed his Uncle’s, treatmen t of his Mother and
Sisters in Silent anguiSh, being un^ able to relieve them, and in Some meafure accufing herfelf as the caufe of that Severity which they So undeservedly experienced.
This pained her So much, that she refolved to remove from th country. Accordingly she and. I came to London, bringing with us what little property she had, which amounted to. between eleven and

hundred pounds, I think.
Wb
l86 THE LABYRINTHS OF LIFE,
We both took a lodging, where Ihe was brought to bed oS my young master. She was much worSe in her health after her lying-in, and she uSed constantly to be talking of what was to become of her darling child, Should stie be taken from him; which. She faid, would Soon happen. I told her, that whilst I lived, lie
should never want for a friend that
* /
would watch over him with all the tendernefs of a parent.
She was pleafed to preSs my hand to her lips, and Say, that she was well assSured of my fidelity. But that she wished him to be properly educated, and to imbibe the notions of a gentleman ; that if ever providence should restore his Father, he might find
f'
him Such as his fondest hopes could paint.
To

THE LABYRINTHS OF LIFE.
To accomplish this, iS heaven should even Spare her liSe, was im-poffible. Her little fortune was inadequate to the taSk. But Ihe had frequently turned it in her mind, and was now, dearly as it would cost her, with my assistance, to put it into pradfice. I afked her what it was ? I shall never forget it, I am Sure, Said Agnes. She raiSed herfelf up in the bed, and faid, this then, Agnes, is my determination : I know a gentleman who posteffes a most noble and liberal mind. To his care will I entrust my fon ; nor Shall he know to
whom he belongs. I will Send with him one thoufand pounds, that is nearly all I have. If ever his
Father returns, it will be before that Sum is expended; and I Shall take care by letters to inform him where
I have
i88 THE labyrinths of life*
I have placed him, should I never live to See his return.
I adviSed her to Send Sor this gentleman, and inform him of her Situation, requesting him to take charge of the child.
This she refufed to do, faying, I will neyer be preSented to my Child as a beggar, which I must be, if his Father never returns. I know Mr.
f
Raymond and his amiable Lady too well to doubt their care of an orphan entrusted to them. I have ever heard my Father, who went to School with Mr. Raymond, mention him as poS? Seshng great fenSibility., To. him shall you carry this Child, after
Swearing to me that you will never give the Slightest hint to whom he belongs, unleSs he is ill treated ; for I entreat you to watch oyer him
whea

when I am gone, as fbon I shall hef If ever his Father returns, I know that he will reward you.
I would have perSuaded her from this, but she was determined. She Said that there w^’as no alternative. Either she must adopt this plan or die in uncertainty as to the future fate of her infant. That when he was received by Mr. Raymond,, she would be certain of his having hispro-testion ; and that, as he had no child
of his own, Iheodore would be'cer-tain of finding a Father in him.
1
Accordingly, the very next evening, after many Severe struggles, my dear Lady tore herSelf from her beloved infant, after shedding torrents of tears on its little boSom, She put her own pidlure, a bank note of one thoufand pounds, and a most:
affecting

affecting letter, into a purSe, which, with the clothes belonging to the
child. She put up in a bundle. She preffed the babe oSten to her breast, Saying, God knows, my Child, what Severe pangs I now Suffer to enSure you protection in your infant state, and perhaps to restore you to your Father and family : to which may you one day do honour 1 Take then a Mother’s laSt blesting. She knelt down and prayed, that heaven would direct his future life, and lead him
to his Father. With this (he gave me the Child, and Said, go, Agnes, take him from me, lest I Sacrifice his welfare to a mistaken fondneSs.
I did as she defired, though heaven knows that it was Sorely against my will. She called me back thrice, e’er I reached the bottom of the

stairs, to take another look at the inSant, who was Smiling in my arms. At length I reached Mr. Raymond’s, and, following my mistrefs’s directions, left the Child.
When I returned, I found its unhappy Mother almost in a state of distradlion. She questioned me a thouSand times how I had conducted mySelf: but as I told her the truth Ihe believed me.
She fent me the next morning into the street where Mr. Raymond lived, in order, if postible, to find out what was faid about the child, and how it had been received. I by
accident met one of the fervants, who affured me, that Mrs. Raymond had determined to bring up the child with great care. I did not Seem at
first to know whofe Servant stie was;
but

192 THE LABYRINTHS OR LIFL^
but on afking her to shew me the way to a street not Sar off, during our walk she told me the whole story of the child just as it was.
I hastened back to my mistreSs with this intelligence.
She
was
happy to hear that the child would be taken care of: yet she was Sorry, I could perceive, that she had let it go. She was very vifibly in a de*-dine, which, in about two months, put 'a period to her existence.
She made me Swear again, when on her death-bed, never to diScloSe to any one but to you, Sir, where your Son was left, whilst he was treated with that fatherly kindnefs which Mr, Raymond, at that early period, shewed towards him.
I have kept my word. It was only last w^eek that I, by accident,

Under what obligations, Edmund, am I to this amiable parent, who, from my birth, had preferred my welfare to her own happinefs, and who Sacrificed her own future east; to procure mine ?
The Subject was So affecting, that my Father wept much. He told Agnes, that she should be provided
for in our family ; for that, 'whilst she was alive, they should never part. The good old creature was extremely rejoiced. She thinks that one of my Aunts is alive. One, she knows, is dead. We shall make every ne-

Separated.
After having fpent a most agreeable evening, we took leave of our friends, and they returned to their refpedive homes. Lady de Grey and myfelf fat down and talked on different fush-jeds for about two hours, and then retired to rest.
We had fcarcely breakfasted, be-fore a Servant arrived from Raby Caf-tie with a note to Lady de Grey, expressing theSe, or words nearly to the fame purport:

On the receipt of this strange epiS-tie, Lady de Grey burst into tears. This greatly SurpriSed me, as I const* dered it to be a mere love-letter—that Theodore had forgot to kiSs her hand at parting ; or had only, perhaps, Said good night once; or had not appointed the hour when they were to

We endeavoured to account for his departure; but, after numberleSs conjectures, we were still in uncertainty. In about an hour after, arrived the elder Mr. Beaumont, as a Servant had told him that, previoufly to his young Master’s departure, he had Sent a letter to Lady de Grey. The old Gentleman, therefore, came for information as to the route of his Son. Lady de Grey Ihewed him the letter she had received, which threw no light on the affair.

afked Mr. Beaumont, whether he had Spoken to his Son on the Subje<st of

the unfortunate Emilia or no ? To j^vhich he replied, that he had shewn Theodore her story, as lent him by Lady de Grey,‘ upon the Suppofition of her being related to the family, and that he had been greatly affedled on reading it; but that he had not Shewn him the last letter She had wrote. This, he Said, was now in his waistcoat pocket, which, being in haste to come to Clifford Place for information, he had not yet changed. Upon this he put his hand in his pocket, but could not find the letter. He Searched his other pockets, to no purpofe. This fully explained Theodore’s departure to us, and alarmed us greatly, for there was no doubt but he was gone in purfuit of Mr.

A few moments before that, I ob-ferved you read a letter attentively, and Saw a tear steal down your cheek. This determined me, if poffible, to get post'eshon of that letter; and having done fo, nothing now remains but to Search out the villian who has betrayed the unfuSpeDing innocence of Emilia, and either force him to do her justice, or give me Satisfastioii for the injury done to my family. One of theSe he shall do ; for I will purSue him to the earth’s utmost verge, being determined that he shall not eScape that chastilement which his crime fo justly merits.

He took his leave j
and I waited impatiently the return

of Mr. Lafcelles, to whom I related what had pasted. He Said, it was
impostible that Theodore and he Should quarrel: for that the last let^ ter that he had received from him was in congratulation on our marriage. This, in Some meaSure; quieted my apprehenfions, though it did not abate my curiofity. At

Arrandale to undertake it
I was
obliged to Seem Satisfied with this anSwer, though I, by no means, was fo. Mr. LaScelles went down stairs again ; and, in about half an hour after, they all three came up stairs and, drank tea; after wshich, my Brother ordered his carriage, faying, that he would Soon return.

Your letter was most welcomej on many accounts j but particularly So to Lady d’e Grey, who was, until it arrived, in a state worSe than even death itSelf: for I confider SuSpence in this light. We have now time and Spirits Sufficient to applaud the conduct of Theodore, as much as we had before condemned it; and we shall greet his return with tears
of joy. He has accomplished for Emilia Fitzalleyne, what the most:
Ullr

unbounded affedfion, I am affured, never could have done. Self-preSer-vation adluated that creature, Mr.
R------, to do an act of justice that
his own breast never would have led him to propoSe. It is my advice, that Emilia be never made acquainted with the part that our Hero has taken to accomplish her happineSs. But rather let it Seem a voluntary act
of Mr. R
—-----■, as her diSpofition
is too noble to let her be happy,, if

she knew that he married her to avoid fighting; which is literally the: cafe.
You have, by this time, the elder

Mr. Vernon. He Says, it was adling with Spirit and propriety ; and that if every poor girl had Such a cham-
pion
there would be fewer Scoun-
drels, and modest women would not be put to the blush every time they go abroad, by beholding the errors
of their own Sex ; whom, though' they may pity, yet they should not
always condemn. This idea I can very eafily enter into, from having Seen it exemplified in the perSon of Emilia, a poor defencelefs female, Scorned and bafely deferted by the very wretch whofe last drop of blood ought to have been Spilt in her defence. I doubt not but there are: many others of my own fex, whofe Senfibility and ill-placed confidence have plunged them into an abyfs of miSery, from which no friendly hand

You will anfwer, that there is one now in existence. So there is t but what I mean, is to genteel Subfistence not on So degrading a plan as that already established'. For I can eafily conceive, that Such a woman as Emilia Fitzalleyne, and it is only for Such that I would be an advocate, would shrink from mixing

See a number of my own Sex refcued from a fituation, from which the un-adulterated mind must look back with horror ? But enough of So unpleaSant a Subjedf.
Lady de Grey Says, that she hopes very Soon to See your Ladyship in this part of the world, as Mr. Beaumont has told her of the Duke of Mortimer’s promife of vifiting Raby Castle very Soon, and that Mr. Laf-cclles and your Ladyship mean to join the party.

fonal interview, intends to renew his addreffes to his own wife, as Soon as decency will permit. I cannot help thinking that Emilia has a title to the name I have given her, as She certainly once confidered herSelf as
married to Mr. R——. He Speaks of her conduct towards him in raptures, which only Serve to aggravate his injuries to her. But as he determines, as far as is now in his power, to redreSs them, I must be content

if she is fo. He excufed his conduct to me thus : that he was under obligations to his Uncle R and the Lady whom he was to marry, he very unfeelingly Said, had one foot in the grave when he led her to

I greatly approve of what Lady Madelina communicated to me, as

Lady Anne Westbury’s opinion, concerning Emilia’s not being made acquainted with the manner in which
Mr. R

What 'a pity it is that people cannot be content to move in the Sphere
which it is evident Nature defign-cd for them, and where they would be reSpedtable, instead of mixing in Societies where they are confidered as truly ridiculous.
Since writing the above, I am informed by Mr. LaScelles that my Mother

DUCHESS OF MORTIMER.
DEAR MADAM,
Raby Caflle
Q
HOPE before this letter reaches your hand, that you will be fo much recovered as to be able to quit your room, and fix a day when you will join our happy party at Raby Castle.
As you could not be preSent, I will endeavour to give you an account of what pastes here.
It was late on Monday evening before we arrived, but as we were expected, the family waited Supper for us. Lady de Grey, Lady Anne Westbury, and Lady JerSey, and Sir
William*
26o the labyrinths of life,
William were there, to whom I was introduced by Mr. Beaumont. I never Saw a more interesting or a more beautiSul woman than Lady JerSey. Lady de Grey is alSo very lovely, but I think Something inferior, as to beauty, to Jemima, though quite her equal in perSonal accomplishments. Soon after Supper, thefe vifitors took tlieir leave, and we retired to rest; for I affure you that
I
I found my Self much fatigued by the journey. The next morning, diredlly after breakfast, we went to Hare wood Grove, the feat of Mr. Vernon, to ^which. place we were attended by a numberof Lawyers, &c. and we were met there by Lady de Grey, Lady Wentworth and family, and a Mr. Davenport, who was to be united, on the next day, to Mifs
Emma

Emma Vernon, who received us with a truly elegant and marked attention. My Father was in high Spirits and greatly pleaSed with his vifit, which, he Said, only wanted your preSence to make it most agreeable. This pleaSure we hope, in a very few days, to experience. My Brother,, on our arrival Said, that he was ex-
9
tremely Sorry that there was no female diSengaged, or that he certainly could not withstand joining the present matrimonial party. This difficulty was removed next day, when he became prodigioufly enamoured of Mifs Wentworth, at which cir-cumstance my Father was highly pleaSed, as he told me in the evening. An union between Arrandale and Mifs Wentworth woiild, he
Said, be mostpleafipg to you as well

as to himSelf. We do not deSpair
of feeing this accomplished before we quit the Castle, which is now reSounding with mirth, in confe-qucnce of the happineSs of its owner.
But I had forgot that you was to have a detail of what happened. Before dinner, at the Grove, all bu-fineSs was fettled to the mutual Sa-tisfadlion of all parties, Mr. Vernon gives up the Grove to his Son, and two thoufand per annum, in conSequence of his union with Lady Anne; though this is by no means an equivalent to her five thoufand

will experience more real felicity than if she had made an interested
union.

We Spent a very happy though, upon the whole, rather a Serious afternoon, at Mr. Vernon’s, and took our leave at an early hour, to prepare
for the next day: which was ap-

R------j -who arrived the day before,
were not of the party to the Grove,
but remained at Raby Castle, as it

would not have been proper for them to appear on So public occafion, on account of thp recent death of his former lady. We found them, on our return, engaged in diScourSe with little Harriet, who came up to me and Said, ** indeed Lady Madelina

that more than equals Mr. R-------*s
expectations, and which, indeed, he does not want. It is to be fettled on the lovely Harriet.
This morning, about nine, arrived Lady Wentworth and Lady Jerfey, Sir William, and MiSs Wentworth. In a few moments after the Vernon family. Charles and Theodore were gone to Clifford Place, in order to conduct their lovely brides to this fcene of general joy. Soon after, they came attended by Mr. Arnold the clergyman, who was to perform the ceremony. His Daughter accompanied them as bride’s maid.
