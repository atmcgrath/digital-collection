They had not long refided in that noble City, before they were the Dif-courle of all the Gentlemen and Ladies in It, and the whole Court rang with the Behaviour and Conduct of the two
they were the Admiration Belles, and confequently the Envy of the Beaux j to lay the Truth, they were both very accom-plifh'd Gentlemen j they could Sing, Dance, and play upon all Kinds of
Mufick to Perfection
and
as
they
were of a becoming Height, lb their Features were fb- agreeable, and the

Turn of their Bodies fb well adapted to the Belle-airej that they wanted none of thofe perfbnal Advantages, that might let off, and give a Grace
Qualit
Endowments of
their Minds: Nor was this all, for they were perfed Mafters of five Languages belides their own, viz. Greeky Latin^ Frenchy Italian and LngUfh ^ they were likewile well vers'd in Hiffoty, Law, Poetry, and all the Branches of the Mathematicks, and very converfant
Writing

as well as thofe of later Authors; they wanted, in Ihort, nothing that might fender them compleat; they had all the Greatnels and Majefty of the Mart in them, which was mollify'd by a Mixture of that Softnefs and Sweet-» nels, which feems peculiar to the fair Sex, and what is ftill more remarkable is, they lb exadly relembled other, that they were often miftaken one for the other ^ the only Mark of Diftindion, was a Mole over the right Eye of Don Guzmany who was the

eldefl, and a very little taller than his Brother; their Drefs, Voice, Air, and even Sentiments were always correspondent to each other, and, by a kind of Sympathy, whatever one proposed, the other of courfe agreed to. Thefe Qiialifications, join’d to the Charader they had fettled with every Body in the City, made their Converfation uni-verlally coveted ; every one ftrove to make himfelf happy in their Acquaintance, and all, in general, thought they could not do themlelves a greater Honour, than when it lay in their Power to offer their Service to ’em, or to do any thing, that might engage them to two fu(^ , eminent Perfons ; the very Ladiesfj who on all other Occalions are rather too relerv’d in their Behaviour towards young Gentlemen, yet, even they, flrove who Ihould be foremoft in their good Opinion, and let no Opportunity flip that might heighten their Rfteem for them, and endear them-felves to them ; if they went to a Play, AlTcmbly, Ball, Mafquerade, or any
other

other publick Diverlion, they were fure to be attended with whole Troops of the fair Sex, who endeavour'd to excel each other, only to be the more obferv’d by the two Brothers, who at length attain'd the Name of Lesfreres Beaux. Their Opinion was always approv’d of, and whatever they Said was an Oracle j if any Argument was llart-ed in Company, their Sentiments, were look'd upon as decifive, and both Parties acquiefeed under them, as e-lleeming them beyond Contradidion.
It happen'd one time, that the two Brothers, having a mind to fee the fine Gardens that belong to the Palace, refblv'd to go the next Day and take a full View of them ; and accordingly after Dinner they went thither, where, from admiring the Beauty that ap^ pear'd every where, in the Dilpofition of the Walks, and the exad Order of the Trees, Shades, Grottos, Fountains, Calcades, and whatever might make the place perfcdly delightful, they fell into a deep Contemplation on the

The Brothers : Or.
Vegitabte World ; and being very
engag’d in it, not minding which Way they went, they were in-fenfibly led into the middle of one of the Wilderneffes, where, Ifill walking without obferving the Labrynth into which they had brought themfelves, in turning one of the Corners that led into a Thicket of Trees, through the middle of which was a fine green Walk that went up to an Arbor, they were awaken’d out of their Study, by a Female Voice that ieem’d to be not far off, which lung the following Song,
The Song

The Song was attended with a very agreeable Symphony of feveral mufical Inftruments between each Stanza, to which the Brothers gave their Attention with a very great delight, and were, in the end, lb far fallen out of one

kind
Brothers: Or,
kind of Contemplation, into another, that they both flood looking at each other in an amaze not to be de-icrited j and were the more confounded, bccaufe they faw in each others Faces, fuch vifible Marks of the Effect the Song had upon them. In
this Manner they Hood a confiderabte
time before they either Ipoke or mov’d, till Don Guzman broke this profound Silence in thele Words, ‘ Jn^ * tomo., laid he, my dear Friend and ‘ Brother Antonio^ if eithef of thofe ^ facred Names can excufe my Bold-^ nels, in asking a (Jueflion that may ‘ in no wife be proper or becoming ^ for me, if that conflant Ttuft you ^ hav9 always repos’d in me, can in-? ^ duce you to anfwer what I now
tell me, for my Soul thirfts to what could caufe that fudden Change in your Countenance, or what flrange Ideas fill your Mind, that can make fb quick a Meta-morphofis, and give that Face a call, it was ever before a Stranger to ? ’■
Don
Treachery funiJPd, 9
Don Guzman exprefs’d thefe Words with fo much Force and Energy, and withal embracing his Brother lb ten-, derly, that Don Antomo finding it Was in vain to endeavour to conceal his Affair any longer, was juft going to return his Brother an Anlwer, when they were interrupted by a Company of Ladies and Gentlemen, who having been informed they were enter’d the Wil-dernefs, had follow’d ’em to take that Opportunity of getting acquainted with them. The two Brothers, tho’ they were very unealy in their Minds, yet feeing the Company approach them, they recollected their uliaal Cheerful-nels, and put on a Face that feem’d to ipeak a Heart very different from theirs.
A s loon as they were met, and had paid their Relpects to each other ; one of the Gentlemen thus addrels’d him-felf to them \ * Gentlemen, we beg ‘ Leave to inform you, that you are ^ in the midft of a large Wildernels ; ^ gnd as it will be yery difficult for
‘ you
10 Brothers: Or,
* you to find your way back, and you ^ leem Strangers to the Place, we of-‘ fer our Service to Condud you out ‘ of it^. The Brothers return'd this Civility with a low Bow, and Don Guzman reply’d, ‘ Gentlemen and La-dies, we think our lelves doubly For-^ itunate, not only in finding a Guide ‘ out of the Labrynth, but that we ‘ have had the Happinefs to meet with ‘ Company that condelcend to Honour ^ us fo much beyond what we either ‘ deferv'd or expected ; we own, you ‘ havelaid us under a greater Obliga-‘ tion than we are capable of return-- ingjbut beg you would Honour us yet ^ farther, by commanding any thing in ‘ our Power, and think we ihall do it ^ with the greateft Satisfaction imagin-
C ‘ Sir, Paid one of the Gentlemen, interrupting him, if I am too bold, Pardon me, in asking whether you are SfamardV ‘ We are. Sir, reply'd Don Antomo \	‘ And how
long is it fince you left Spam., pray Gentlemen ? laid one of the Ladies
‘ About
Treachery funiJPd,
11
About two Months, Madam, reply^d Don Guzrnan'. ‘ Then, Sir, laid the Lady, you muff have heard of the
unfortunate Alvare

At the Name of Alvarez they both turn’d Pale, and Don Guzman made Anfwer, ‘ Yes Ma-‘ dam, we have heard of his Misfbr-‘ tunes, and not heard only, but we ^ have been Eye-witneffes of Ibme part ‘ of ’em, and if the Day were not al-‘ moft at an end, and the Account of ‘ them very long, I fhould be very ‘ ready to give you a Relation of ‘ them’. ‘ Sir, laid one of the Gen-tlemen, tho’ the Day permit not an ^ Account of them, if you will oblige ^ us with your Company this Evening, we fhall find Time enough to hear ^ them, and fhall ‘ Favour, that you will give your lelf ^ lb much Trouble’.
Don Guzman^ who was all this time upon the Rack, by realbn of his Brother’s Behaviour juft before, and impatient for an Anlwer to his Qiieftion, ibiight to excule this unexpeded In--
yitation,
take it as a great

The Br. others: Or
vitation, by anfwering the Gentleman, thus: ‘ Sir, This is a favour much
*	greater than pur Merits can entitle ‘ iis to, which makes us the more ‘ griev'd we can't accept of it, being
*	pre-engag'd upon an Affair of the ut-^ mofl Importance, to meet Ibme Gen-^ tlemen that are to let out for Spam to ^ morrow Morning very early' ‘ Sir, ‘ laid one of the Ladies, if your Bufi-^ nels is of that Importance, that you ^ canT pleafure us wdth your Company ‘ this Evening, we dehre of you, up-‘ on the Word of a Gentleman, not-to
fail meeting us to Morrow in the Afternoon, in this Garden, to latisfy that Curiofity we have long had, to be more fully acquainted with
Adventure of Don Alvarez*.

L
th

Madam, reply'd Don Guzman.^ it is enough that you defire any thing in ‘ our PoWer, well be fure to be punc-^ tual'. With fuch kind ofDifcourfe as this, they walk'd till they came to the Entrance of the Garden, where the Lady again laid, ^ Sir, we depend

^ Madam, reply’d Don Guzman\ and lb parted with them, and went direDly with his Brother to their Lodging, where as loon as they where fate down, they re-affumed the Difcourfe the Company had oblig'd them to quit, and Don Antomo began thus, ‘ My dear ‘ Guzmanbefore I anlwer your Que-‘ ftion, I mull implore your Pardon ‘ for that Violation of our Friendftiip ‘ I have been guilty of, in lb long ‘ keeping a Secret from you wherein ‘ my Honour and Reputation, as wxll ‘ as Eafe and (^iet are lb highly con-‘ cern'd'^ here he paus'd, and Don Guzman more amaz'd than ever, knew neither what to lay nor how to behave himfelf in this Dilemma; which Don Antonio taking Notice of, after a long Silence he began again thus ^ ‘ I fee ^ Don Guzman.^ the Surprize you are ^ in, but I dare fay you will be in a
much greater when I tell you I am

When this Entertainment was ended, the Company went to Supper; after which, Don Guzman and Don , Antonio^ went home to Bed; where, Don Antomo could not get one wink of Sleep, but Sent out Sighs that would have melted the most stony Hearts to CompafTion ; which were now and then follow’d by the Name of EL mira; and again, ‘ ah bafe and too ‘ forward Clariana'*,
D ON Guzman at hearing the Name of Elmira.^ Soon found out whence he deriv’d, that Pallion that So tormented him.
This Elmira w^as a Lady lately come to Town, and had taken Lodg-
directly over against thofe of the Brothers; She came last from Madrid thither for the Diveiston of

Next Door to her, liv’d Clariana^ a Lady of a tolerable Share of Wit, but She made ufe of it, So muchj every where, and upon all Occalions, in all Company, that every Body Soon grew weary of her, but this Spamjb Lady ; who, tho’ fhe did not much admire her Conversation, but being a Stranger in the City, and not acquainted with any Body elSe, She us’d to paSs away a tew Hours, now and then, with her, for w^ant of better Company.
Don Guzman was as deeply wounded widi Elmird.*s Beauty, as Don An-tonio., and was often going to declare his Pallion to him, but one
or other interfering, he never had an Opportunity for it ; which he was exceedingly glad of; and judging, by his Brothers outward Uneafinefs, that his inward Grief proceeded from EL mird.s difdain, he inferr’d from thence, that it was not yet too late to make his AddreiTes, and infinuate himfelf into her Favour; with thefe kind of Thoughts he pleas’d himfelf, till considering

They walk’d along Time together
without changing a Word, till Don An-tonio recovering himfelf from the profound Thoughts he was engag’d in, he turn’d to his Brother and, embracing him tenderly, Said; ‘ My Guzman.^ ‘ by our Friend Ship as well? as Kindred, \; by thofe Promifes you fo lately rene w-‘ ed,and by the Confidence I have al-‘ ways repos’d in you; I conjure you, ‘ and entreat you, to alfift me in an ‘ Affair, in which without your help,

if I would come thither, he Should take it as a great Favour. I went immediately to him, where his Friends, with the reft of the Paf-fcngers, were juft alighting out of the Coach, as I came in; among which was the beautiful Elmira: I no Sooner beheld her, but likQ Ah are I was So deeply wounded by thofe powerful Charms with which She was arm’d, that notwithftanding all the Reafon I could Summon up to my Aid, I found my Wound too deep for any other Remedy, but what Ihe could afford it.

were to go in the

With thefe, and Such like Reafons, he Soon perSuaded himfelf of his own InnocencCj and the Juftice of his Caufe; and his Love, the Motive upon which lie acted, urg’d him to believe the reft of the World w^ould acquit him in the fame manner. Night came on, and the two Brothers went to Clariand.s Houle, where they found Elmira., who was furpriz’d to fee Don Guzfnan with his Brother, and Said to Clariana., ‘ I ‘ thought w»^e fhould have had only ‘ bon Antonio'^s Company this Even-

She had no Sooner ended, than Don Guz,mai% coming up to Salute her, She receiv’d him with a becoming Modesty, that charm’d him more than before, and confirm’d her Conquest over him : And he Soon found by a little Conversation with her, that the Qualifications of her Mind, exceeded her outward Beauty, as much as her Beauty exceeded that of Clariana ; as his Brother, Don	was coming up to her, She
turn’d Pale, and Said Scornfully; ‘ Sir, ^ I beg you would not come near me, ‘ I am So 111, I Shall Swoon away if ^ you touch me’. Don Guz,man vQ--joyc’d at this, and triumph’d in his Brother’s Misfortunes, thinking to

Words of Comfort to Don Guzman,
but Don Antonio heard them with a
Heart ready to burst with Grief, for
the Reception he had met with; yet
hoping the Opinion fhefeem’d to have
of his Brother, might make her the
more readv to hear him, he made

Clariana was now left alone with Don Antoniowhich was what She defir’d, and after having remain’d Silent Some Time, in Expectation of a formal Declaration of Love from him, She began thus : ‘ Don Antonio,, ‘ if all the Gentlemen in Spain are of ‘ your Temper, they muft certainly ‘ be a long while in gaining the Af-* Sections of the young Ladies; Sure ‘ they are not all fo negligent and di-‘ latory, or is it the Custom of your ‘ Country, for the Ladies to make ‘ their Adct*effes to the Men ?

Don Guzman read this with the greatest Confufion imaginable, and took it So much to Heart, that he fell Sick in two or three Days Time; and notwithstanding he had the Advice of the ablest and most skilful Fhystcians in all Verfailles, he grew worfe and worfe, till at last they gave him over, declaring, that his Distemper proceeded

It was the most filthy Place, that I believe, ever Mortal beheld; it was So dark, I could hardly fee my Hands, and what little Light I had, it was only from a Wicket, through which they us’d to give me my Victuals; my Bed was nothing but an old Hammock, with a couple of Blankets, that ferv’d as a Nest for the Vermin, with
which

which 1 was over-run 5 the Floor was very ill laid, and So near the Bottom of the Ship, that whenever the Sea was a little rougher than ordinary, the Water dafh’d in upon me through the hollow Places of it; and this was all the walking and cleaning it had; from the time I first went in, to the time I came out, I never was So much as fuffer’d to change my Cloaths, or e-ven my Linen: My Allowance was only three Small Biskets a Day, and thofe of the coarfest Sort; and my Drink was only a Pint of Water a Day, which generally stunk, and I was oblig’d to throw it away, chufing rather to be parch’d with Thirst, than drink Such nasty Liquor.
IN this deplorable melancholy Condition, I had time enough to reflect upon my Misfortunes, and Sometimes I wou’d lament, and Say, to my Self, ‘ Unhappy Alvarez. I how defperate ‘ is thy Cafe 1 here thou art confin’d, ‘ without any of the Comforts or Ne-‘ ceSTaries of Life, or even a Proba-

My dear Father, how rightly didst thou judge of him when but an In-Sant ; how truly didst thou foretel, that my Mother wou’d not Scruple to wrong me, for the Sake of her darling Villain Sebajhan^ who triumphs in my Calamity: But why do I reflect upon them ? Why ShouM my Mother or Brother be blame-able ? Was not I undutiful to her, in concealing my Self from her three Years together ? Yes certainly , and it’s that has harden’d her Lleart a-gainst me ; Was I not wrong, in letting my Brother believe he was in the PofTeflion of the Estate, when I was alive to lay Claim to it ? Had

I WAS in thefe Meditations one Day, when I heard, on a Sudden, a great NoiSe of Guns ; and the Ship Shook very much, which made me conclude She was in an Engagement, and presently after, a Ball broke down tl^e Sides of my Dungeon, and the Ship began to take in Water. I could hear the Men pump very fast, and cry out loud for Quarter; which was granted them,

Seeing me deliver’d from my PriSon, would fain have perSuaded the Men to fling me over-board, but they refusing, he jump’d into the Sea, himfelf, and was drowned; five of the fix Sailors, that were privy to my Confinement, follow’d their Captain’s Example, but the Sixth, not caring to leave this World, went to the Com-^ mander, and falling down on his Knees, confess’d who 1 was, and how I came to be in that Condition.

Things were now bravely alter’d, and I fleep’d very well in my new A-. partment; and the next Day, the Captain and I fell into Difcourfe, about the Villain that had confin’d me So long in his Ship: He told me his Name was Lopsz,, a Pyrate, that had infested thole Seas Sometime, plundering every Ship that had fallen in his Way; and that by all Account, I must have been full four Years in my Dungeon, without once feeing the Face of Day, or being refrefh’d by one Breath of frelh Air: I then told him my former Misfortunes, and how I came to be reduc’d to the State he found me in ; with a great deal more of tl^e like Difcourfe.
