Y name, as ah Author, being totally unknown to the Public, I have had the pleafure of liIPning in filence to the opinion of all my acquaintance, as well as moft intimate friends, on the Memoirs of Mrs. WiL Hams, none of whorh fufpeded me to
be interefted in what they faid upon the fubje6t.
I found the Many believ’d the book to be really a tranflation from the

refemblance to truth, “ fince Mrs, “ WilUamd.^ charadler never could have exifted in real life.” They,
therefore rank’d her Memoirs among the herd of that fpecies of writing, which pours upon us every year from the pens of worn-out Chambermaids, and indigent Valet de Chambres, Cfr. Cfr. l^c. Some of thefe Fair Ones
went fo far as to adviSe me not to
<
read the book, alluring me, that it was not worth the perufal, “ it was “ fo grave, and full of ftupid digref-“ fions.” Thefc' judicious readers
did not mortify me, becaufe I had bought the Review for the month of May^ where I found myfelf treated
with the utmoft good humour, and
lenity ?

much more fenfibly, than the cenfunj of the illiterate could humiliate it.
Two or three perSons, who were well acquainted with my hiftory, ea-lily put the real names to the charac-
ters drawn in Mrs.
s Me-
moirs ; to them I could not be c.on-cealed, and, therefore, Secur’d 'cheif fecrecy, by candidly owning naySelf the Author : They compliment :d me upon the language in which I had told my Story *, but Said that, ir \ their
opinion, there was very little n aerit in

putting faCts upon paper in a good ftile; fince the firll intirely depended upon memory and the Second, on the
education which had been given us, and the company we had kept; declaring, at the Same time, that they
thought there was infinitely more merit in inventing an interefting Ilory, than in telling a true one ever So well. I did not diSpute the point with them, and thought no more of the matter at that time ; but happening to go into the country Some months after, where I Spent mod: of my time alone, being diftant from any neighbourhood, the unfafhionable occupations of reading, w'riting, and working, were my only amuferaents, and I confefs that I Sound them quite Sufficient to render retirement delightful.

I determin’d to try my genius in the Novel way; but I Soon perceiv’d, that mine was a matter of fa6t one ; for, whilfl: I wilh’d to invent, I found a variety of incidents, which had really happened, croud upon my memory, and in a manner .force me to narrate them ; among theSe was the Ilory of Mr. Merton ; which, however improbable it may appear to my readers, was, I moft firmly believe, a faft, fmee I had the heads of it from the

With the utmoft truth I declare, that I do not admire my own performance ; it amusM me whilft I wrote it; and if it Serves to fill up an hour or two of the vacant time which hangs fo heavy on that part of my Sex, who read no other books than Novels, my

“ and with all theSe things, I think, one cannot be otherwife than chear-“ ful, and happy.’* The juft efti-mation which poor Sufan had made of the neceflaries of life, as well as of its pleasures, ftruck me; and made
me afhamed to find, that Ibe pofiefled, in that moment, more Solid judgment, and real good SenSe, than her miftreSs

by the comparison, I had juft been making between Sufan and mySelf,

pulling me by the Qeeve, Said, “ Dear
“ Lady Duy, do fee what a pretty “ looking Gentleman that is in blue

B 3	raifed
[ 6 ]
my eyes, which met thofe of the moil graceful figure I ever beheld, who, with a genteel bow, offered me his hand to help nie out of my riage. I accepted it, rather aubward-ly, I believe, becaufe, very ridkulouf-iy, I felt myfelf confuSed. A Beau
was no new Beau!

, he handed me into the

room defined by the landlord for my reception, and then, with an expref-five look, and a low bow, retired, but BOS before, he had Said a great deal about the honour of having polft&d my hand, though but for a moment, and much more so the fame purpoSe; which was loft upon me, for there was fuch a neiSe in the inn, and my Spirits were in Such a flutter, that I did not hear half he faidi.

I am glad to hear it, with all my heart. Said Sufan, becaufe, if Sir Jaf-perh family fhould prove ftupid, a
vifit from this young Gentleman will enliven the Scene a little. Here I
interrupted the volubility of my maid, by ordering Thomas to inform me when Lord Keljh was gone, and then to get my chaiSe ready immediately ; he obeyed,’ and I left the inn without

Lady Hackit has effeftnally routed them out, and transplanted her own in their Head : He retains, however, (by her Ladyfhip’s permiffion, I fuppoSe) a kind of old-fafhioned ceremonious ■gallantry, which is very fatiguing: He is in his figure very like my idea of a Spedlre, tall, thin, and grim ; he moves, too, with a deliberation which would do no diflionour to the dignity of a oholl.
I wondered all this time that Mr. Hackit., the Son and heir of this noble pair, had not yet made his appearance ; and therefore thought it but civil to enquire after him. Sir Jaf-prr, bowing. Said, that his fon was peculiarly unhappy in being obliged

Do you really think, yWhBolton, that, from three years of age to the preienc time, you have been able to Spend annually the whole-intereft of that large Sum of money which was paid to me on your father’s deceaSe ?

Whilfl: they rehearfed this prayer (or whatever they called it) the Nuns all flood in ranks, with their veils down, their

The Lay Sillers waited at all the tables; the AbbeSs had a good dinner of filh and vegetables, for it was a meagre day, being Friday. The Nuns who were hot with us had each, I observed, their portions Served, in Separate plates, from the kitchen ; but what they conSiIled of I could not gueSs, only I thought it an uncomfortable manner of eating. The Ladies at our table eat heartily, during which time a young Nun fat near us reading, with a very audible voice, (in order to be heard all over the room,) the lives of the Saints, though I took notice that nobody Seemed to lillen to her but myfelf *, the ftory Ihe that day read appeared to me Ib very extraordinary a one, that, I am certain, I Shall never forget it whilft I live; it

tinned flood at her chair back, and feemed to oblerve us with an attentive, and, I thought, a jealous eye. When we rofe from table, we all went into the garden, which was really a fine one, and extremely extenSive : Some of the young Ladies played at ball, others at bowls; in Short, every one

Madam La Conception neither fpoke, nor underftood one word of Englijhy fo that my companion and I converted with perfecb eaSe in that language before her, which leemed. to give her pain, for Ihe frequently interrupted us; at laft Ihe infifted upon our walking about, fearing, Ihe Said, that we might take cold from fitting fo long in the air: “ The devil take her.

was Ihewn to mine, which was a neat

little room, next to that of one of the miftrefles of the clafs, for Ib thoSe Nuns are called, who prefide over the education of the children j this I found was a dillindlion paid to me rather uncommon, as all the other girls, excepting myfelf and Mifs Merton.^ flept in two long rooms, like thoSe in an hofpital, with little beds, ranged pretty cloSe together, on each fide of the room; in each of theSe rooms lay one of the Miftreiles: 1 was glad to find I had a chamber to myfelf, to which I even long’d to retire, in order to.refled with liberty on the novelty of my preSent fituation.
The next day brought me a kind letter from Lady Plumflead, together with a neat bureau, which contained
every

[ 205 ]
every necefiary material for writing, as alSo a drefling glafs, lilver candleftick, wax candles, tea, coftee, chocolate in abundance, together with a Set of tea cups, fpoons, a knife and fork, fome Iheets, towels, and a number of other things, which you muft procure for yourSelf, or go without in a Nunnery. I was never fo rich before in my life, and fancied myfelf in a fituation to Set
up houSe-keeping if I chofe it.
I Con-
figned, however, all thele things to the care of a Lay Sifter, who was appointed to wait upon me in the capacity of my maid. A Lay Sifter is a Nun, but one who is not obliged to prove her birth to be noble, as thofe of the choir (as they call themlelves) are; they are required to bring much left money into the Convent than their Superiors, and therefore make up that deficiency by their labour, as they are the only Servants in the houSe. There is alSo Some
trifling

[ 2o6 ]
trifling difference in their dreSs, beSides its being made of coarfer materials, in order >to dillinguifh them from their MiftrelSes; nor are'they admitted to fay all the Service of the church with their Superiors, but have bounds Set them how far they fliall go in the prayers, and no farther; as if the Almighty (like his creatures) was a re-fpecter of wealth and titles.
I had not flept all the night, my head was too full of what I had feen in the day ; I roSe, therefore, rather incommoded, and went into the claSs, or School room, where I found MiSs Merton ; Ihe advanced eagerly up to
me, and begg’d I would do her the honor of breakfafting with her; I readily confented, and we had a little table in a corner of the room to our-

but me fhe embraced with tranfport,

exclaiming. And are you returned, my Louifa! how my heart joys to fee you ! Thus we went on, our friend-fliip increafing with our years: We could have wilh’d to have Spent more of our time together alone, than was in our power to do, though we fought every poffible opportunity to this ef-fe£b, but Fanny*^ old Argus efFedually defeated all our Schemes, by hardly ever Suffering her charge to be a moment out of her fight, and though She could not underftand what we Said, yet fhe watch’d our every look and gefture.
After I had Spent four years in this delightful retreat, my father wrote me, that he, and my mother, wifh’d to See me in England^ and would either fend for, or fetch me very fhortly. I trembled at the apprehenfion of being Separated from my friend, and therefore, in my anfwer to the moft indul-

gent of parents, begg’d they would not think of taking me home, at a time when I was making the greateft progreSs in my ftudies *, intreated, that they would conlider how much time I had loft whilst I remained in Eng-land^ urging that I was yet too young to be introduced into the world, and, therefore, could be no where So properly placed as where I then was. They kindly granted me more time. Lady Jane Carr and I made frequent excurfions to Paris, but they were generally Shortened by my intreaties to her, that we might return to our Convent, and She, good-naturedly, always complied with my fequeft. I muft here obferve, that it’s a great error in whoever fuppofes all Nuns to be unhappy. I had an opportunity, during the courSe of Six years and upwards, which I fpent in a Convent, to convince myfelf of thecontrary: many,
'	nay,

Pride, that fburce of pleasure and of pain, is, in them, a great inftrument towards their felicity; they look upon themfelves as a fpecies of beings Superior to all others, but the Clergy, and them they venerate almoft to idolatry; they are not Priejis^ ’tis true—but they are Priejlejfes^ which, in their opinion, is the Second order of human creatures, and consequently they look down on the reft of the world with no Small degree of pity and contempt; then they tell you, that they are the chafte SpouSes of Jefus Chrijl j and nothing can affront them

more than to be called old maids; they cannot bear the epithet, though, at the fame time, it would be thought no lefs than Sacrilege to doubt of their being immaculate virgins. The in-Ilitutors of all orders of religious Societies (at leaft of women) have prudently foreSeen the dangerous conSc-quences which muff necelSarily ariSe from allowing them too much leiSure for reflexion *, for which reaSon, their rules are calculated to keep them in perpetual employment; they move by the clock, and are almoft as much machines as it; the many, however, certainly are So ; thoSe few among them, who are diftinguilh’d by Superior parts, find occupation enough, in their Schemes for rifing to the firft dignities of the oraer; ’tis incredible what arts they will prafliSe (and that for years together) in order to attain power; the AbbeSs is not leSs Surrounded
[ 2*7 ]
rounded by her flatterers than an Eaftern Monarch •, and though they are fewer in number, yet are they not in the leaft inferior to them, either in addreSs, or hypocriSy ; and all this is tranfadled with an air of the moft tranquil humility. On the day of an election of a Nun to fome high office in the Convent, not the leaft agitation of Spirit appears, either in the countenances or behaviour, of any individual among them ; though I myfelf have known, that, for fix months, or more, before the time ofeledlion, every Spring has been put in motion, and every art eflTay’d, whether by bribes, promiSes, entreaties, flattery, or threats, to gain Suffrages for themSelves, or favourite candidate; yet all this is done with Such an air of devout refignation, and difintereftedneSs, that, to look at them,
one would SuppoSe their conversation to be only in Heaven, and that they

He foon recovered himfelf, when holding my hand, which he continually preSs’d in his, he enquir’d minutely into every circumftance of my life, whilft I was in the Convent. Tou., my Louifa.^ who was, and are, my exiltence, was all my theme; the ftory of my love was the hiftory of my life. My father Smil’d at the raptures with which I mention’d you, and exclaim’d, O Nature, Nature! but my Dear, faid he, you are too young yet to think of matrimony, and ■ this love affair will, I fear, engroSs too much of that attention which ought
to_ be apply’d to your improvement.

Poof boy, continued he, you have much to learn, and more to unlearn, and that in a very Ihort time, too, for you are now near eighteen, an age when you ought to have commenc’d man in Head of Scholar ♦, I therefore
intreat, my dear Son, that you will give your utmoft application to the attainment of thofe accomplilhments, which are absolutely neceflary in a young Gentleman of your rank and fortune; and to this effed, you muft forget your miftrefs, Franks at leaft for Some years. That I can never do, I reply’d. Well, then, faid my father, if you can’t forget, I muft inlift oit your not feeing her, for fear the fight
of her fhould divert you from the purfuit of your ftudies. To this laft injundion I made no anfwer, becaule 1 could not aflent to it. The next day I was equipt as you now fee me, Louifa^ and commenc’d man 5 nothing

in nature could be So aukward as I then was, nay, and ftill am, in this dreSs; I hope, however, that time will make it more eafy to me. I have tried every poflible means of coming hither, but ineffedlually till to-day, and I was too cloSely watch’d to be able to write. “ And now, my amia-“ ble miftreSs, as well as friend, (Said the Sweet youth,) “ will you not love “ me as well as you did when you was ignorant of my fex ? Yes, I

know you will—you mull—my

“ heart is not alter’d by the change, “ why then fhould that of my beloved “ Louifd.s ?” Covered with confuSion at all the wonders I had heard, I, blufli-ing, anfwer’d. It is not in my power, Mr. Merton.^ to ceafe loving you, you mull therefore ever be dear to the heart of your wretched Louifa. Why wretched ! repeated he; that can never be, fince you mnlf, you Ihall be mine.
My
t 259 J
My father’s fondneSs can refuSe me nothing, and my mother has, by the unravelling of her plot, entirely loft his confidence, and (I really fear) his efteem alSo; fo that her oppofition to our happinefs will be of little or no impediment to it. The reft of our conversation was like that of all lovers^ *Iulia., not worth repeating •, the evening parted us, he promiSed to See me frequently, we plighted our mutual vows of love and conftancy, and then reludlantly bid each other adieu.
About this time I received a letter from my father, in which he tells me, that my brother George would foon arrive at Parity from Italy, and that he would accompany me to England.
Mr. Merton now made me frequent viSits, but, being apprehenfive of a difcovery, he dismounted at Some di-ftance from the Convent, ordering his Servant to walk the horfes about, till

I muft beg you to re* mark, Julia, that all the Nuns (excepting the Abbefs, and two others, who were in the plot,) were as totally ignorant of Mr. MertoPs Sex as I had been *, therefore, the great alteration which change of dreSs had made in him, joined to their having no fufpi-cion of the thing, rendered him totally unknown to thofe Nuns who Spoke to him at the Tour ; they therefore concluded, I believe, that he was a Suitor to me, under the protedion of Lady Plumjiead, and, consequently, with the perfe<5b approbation of my friends} in order to confirm which opinion. Lady Jane (who was let into the Secret) declar’d that he was a near relation of her’s, and often accompanied me into the parlour when Mr. Merton was
there.

there. At laft my brother arrived at Paris^ and loon after came to the Convent : He then told me, that he Ihould not ftay much longer in France, but as he could not fix the time, he would take care and let me know Some days before, that I might pack up my things, and prepare for my journey to England. He then alked to fee Mademoiselle La Fare, who was a Pen-fioner in the houfe, and a lifter, he Said, of an acquaintance of his, with whom he had contrafted a friendlhip in Italy, This girl was an envious, ill-temper’d creature, and much dillik’d by all the young Ladies; but her mind was by no means portrayed in her face 5 on the contrary, Ihe look'd like the pidure of candor and good temper; On her entrance into the parlour, my brother told me I might retire, as he had Something particular to fay to Wii%LaFare^ which concern'd her family; I inftantly

I now grew very uneaSy at the thoughts of leavingwhilll my Lover was ftill in it, and not likely, I thought, to quit it Soon : However, I Saw him often, and our meetings were ever accompanied by the Same transporting delight on the fight of each other; when one evening, myjulia^ how Ihall I find firength to narrate this part of my hiftory I after having Spent an hour with Mr. Merton in the parlour, it growing late, he took his leave, after renewing his vows of eternal fidelity and love, promifing Soon to follow me to England. The dread I had of going there made my heart fink with Sorrow. After bidding him adieu, I
called
[ 263 ]
called him back again, though I had nothing to Say, but that, as I knew not the time of my brother’s departure, it might be Sudden, and perhaps I might never fee my dear Merton more. He kindly chid my fears, afiuring me, that I Ihould fee him the very next day, and took his leave.
He left me reftleSs and unhappy \ I

wept bitterly, and, left any one Ihould perceive I did fo, I went immediately into Lady Jand.s room, where fhe and I fat talking on the fubjedt till near nine o’clock: The Nuns had been long in bed, and the Penhoners all (except ourSelves) were fo too, when, all^of a Sudden, Lady Jane and I were alarm’d by a ringing at the great gate, a thing which had, probably, never happened before, at fo late an hour, lince the building of the Convent; we both ftarted from our feats at once, crying. Good God! the houfe is on

Terrify’d to death at what I heard, I alk’d, if her Lady-Ihip knew the perfon whom my brother had kill’d ? She anfwer’d. No; but in a manner which alTured me that Ihe did not Speak the truth. We foon arrived at the Ambaflador’s hotel, when I was oblig’d to be lifted out of
the coach ; I had, indeed, almofl: been

large dining room, at the farther end
of which fat my brother, in a penfive
poflure, leaning his. head upon his
hand : As Soon as I approached him.
Wretched, imprudent girl, cry’d he.
looking fternly at me, to what diftrefs
have you brought your brother, by
your indiscretion. How long he con-
tinued to upbraid me I know not, I
heard no more ; my fenSes were now
departed, and left my tortur’d heart
fome Ihort interval of eaSe. Lady
Plumjieadl and her daughter, (cruelly
kind) forced me to life and miSery
again, which George perceiving, went
on thus: “ Next week, Mifs,, you
“ Ihail go with a Lady of my ac
“ quaintance to England, and I charge

you, as you value your peace and
“ honor, not to mention one word of
this affair to our parents; let it be

buried

** buried in filence, there at Jeafl, “ though it’s impoffible it Should be
“ So on this Side of the water; Here
“ your reputation is irretrievably loll, “ by the irregularity of your con-du6t.” So faying, he frown’d on
t
me, and then thank’d his noble friends for their goodnefs and civility to him-felf and his Sifter *, after which he left the hotel by a private door, and got into a poft-chaife, which was waiting for him in a bye ftreet. My Lord Plumjlead Sent proper people to eScort him, till he was out of danger of being taken on his road to Holland. Lady Plumjlead now told me, that George had been inform’d, by Mademoiselle La Fare, that I carried on an intrigue with a young fellow, who made me frequent vifits; add-ing, that ftie did not know his name, but fuppoSed him td be fomebody
who
[ 268 ]
who was much my inferior, as he was afliam’d to make himfelf known, (fhe imagin’d,) by his always contriving to alk for me while the Nuns were in the church faying Vefpers, This information fired my brother, and he fet fpies to watch our motions, and to give him notice as footj as the young man arrived at the Convent. But being himfelf one day coming to vifit me, he faw two horfes at fome diftance from the houfe, led by a Servant backwards and forwards, as if they were in waiting. My bro» ther alk’d the fellow who they belong’d to The man anfwer’d, fur-lily, To my mafter. And who’s your 'mafter, rafcal ? faid George. That 1 won’t tell you, reply’d the fellow: Upon which my brother determin’d to fee their owner ; for which pur-
pofe he waited to fee who would
come
C 4% 3
come out of the Convent, and Soon faw Mr, Merton advance towards his horfes; he let him come near, and then, in a peremptory tone, demanded his name, and his bufinels in that Nunnery ? Mr. Merton^ who did not know my brother, and not chuling to discover his name, an* fwer’d him in his own ftile: In fhort, high words aroSe, they drew,. Mr. Merton was run through the body, and left dead upon the fpot. Here, my dear Lucy., the lovely, afflided Louifa finilhed her ftory, and with it (I really thought) her life, for, on pronouncing the lafl: words, fhe fell (apparently) dead into my arms, I called out for help, we lay*d her lifelefs body on the bed, and I was almofl: diftracfed with re-morfe, and Sorrow, at having (thro* an ill plac’d curioficy) reduced her
to

to this condition. I fat up with
/-
her all night: From the time Ihe recover’d her fenSes She wept inceS-fantly; I join’d, moft heartily, my tears to her’s. My God! how I pity this unhappy girl! and how I dread the arrival of Lady Jane Carr I the fight of whom will, I fear, be too much for her weak frame to bear: Teach me, my friend, how to comfort, as well as to Support the finking Spirits of this Sweet mourner. Adieu ; my eyes are out with crying, as well as with transcribing this long ftory, which I Set down upon Scraps of paper, at the different periods as She narrated it, and have now copied fair for your peruSal.

OW amiable is your condudt, my dear Lady Lucy., with regard to poor Sufan ! Many a girl in her Situation has been loll for want of fuch a friend ; a moment is fufEcient to ruin the perfon of a girl, but it requires a length of time to corrupt a mind that has been virtuoully educated. How cruel therefore mull the cafe of thoSe unhappy females be, who, from a momentary fedudtion of the fenSes, find themfelves at once abandoned by the women, and treated with the moll mortifying familiarity by the men, without a poflibility of ever regaining
the
\
[	41	]
the road to virtue! which is barred againft them by the turpitude (allow me the expreffion) of their own Sex, Vv^ho fooliflily imagine, that they heighten their own charaDers in the Same degree, as they tear to pieces, and depreciate, thofe of others ; and that a violent zeal in the persecution of theSe unhappy fair ones, is a poli-tive proof of their ov/n immaculate purity. Thus loft to the Society they had been uSed to, vice ooens her arms to receive them; they Shudder at her approach, but having no alternative, follow her : Time and bad company render her familiar, till in the end they become the difgrace of our fex, as well as the reproach of the other.
How many wretches
of thefe unfortunate
might be Saved,* did all women think and act like-you, Lucy ? In my opinion, you can place Sufan
no
[	42	]
no where better than with Mrs. Lewis. I need not tell you how ready I Ihould be to receive her here 5 but then I muft give up the pleaSure of Seeing Lord Latton this Summer: as I agree with

What confliDing paffions mull: tear her bofom} Love, fhame, and remorle, are doubtleSs the cruel inmates of her bread:: Poor girl! with fuch companions, how can die know peace ? “ for peace, O virtue ! peace “ is all thy own.” Lady Jane Carr arrived here a few days ago ; She is lovely beyond defcription, and has, if I am not midaken, a good deal of . the coquette in her composition, owing, I fuppoSe, to her Paris education j yet every thing She fays and

All this you fee, my dear, looked well; fo free confent was given to Mr. Hackit, together with a hint, that delays might prove dangerous ; upon which the young couple took the opportunity of Mr. Homefs being gone out of town in order to meet the parties about the fale of the above mentioned eftate, to fly away in a poft-chaife and

The next day however, She drew courage from her deSpair, and felt a relief in finding herSeif irrevocably doomed to mifery y the die was thrown, and fuS-penSe was at an end. She now determined to perform all the duties of her Ilation with the moll rigid punDuality, hoping that conllant occupation, together v/ith Some degree of enthufiaSm (if Slie Should be able,to attain it) would at lall reconcile her to the rigour

of her fate. In this pious refolution Slie continued Some days, when one morning (lie was called to the parlour; She there found an old Gentleman, who

part of the world for Some years, upon account of a law-fuit which was tried at LoloufeP He then ex-prelTed his furprife at feeing her in a religious habit, faying. My dear child, what could induce you, who had So genteel a fortune, to make a nun of yourfelf ? Alas! Sir, replied the poor girl, you are, 1 find, deceived as much as I have been. No, no, I had no fortune, my father left me none; and that circumftance alone has induced me to renounce a world which I had no means of living in with honour. My God! (cried the Gentleman) who could have told you fuch a falfity } I myfelf am one of the truftees to your father’s will, and know for a certainty, that he left you fix thoufand pounds at his death, which muft be much increased Since that time.

eighteen, or on the day of yoiir mtiT* riage*, and in cafe of your death before either of thoSe periods, the money was to be your guardian’s. She heard no more, but fainted off her chair, and was carried to bed by fome nuns whom the Gentleman rung for, on feeing her fall on the other Side of the grate, where it was impoffible for him to give her any affiftance. I leave you to imagine what were her reflexions on the return of her SenSes. Two or three days Sooner had this man made his appearance. She might have been as happy as She was now v/retched. She implored divine vengeance on the head of her inhuman guardian, then lamented and condemned her too great precC pitation in taking the veil; and in Ihort, was half diftrafted with love, rage, re^ morSe, and deSpair. TheSe paflions were too violent to lafl; flie therefore
after

after Some time fell into a kind of ftupid melancholy^ from which nothing had been found capable of rouSing her, till a young nun who had profelTed Some months before her, called her attention by her unwearied affiduities to comfort and relieve her diftreSs. She had herfelf a tender heart, and was therefore touched at the Sympathising tears which her friend often Shed over her misfortunes. Soothed by her gentle manners and affectionate attendance on her. She at laft unlocked her heart to receive the Sweet balm of friendihip. The ftories of thefe two girls were
t
alike *, both abhorred the convent, and lighed for thoSe pleallires, v/hich, as they were Strangers to them, they fup-pofed were exquiSite. The world they pictured to themSelves as a theatre on Vvffiich afl the aCtors were happy, be-caufe they enjoyed love and liberty.
This

This Iimilitude of talle and-judge^-ment gave birth to a reciprocal friend-fhip between them, which was fote lowed by a mutual confidence in each other, in which they found Some alleviation to their forrows •, when one day St. Agnes (for that, was the name of. our fair fulferer’s friend) told her, that fhe had 'agreed v/ith a young officer, v/ho had long been her lover, to make-
V
her eScape with him *, and ffie now in.-treated her. friend to accompany her^; promising to put her into the hands of her lover, whoSe father,, ffie informed her, was lately dead, immenSsly rich afluring her, .that the young man would, receive her with rapture, and fly to^; Holland immediatelv' with all his trea-Sure, wffiere they would have nothing

And nov/, my dear, every thing will be ready for-our flight at the beginning of next week, when the old wall of the convent (you know) is to be pulled down; it is propped at preSent in Such a manner, that it would be no difficult matter for either you or-1 to pulh it down towards the garden j and for fear any one fhould do So, they are going to repair it. However, we will walk off firft *, but we mull, I believe, be forced to play the hypocrite for the firft day or two of the breach, as we are the youngeft nuns, or we Iliall perhaps be too clofely watched upon the occafion. Let us therefore never approach the wall, nor look at the people, who will enter by hundreds, in order to fee the interior part of a nunnery ; but affect to fliudder at the indecency and impropriety of a convent’s being laid open tq the world in
. fuch

Such a Ihocking manner. The day after this conversation had palled between them, St. Agnes gave her friend a letter from her lover, which confirmed all. Ihe had advanced the day before in his favour; this determined our heroine to follow her friend. Her Ipirits now began to exhilerate, and Ihe, with difficulty concealed from the penetrating eyes of her hfter-nuns, the effeft which the profpe(5t of abandoning them and their houfe for ever, had upon her joyous mind. The important time now approached; the hearts of our fair adventurers beat high with expeftation of love and liberty; when on the morning of that day which they had fixed on for efcaping through the garden, as foon as it grew duflcy, and that the nuns were retired to their cells; on that very day, St. Agnes being fitting at work among all her fillers in the

[	242 ;i
commufiy fell off her ehair in a fit, oc-cafioned (as is fuppoSed) from the too violent agitation which her Spirits had undergone forfome days before.' They cut her lace, threw water in her face, feilt for a.furgeon to bleed her; and in Short, ufed every pofiible means to recover her, but in vain; her foul had taken its flight, and She never Shewed any figns of life from the moment She fell. I Ihall not attempt to defcribe what were the feelings of her friend.
She was conveyed to

O	^
her chamber, where two nuns who constantly watched her, were not Sufficient to hold her *, to Such a degree was her frenzy grown in a few hours. A piece of paper which had fallen out of St. Agnesh boSom, vrhen they unlaced her, let them into the whole contrivance

trivance and deligns of theSe unhappy girls. It was a letter from the officer, fettling all the preliminaries prior-to their intended elopement. All danger was now over from that quarter, as one of the Ladies was dead, and the other raving mad ; in which Hate this unfortunate creature continued for near fix years, at which period of time ffie regained her fenfes, but never either her health or Spirits. My hand aches with writing fo violently that I have hardly power to fubfcribe mySelf, my dear Lady Lucy^ ever yours.

Lady Plum-Jiead then preSented me as a young Lady of birth, merit, and fortune, who was placed under her care and proteflion, on the deceafe of her parents, who were. She Said, her particular friends. My Lady Kelfo hugged me to her breaft, and the old Lord paid feveral very polite compliments to my perfon, and my Lord bowed refpedlfully to Mifs Neville. As my father is an older peer than LadyIanfs, She frequently forgets herfelf, and is pushing me into the room before her, when I am obliged -to pinch her, in order to make her recoiled; that I am her inferior. I admire the lituation of. this houfe, Julia ; it is romantic,
beyond description :

The other day after dinner I went up to the harpflchord, but finding it locked, was quitting it; when Lord Kelfo Said, why, Augujlus^ what are you aboutgive the key of that inftrument to the muSe, who v/ants to play upon it, and who will, I am perfuaded, fliew that She excels in muSic, as Ihe does in every thing

You know, my dear, that I am rather vain of my mulical talents, fo I inftantly began to play and fmg a, favourite air in one of the new operas. The old peer (who is, I find), a great admirer of mufic, liflened to me with a pleafed attention;

and when I had done, he exclaimed. Heavens, ’tis very lucky for me that I am not five-and-twenty! for if I was, you would infallibly turn my head, MiSs Neville., you are Such a Syren. I bowed my thanks, when he deSired his Son to accompany me with the flute j he fetched it immediately, and (to fay no more than the truth) we formed an agreeable concert between us. The old Nobleman appeared in raptures during the performance, and when it was over, he declared that it was too much for one woman to poffefs fuch beauty, talents, and merit, as I did ; adding, that any one of the three would have been fufficient to have made all mankind my flaves. Lady Kelfo laughing, faid, “ a truce

What a happy “ man m.uft he be who can obtain her heart; but perhaps her affedlions are already engaged, and if So, Au-gufius is let into the Secret, and that is the reaSon why he appears inSen-fibie to the charms of So lovely a girl; for I cannot conceive it pofli-ble to look at her with indifference.

Am extremely rejoiced to hear that your LadyShip is at lafb arrived in London., becauSe I am at lead: a great deal nearer to you now than I have been for Some months paft. I long to fee you, but my mother’s illneSs confines me entirely to her chamber. The bad Succefs which my father and hufband have had in their purfuit of Julia., has greatly contributed to the increaSe of her diSorder; befides, Georgds behaviour is a Source of for-row to her, which I much time will ever be able to heal: She loved our fair friend with a maternal affe6lion, and to have loll one child

We expeft our hulbands in England almoll: every hour, as they write, that by a ftrange fatality, they can learn no more news of the fweet Sufferer than if Ihe had never put her feet on the French Ihore \ George continuing to deny the having any knowledge of her place of abode. What a heart muff he have, thus to afflicSt a whole family merely to Save himSelf ? We have now, I think, nothing to hope for, but that chance may put it in the dear girl’s power to inform us herfelf of her litu-aticn, and how Ihe can be relieved from it.

that Some of his efSedls were conSigned to him and Mr. Wilker •, that for his own part, he Ihould bring over in die fame bottom with himSelf about twenty thouSand pounds in plate, jewels, money, and merchandize. “ He then gives me a minute account of all he is worth, how and where placed, left, fays he, I fhould die on my

lince he was buried. As foon as I

could recover mySelf from the allo-nifhment this piece of news had thrown me into, I alked Wilker if he knew where the MiSs Macallens were ?

Sir, replied WiU ker., I was amazed, after his deceafe, to find neither will or papers of any fort, which could let me into the Hate of his affairs; “ and as to money, I was obliged to fell his cloaths to defray the expences of his funeral, which was a handfome one to be fure ; and for effeds, I had none of his in my hands at the time of his death, not a fhilling, I affure you. Take care. Sir, anfwered I, in an anr

He looked, I thought, during our conversation, a good deal alarmed at my menaces, which I was refolved to have effe6lu-,ated when I heard he had cut his own throat; having left all he was worth (which by his will at lealb appeared inconliderable) to an old wretch, who had lived with him Some years in the double capacity of houSe-keeper and miftrcSs •, her name is TVilmot.^ She has a brother who calls himfelf Fletcher^ and whom no body knows, or by what means he contrives to live. I have indeed been told that he had connexions with Some worthleSs woman of fortune, who Supported him •, but that’s probably not true, as I think. Madam, (looking at Mrs. Hackit) you told me
G 4
that
'' i
[ 88 ]
that he is gone off with Mrs. Wilker, as fhe now calls herSelf. Here the Gentleman ceafed Speaking, when I afked Mrs. Hackit if She had any proSpedt of recovering part of her late father’s fortune ? She anfwered, I owe to that Gentleman’s probity and gene-rolity a large Sum of money, which my father had (fortunately for me) in-trufted to his care. Mr. Worth (for that, faid Ihe, is the Gentleman’s name with whom you have been talking, Lady Lucy) is now perfedlly convinced that I am really the daughter of his deceafed friend; and has in cpnfequence made over to Mr. Haokit (after having taken care of me, in cafe I Ihould be fo unfortunate as to lofe my hufband) the fum of thirty thou-EA pounds, which was placed by him, in my father’s name, in the bank. This money,together with what we have
discovered.
/
[	89	]
discovered, to have been placed in the hands of Some Dutch merchants, will make me a conliderable fortune. The finding mySelf thus unexpedtedly rich (continued Mrsi Hackit) would give me very little pleafure, but from the joy I feel in preSenting it to the worthiefi: of men,and bell of hufbands; hewould not abandon me when he thought me a beggar, though urged to it by his unfeeling parents : I tried both his love and probity to the utmoll, by concealing from him the circumftance of my having fecured my jewels till his return from Ivy Caftle. Judge then. Lady Lucy., Laid Ihe, what mull be my joy in being able thus to recom-pence the man I love better than my^ Self, and to whom I owe every blelL ins: in life. Hackit looked as if he
O
had a mind to get up and kifs her, but he contented himSelf witte thanking
t 9° 3
ing her with a nod and a Smile, which were full as expreflive of his Sentiments as if he had Spoke. I now alked Mrs. Hackit how her lifter did ? She replied with a Sigh, “ Ihe was pretty well when I laft heard from her. Madam,

This circumftance made me pafs moft nights in my cloaths. prived of a candle will doubtlefs appear a thing of little importance to you, my dear 5 but it was a matter of real affiiftion to me.

This circumllance was not (you may imagine) calculated to enliven my ideas : I often wept myfelf almoSl blind during the night, but affedted an air of chearfulneSs and eaSe during the day. I objedted to nothing they impoSed upon me, nor expreffed the leak dif-like to any body or any thing in the houSe. By this condudt I perceived I ■became to be lefs narrowly watched ;

About
[	196 ]
About a year before her death,my father had taken into his compting-houSe an Englijh lad, whole name was Fletcher % he was about nineteen years of age, and of a handfome figure, but his mind was corrupt,, he being a perfe6t libertine both in pra(5lice and principles. His father kept a livery liable in Lon^ don. This young fellow had never attracted my notice during my mother’s life, but after her death he and I were frequently left alone together of an evening, when my father (after the buSmefs of the day) ufed to go and relax himfelf a little among his friends. Thus expofed to his addreffes and importunities, Fletcher took advantage of my youth and weakneSs, and, in fhort, ruined me. We carried on our criminal correspondence for near two years, without ever being fuSpedled by my father, who about that time
was
,	[	197 ]
was Seized with a Stroke of the dead palSy, which took him off in a few days. I was his heir. An uncle of mine fettled all my father’s affairs for me; which, when finifhed, he told me, I was worth fix thouSand pounds under his guardianfhip during my mi-
nority
Not long after this.
Mr.
Macallen arrived at Frankfort, upon what occaSion I have forgot, though I
O ^	O

I could not marry him till I vras one-and-twenty *, and, his time of appren-ticefliip being out, he intended to re-

[ 198 ]
turn to England, having no depend-ance but on his father. I believe he would willingly then have made me his wife, could he have Secured my fortune; but had I died under age, he never would have had a fix-pence of it, and if I lived till then, we had no proSpect of any thing but poverty and dillreSs in the interim. I confulted Fletcher upon my uncle’s propofal; he advifed me by all means to accept of the offer, faying, we can furely deceive your hufband, my dear, as weir as we did your father; befides, confider that you may riot perhaps meet with another Englijhman for your purpofe; and in that cafe, we have no chance of meeting again for fome years
at leafl, if ever. This consideration
• %
made me comply with my uncle’s re-queif. Mr. Macallen found me very conformable to his wifhes, fo that in a

decent time we were married.
Some weeks Spent at Frankfort^ my h-ulband propoSed'our going to Eng--land; I readily agreed to it^ as Fletcher was gone thither a fortnight before, and I longed to follow him. We had contrived to have frequent meetings, however, during the time he ftaid town after my marriage. In fhort, Mr. Mac alien and I came to England; I gave notice of out arrival to my iov-
O	m
er j he found means of feeing me in Lbndm., tho’ feldom, and with great
difficulty. As a foreigner, I was very remarkable; belides, I was totally unacquainted with the place, fo that We found ourSelves much more retrained than we had been at Frankfort.
My hufband, about a year after we came to England^ informed me that he was appointed Governor of Madrafs in the Eafi-Indies. I tfem-

bled at the thought of being feparated from the man I loved. He promiSed, however, in order to make me eaSy, that he would uSe his utmoft endeavours to get named a writer for the Eafi-India company at the fame place; and that if he fucceeded, he would follow me as-quick as poffible. This ■profpeft afforded me Some confolation. I hated Mr. Macdlen, he was much older than I, and had a ferious referv-•ed manner, which difgufted me; yet he was tender of, and kind to me, to an excefs ; nor could I (with juftice) complain of any part of his behaviour ; but I dilliked him originally, and con-fcious of the injuries I daily did, I grew to have an averlion for him. So true it is, that we never pardon thoSe whom we wrong. The violent paffion I Hill retained for Fletcher contributed not. a little to the rendering
my
I. 201 ]
my hulband disagreeable to ‘me^ The fatal hour which was to tear me from England arrived at iaft, and I was con--dufted on board of an Indiaman^ bound for Madrafs. I had ta,ken an alFeDionate leave of, my lover the day before my departure *, his dear image employed all my thoughts, till extreme ficknefs obliterated his., as well as all other ideas, from my mind. I expesfl-ed I Ihould die every minute. Ah! why did I not ? I Should then have been •faved from becoming acceiTary to the moll horrid of crimes.
We arrived at Madrafs^ where my huSband took the name of Homes., not chuling to be thought an Irtjhman^ in order to give no oiFence to the inhabitants of the place, who, it Seems, have a paritcular diflike to that nation. About ten months after my arrival in Indiny I found myfelf with
child.
/
/
[ 202 ]
.child, and was in due time brought to bed of a girl: The next year I had another. The birth of theSe children gave my hulband the utmoft pleaSure, and attached him (if polTible) Hill more tenderly to me. On my part, I grew to dillike him leSs; the abSence of my lover, without doubt, contributed greatly to this alteration in my fentiments. I now lived, if not happily, yet content. My children were, as they grew up, inftrudted in the pro-teftant religion, contrary either to my opinion or content: But Mr. Homes Was not to be moved by my entreaties, that at lead: one of the girls fliould be
O
allowed to follow the faith of her mother. He taught them carefully their catechifm, hearing them fay their prayers night and morning \ and, in ^ forbid me ever talking to them on the fubjed: of religion, on pain of
his
[	203	]
his utmolfc diSpleaSure, threatening even to part with me Should I diSobey his orders. This manner of proceeding raiSed my refentment, and weakened the affedlion which I naturally had for my children. However, when they were about fix years old, I prevailed on him to let them be Sent to a convent in France for their education, as they could have none where we were j alluring him at the fame time, that I would not interfere in the affair, but leave him to give what inftrudlions he pleaSed with rega-rd to the religion he choSe they Should be brought up in. Mr. Macallen had a notion, that it was a requilite accomplifhment in every woman of any falhion, to Speak French elegantly, which was a great inducement to his conSenting to his children’s going to France: Belides, he had two lifters wdio were bred up
in



[	204 ]
in convents, and yet continued to b rigid proteftants; So that I really believe, he thought there was leSs danger of their being perverted in a nunnery than with me. He, however, wrote politive orders to the nuns, that the girls Ihould preServe their own mode of faith, and not be obliged (on any pretext whatfoever) to attend the fer-vice of the church of Rome. This convention, I knew. Signified nothing, and was v/hat they neither could or would comply with whatever promiSes they made, embark for France with pleafure, and felt not the lead: regret at parting with them. Soon after this event I received a letter from Fletcher.^ informing me, that at laft he had got leave to come to India as a free merchant. My heart bounded with joy at this news. He arrived; when we Soon formed a

I therefore faw the girls

plan for our meetings. Mr. Homts.
either from the good opinion he had conceived of my condudl, or from inattention, I know not which. Shewed no ciiriolity to be informed how I dif-poSed of my time. Thus fecure, we grew leSs careful to conceal our intrigue ; when at laft I propofed Fletcher's coming home to me at the hours I knew Mr. Homes would be engaged in buSinefs. He did fo, and we were not fufpefled (as I thought) by any body; when one fatal evening, my gallant being with me, my huSband Surprised us in a Situation which was not equivocal; he looked with contempt and indignation on us both, and without Speaking one word retired. The next day brought me the following epiftle from him.

V	This
[ 207 ]
This letter, inllead of filling ino with remorfe, gave me the moft exta-tic pleafure. I communicated its con-tents to my lover, who was transported at the thought that we were now both rich and free. There were at that time Several Ilrips in the port bound for England: We took our pafiage in one of them, which failed in a few days. During this interval, Mr. Homes behaved in Such a manner, that no body SuSpe(?led what had pafled between us; to me, indeed, he never Spoke, but before company, nor even Saw' me. After my departure, he told every body that I was gone to See my children *, but I found afterwards that the wretch who had betrayed me to my hulband, had not failed of publilhing the adventure to every one who would lillen to her. This creature, it Seems, had watched my Heps and a61;ions for

Be that as it may, Fletcher and I returned to England \ our hearts elated' with joy, and our pockets full of bills, which we received in Specie immediately on our arrival there. I thought it prudent, however, to change my name j I did So, and took his. N^e then made a tour xhvovi^ Holland, France, and a part of Italy. Fletcher loved gaiety and expence *, So that I began to SuSpeD, from the manner he lived in, that he mud: have broke into my capital.

Mrs. JVil-mot (for that was the name of WilkeF% maid, wife, or miftrefs, for I was dubious which of thefe titles belonged to her, perhaps all in their turns) informed her brother of this news, adding, Mr. Wilker feems very bufy upon the occaSion, but I fee no money or bank bills: “ we had, I fancy, better y pollpone our plot till I can learn

(This I did, becauSe I remembered

I then made Fletcher give me under his hand, a promiSe to marry me immediately on Mr. Homef^ deceaSe, as alSo that we three jfhould equally Share the plunder, and that my part Should be entirely at my own dilpo-fal, independent of my future huSband. Things being thus amicahly fettled, we reSolved to get rid of Wilker as Soon he had diSpatched Mr. Homes. The next day Wilmot Sent me word, that the Gentleman lately arrived from Madrafs was juft then dead of an apoplexy. He was interred as privately as poITible, and Mr. Wilker now took

This we did, in, hopes that he would either die of re-morSe, or perhaps deftroy himSelf, and and by that means Save us the trouble. Wilmot purfued this plan So well, that Wilker was almofl; out of his fenfes ; when a friend of the late Mr. Hornes^s called on him one morning; they had a long conversation together, and were

At this news, Fletcher and I flew with joy to the houSe, under pretext of confoling the afflifted widow (for Such Ihe now declared herfelf to be). Her brother prefled me to marry him direftly, * fearing, I fuppofe, that I Ihould play them a trick, by proving my right to my late hulband’s effefts, and fo leave ' them in the lurch, as he had formerly done me.

Fletcher gave me my jewels one day, which Mr. Homes had brought from Btdia with him, and for which I wrote an acknowledgment, as I poflelled them only in part of payment of my Ihare in the plunder: they were valued at ten thouSand pounds, fo I gave a receipt for that fum. We now began caution fly to tranfport every thing we had of value (except my jewels) abroad, purpoling, wheii all was removed, to leave England burSelves, for fear that time and linforefecn events might discover our crimes, and bring us to punifhment, when my daughter arrived.

I was determined, however, to Secure the girl bread before I left England', and in conSe-quence procured two men of very different ranks and characters to make their propoSals to her, which in point of money were really advantageous ones; but Ihe refuling both with diS-dain, I foreSaw that the prejudices of her education were not to be eradicated, and that the Subduing of her virtue (if practicable) would take up more time than I had to Spare,^ So I

In Short, chagrined, I fuppoSe, that ten thoufand pounds had thus efcaped him, he determined to Secure the reft, for which reafon he and his Sifter went off together.
Fortunately I had by me bills on the bank for upwards of two thoufand pounds, which, in their hurry to be gone, they had probably forgot,. or elfe perhaps they would not have left them behind. I now reviewed my paft conduct with deteftation and horror, and owned the juftice of Providence in having deprived me of that

Heaven, in pity to' her innocence, has turned the inftru-ments intended for her deltruftion, into the means'of procuring her (in all probability) a lafting happineSs. On hearing from a woman of my ; quaintance, at whoSe houSe Mr. and Mrs. Hackit lodged in town, that they were happy in each other, I put an advertisement into the papers, hoping by that means to become acquainted with my children ; determining at the fame time to do all in my power to render them Service, as a Small atonement for the evils I had brought on them.

After having obtained his liberty, which was on Julia and his brother’s arrival in Englandy he went towards the South of France^ for the benefit of his health, which, it Seems, was much impaired by disappointment, and a prifon. He was not naturally, you know, of the moil gentle disposition, and his crimes (I won’t call them misfortunes) upon reflexion had not contributed much to the fmoothing of his temper j fo that going into a coffee-houSe one day at BourdeauXy he heard a French officer
talking of the Englijh nation.

people, who, though they enjoyed
every bleffing under heaven,, yet were

Since Scoundrels were never known to be brave. This fired George) (as indeed it would have done any man); he defired to have an explanation of the words, villain and Scoundrel. Upon which,
by
[■ 232	]
m
by way of reply, the officer related the ftory of him and Julia to the whole company, who were all of opinion, that the perpetrator of Such a piece of cruelty and injuftice, to a young Lady of character, birth, and fortune, and his father’s ward too, merited the gallows. George quitted the coffee-room, in what temper I leave you to imagine; and the next morning Sent a' challenge to the officer, who accepted it. They fought, and George was killed on the Spot. I am not Sorry for his death, he de-ferved it; befides, I Should always have lived in terror, left he Should have done either Julia or his brother Some miSchief. Add to this confider-ation, that his deceaSe has been of lingular Service to my friend, for now Harry being Sole heir to his father’s eftate, the Chancellor has g-iven his ^onSent to the match. Mr, Boothhy
infills

inlifts that the ceremony Ihall not be deferred on account of George's death,
he was no relation of his :
laying.
However, Mrs. Boothhy feels he was, and on her account they will poftpone their nuptials for a Short time; and then this deServing and ' amiable pair are to be united, with the approba-
