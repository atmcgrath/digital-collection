My grandfather was the leventh S^n of
a gentleman of an ancient family, who was possessed of a Small estate upon the verge of the valley of Glencoe, in Ar-gyleshire, which his ancestors had enjoyed for more than five hundred years : three of his eldest Sons had gone into the army ; two lerved in the navy ; one had studied divinity, and enjoyed a benefice in the kirk of Scotland ; and my grandfather at the age of* thirteen was Sent to the college of GlaS-cow, where he studied the theory of phy-Sic, and at the Same time Saw the pradical part of it in the shop of a Surgeon and apothecary. He staid at Glalcow leven years,

■at the end of which time he v/as tolerably well Skilled in his profeshon, and was Sent for home by his father; the week after his arrival wa*s Spent in vifiting his relations; and among others, his father went with him to the houSe of his coufin Macdonald, the laird of Glencoe; this vifit happened in the month of February, 1692, at the very time that Campbell of Glenlyon was at the houSe, and my grandfather, (as my father has often told me) Saw his aged fire dragged down stairs by his hoary locks, and stabbed by the inexorable Glenlyon; my grandfather, being young and adive, disarmed one of the mercilels butchers, who was upon the point of putting a period to his life, and though the ground was covered with Snow, walked to Inverary. He remained a week at the houSe of a perSon ■who had formerly held a large farm under his father, and was by him furnished with money and other neceffaries for his journey to GlaScow, from whence he had^determi-ned in his mind to embark in the first ship bound to any part of Am.erica; esteeming it better to li^e where fiavery was authorised by law, than to continue in a place v/here his life was at the mercy of Savages and barbarians : he was not long at GkS-
cow, before he found an opportunity of going

They lost fight of land the iith day of March, 1692, and came TO an anchor in Kingston harbour the 2otk of May following ; during the voyage, my grandfather had endeavoured to ingratiate himSelf with captain Rudder, and Succeeded So well, that by his interest Soon after his arrival he got an establishment as ma-?nager and docstor of a plantation, belong-, ing to a gentleman then in England, with leave to .pradlice all the branches of the medical art, within five miles of the houSe-He was young, plump, and had a ssorid 'Complexion, which last being an uncommon circumstance in thole torrid regions, got for him the appellation of the hand-Some Scotch dodtor: among many others he charmed the only daughter of a neighbouring planter, one Nicholas Jacklbn, a Mustee * ’Squire, who was possessed of a plantation well stocked, and capable of making two hundred hogsheads of Sugar, cQmmunihm annis., called Black-Rock, and fituated about forty miles to the west of

Kingston : to be brief, notwithstanding the difference of birth and complexion, my grandfather married the tawny heireSs, Soon after had the plantation left him by Mr. Jackfon, and in about five years buried his conSort, by whom he had issue only one child, namely, Roger Grant, my father; when my father was Seven years old, my grandfather died of an apoplexy Suddenly, two years after which my father was Sent to .Scotland for his education, and acquired a tolerable share of School learning, at the high School at Edinburgh; when he was Sixteen he returned to Jamaica, at the deSire of his guardians, v/ho were willing that he should See what he had to depend upon : he had not been there above a year, before he fell violently in love with the third daughter of one Mr. Adams, a gentleman of Imall fortune, whoSe perSon v/as agreeable, comparitively Speaking : for if a woman, who may be reckoned a great beauty in that Scorching abode, was to be transported in an instant by Some magic art to a temperate climate, she would be placed at the fag end of beauties, or among the least ugly of the ugly : her my father without difficulty obtained, and lived with her for many -years in the utmost-conjugal harmony and affedtion; they had three
children.
( 5	)
children, nam^y, Humphrey the eldest Son, Jeremiah the Second, and Judith an only daughter.
My Sather was a man of grave deportment, taciturn, and had an excellent heart, but was distinguishable by no charadleristic more than his kind affedlion for my mother: he was generally esteemed by his neighbours, and oSten referred to by them, to determine any little difference that might arife in their affairs, he was not devoid a-la~ Creoley of his share of indolence, but contrary to the uSual bent of perSons of his .country, an enemy to dreSs. , His stature was above the middle Size, and he uSually wore when he was dressed, a brown or blue grograrn coat, double breasted, a white waistcoat, double breasted, a pair of thin thread stockings, plain shirt. Square toed shoes, and a pair of round stiver buckles, about an inch diameter, a grizzle unpowdered brigadier v/ig, which uSed to hang i-ipon a peg in the hall, defended from the ants and other vermin, by a double circle of chalk, and which when it graced it’s ^ master’s head, was covered with a Superlatively large brim hat ; to which if you add a beard that grew half way down his waist, you will have a complete representation of my fatlicr’s figure. His fingers'
B 3	were
( 6 )
were .distorted by the gout, which he had brought upon himlelf by a free courle of life, during his youth, and the large potations of madeira and rum punch, he uSually took from his Calabash*, contributed in no degree to correct the peccant chiragrical humour.
My mother was not ent^owed with the strongest natural parts, and was very remarkable for her ■ partiality towards me, her honey Jerey, as she always called me and as remarkable for an unnatural aversion she had unjustly taken against my eldest brother Humphrey, from his earliest infancy ; she was vindidlive and passionate ; but in her intervals of dilpassion, rather good-natured, as most pajffionate people are ; in fine, she Was a thorough bred strongly rivetted in thoSe negroish habits, which me had contradted in her youth ; and as to her figure, she was rather tall, and of a full habit, but made up of unSolid flesh, pretty near of a confistency with blancmange ; in a word, she was a West-In-dian, and perfedtly indolent: her fits of paf-lion were often a^aged by my father’s pacific disposition ; she uSually wore a linnen

night-gown^: a great white handkerchief to cover her neck, a mob tied with a pink, fattin ribbon under her chin, green stocky ings with red clocks, and mens shoes, which last article of herdrels she constantly wore, to prevent the chiggers from getting into her feet; as she was a great doftreSs and much among the Negroe houfes, the keys of the stewards room and other out houSes, uSually hanging by her fide in an iron ring,.
My brother Numps was Sent to Scotland by the time he was eight years old, but my mother was lb excessively fond of me, that she could not bear the thoughts of parting with me; my father had many disputes, with her upon that Subjedt; why, my dear, he would often fay, your fondneSs is cruelty to the child; for aught I know he may go on in this way, followed by Qua-sheba till he is twenty : Reader, Quasheba, you must know, was the negroe wench that Suckled me, and constantly attended •me from the time of my birth. My dear, she would often. anSwer, in a drawling tone, honey, Jerry is but twelve years old, and you know it’s a weakly babe, and fubjedl . to the fever; he shall go to England, v;hen he is old enough : my father v:as daily entreating that I might be Se.nt to Europe;

and when 1 was about Sourteen, one afternoon I was called by a negrce girl to my mother’s bed-chamber; she was lying upon the bed, under a mussdtto set, and Sour negroe girls, viz. one at each hand, and one at each foot, her shoes being pulled off, who, as is the custom in that country, were tickling their reSpedfive members with their fingers, to encourage a propenSity people always have, particularly in hot weather, to Sleep after dinner; as Soon as I entered the room, come hery, honey, Jerry, Said she ; accordingly I lifted up the mus-kitto net, and approached ; your papa, continued she, has reSolved to fend you to lingland very Soon ; you go to London, not to Scotland; I am Sorry to part with ■you, but you know his for your -good, and that you can never be a great man, unleSs YOU have a little learning. She clung
V	o	o
about my neck, and melted into tears; I was very much affedted as well as my mother, and we both would have shed many more tears, had we not been interrupted by my father, who came in with a letter in his hand, which he had just received from his town agent, informing him that he had Spoken to captain Stephen Rudder about my passage.

The ship was to Sail as loon as my Sea store, could be laid in ; which was to con« fist of forty geeSe, as many turkeys, four hundred fowls and ducks, twenty hogs, twenty sheep, fifty dozen of bristol water, bananas, plantains, aligator pears, and pine apples innumerable, and for my own private consumption, a large proviSion of Sweetmeats, ^tamarins, ginger, cashew nuts, yams. Sweet potatoes, and So forth; at which, as you may eafily imagine, a certain perSon, named Stephen Rudder, was not diSpleaSed ; for it is uSual to leave what remains of the Sea store at the end of the voyage, to the Captain, and, consequently, the greater that remainder is likely to be, the greater is the alacrity of the captain in accepting of a passenger. Stephen Rudder, however, was not adluated Solely by an interested motive in accepting of me as a paS-lenger to London, for fince the time of hrs father John, my grandfather’s patron and benefadtor, our family had always endea-r, voured to Serve the Rudders ; which made him glad of an opportunity of shewing that he was Senfible of the obligations he had
O
received, by taking all possible care of me during the voyage. It would require the pencil of a Reynolds to paint the affedling Scene of my mother’s taking her -farewei

of me; in short it was with dishcutly that I was parted from her. Let a fond mother place herSeif in my mother’s fituation, upon the point of being parted from a favourite child for many years, during which tirne he w^s to be entrusted to the management and Sole dircftion of a Sugar fadfor, and poffibly to be regarded by him in the fame light as the produce of a plantation; let her imamne what must be the feelings of my mother upon this melancholy occafion. As I was mounting my horSe to proceed to the ship, I was accosted by the whole- gang of my father’s negroes, who gave me a shout of leave in their plaintive and Savage tone.

“ more diligent in my studies,” He took his leave by a tender parental embrace^ and
left me to the care of Rudder, attended by my faithful (^uasheba, who was charged by my mother never to Sail giving me goat’s milk chocolate every morning ring the palSage, there being a goat-IcuC on. board for that purpole ; it would be te^-dious to enumerate the different instru(fH -ons Quasheba had given her relating to mf healthj dreSs, See. on the voyage. .
On the first of June, 1740, we Sailed,, and being a fingle ship, which went tolerably well, Gonfidering she was Sugar loaded, beat up through the windward-passage; captain Rudder was a thorough-bred Sailor, a man of few words, Superstitioussy affecst*-ed, like many of his fraternity, by an accidental v/histle or the flying of a bird; but ^ understood the pradlical part of bis buss-neSs well enough to condudt a vessel from Jamaica toGreat-Britain; he was, moreover, honest, and generally good-natured; hii honesty was impeachable in one instance only, which is the more pardonable, as it is frequently pradlifed by people of his eai* ling, and reckoned a venial fault; I mean the destruistion of Several turtle, which he had promised- to deliverLondon—-by his dishonesty I fared the better; it ill bceomes

me therefore to mention it, which I should not do, was I not under a necessity, as a biographical writer, of concealing no momentous occurrence, that I was an adlor in. Whenever he ordered the cook to dreSsone, it is eaSy, he would fay, to tell them “ it died a natural death”. Many of thole we did not eat, instead of being delivered to the owners, were brought, I verily believe, to a good market in London.
There w'as a particularity in our captain that I could not help taking notice of, and whether it proceeded from a con-ciouSneSs of his own ignorance, or from a defire remarkable in Some, of malting mysteries of trifles, I will not pretend to determine; but he was always extremely backv/ard in anSwering any questions which were alked him, relating to matters in his profession ; when I aflced him how far we were from England, or when we should be in I'ounctings, he always had the fame laconical anSwer ready ; I’ll land you Sate 1 warrant you. Nothing remarkable happened during the passage.
■ On the fifteenth of August Lwas landed at the Tower stairs, and walked v/ith the captain to Mr. Ballance’s compting-houSe, in Mark-lane, and Mr. Ballance then being at his country-houSe at Clapham, Mr.
Hanlon,
t
( IJ )
Hanlon, his clerk, gave the captain a receipt, acknowledging my SaSe arrival in London.
Mr. Ballance having only a counting-houSe and a room over it where his clerk lay, went every day aSter change to Clap-ham, where his family constantly refided ; it being too late to go out of town that evening, I was bedfellow to Mr. HanSon; the next morning, about ten, Mr. Ballance ' - came to town. He was a man of near Sixty years of age, low of stature, had a roman noSe, two little grey eyes, and uSually had on a dark grizzle full-bottom’d perriwig, his coat the colour of Spanish Snuff, waistcoat, breeches and stockings ditto, which he wore from ceconomy, as he conSumed a large quantity of that commodity, and which would have injured cloaths of any other colour : his complexion was pretty near of the Same colour as his drefs, only a shade or two lighter ; he was of a Sordid and griping diSpofition, and had got a considerable share oS the confignment bu-SineSs, by advancing very largely for the planters, which is almost a certain method of being employed by them ; for Some, from extravagance, others, from a defire of encreafing their posseffions, they are almost all in arrears to their merchants in London :

don: Mrs. BaHance had been a fortune ih Jamaica, and had railed her hushand from the honourable employment of a mill-carpenter ; she was a perfedt cypher in life, affedted by no deSire but that of having a child, for which she and her huS-band, I dare fay, frequently, though unsuccessfully, prayed : being equipned with proper cloaths which were bought readymade, two days after I had been at Clap-ham, having Seen the lyons in the Tower, and the wax-work, I was lent off to a boarding-School, kept by Mr Concord, a clergyman that lived in a village upon the banks of the Thames, distant about fen.^ miles from London ; his School confisted of fifteen Scholars, twelve of whom were Creoles of the different issands, under the^ ; care of Mr. Ballance, who was Concord’s patron and friend.
I was initiated in the art of reading by my master’s wife ; to whoSe Sole diredlion I was committed for the first twelve months, after I was put to School; different, I would often ressedf, was my condition here, from what it had been in Jamaica ; there I had twenty staves ready to sty at my nod ; here I was the dunce of the Icbool, the tool and minister of every boy and every fer-, vant; I had no mother to take my part:
the
( '5 )
1
the oppression and tyranny exerciSed upon me would have been inSupportable, had I not gained the good-will of one JohnSon, the most reSpedlable boy in the School, both upon account of his bodily, as well as mental accomplishments; which I acquired by my Submishon and civil deportment towards him. He was a native of Barba-does, had been bred the former part of his time at Winchester; but his father being obliged, from pecuniary motives, to employ Ballance, JohnSon was by him removed from Winchester to Concord’s ; he came there a remarkable good Scholar for his standing, and was made to Supply the place of an usher; his friendship I found Servi-ceable, and therefore cultivated it with assiduity ; and I shall ever remember him with gratitude ; as the little knowledge I am master of, I am indebted to him for : Con-cord gave himSelf very little trouble about the progreSs we made in our education; he employed himSeif for the most part in fchool-time in mending his stockings ; just before the holy-days he would advance us into higher books : Johnfbn often uled to tell me, that Ballance and Concord were tvro villains; and that Mr. Han-Sbn had discovered to him an engagement they had entered	which he
would
\
( )
would expoSe as Soon as he went frorn School; it was no leSs than an agreement, that Concord should give Ballance a receipt for each boy’s board under his care, for twenty pounds a year, whereas, in fadt, he was to receive only fifteen ; and he was, in ,confideracion of the above connivance, to have all the Creoles under Ballance’s care, placed at his School : when this matter appeared, my Surprize at Concord’s negled; of us was very much lessened.
JohnSon was a lad of a noble and generous way of thinking, and therefore took every occasson of expofing the meanneSs of .theSe associated Scoundrels; the negledl of ,our education was exceeded by nothing .more than the pedagogue’s avarice and ra-paciouSneSs ; he almost starved us, and by way of comfort, v/ould harangue by the hour, upon the advantages of fasting and Self-denial. I was, however, v/ith regard to this article, luckier than most of my companions, as my mother often Sent me money and Sweetmeats, all which I appropriated to my corporal Subfistence.
When we went to Ballance’s in the holidays, our commons were increaSed, but v/e were excluded from the honour of his company, and Sate in the kitchen, where we always dined, except on Sundays; a circumstance
#
( i; )
cumstance, which mortified our West-In-dian pride not a little. Our Sundays evenings were always employed in reading the bible and Sermons : “ I love the Weshln’ “ dies, Ballance would Say, and should have “ staid there till now, but really they have “ Ib little religion, that one may as well “ live among Turks and Pagans; here, he “ would continue, I have an opportunity “ oS gratiSying my religious Servency; “ here, I may go to church two or three “ times a week.” Our evenings in the Christmas, Sundays excepted, were employed at playing at whist; JohnSon and the cook, commonly held the coachman and mySelf, the three-legged stool Supplying the place of a more elegant card-table ; my partner at whist was likewiSe my associate in bed, and the ^gentle reader may eafily conceive, that my morals received great advantage from his pure and virtuous conversation.
When we were to go to School, our guardian uSed to give us pocket money, purSuant to the diredtions of our parents, and distributed to each a Sum proportionate to his ag;e ; and thoSc who were old enough to receive gold, always had guineas or half guineas given them confideraWy under weight, which he got from his banker, be-
;	'	ing
( i8 )
ing allowed a diScount Sor the deficiency;; this was told us by Mr. Hanlon; we were young, and thought it better to take light money rather than none. The condudl of our Schoolmaster was of a piece with that of our guardian in the large muldls he iiied to impoSe on us, for the faults we committed, not ib much for our benefit or improvement, as for his private emolument. When he detedled any of us in robbing an orchard or garden, or committing Such Ibrt of thefts as are pradliSed by Ichool boys, be would fay, “ It is no wonder, that you “ Creoles are thieves and robbers, you are “ all descended of felons and rebels.” One day, when he uttered a Speech to this import, addressed to Johnlbn, “ Sir, (he replied) “ if you had given yourSelf the “ trouble to read or enquire, you would “ have known; that if a ship, with a fingle “ felon, was to come to an anchor in any ‘S bay in Barbadoes, she would immediate-“ !y be funk by the fortConcord denied the truth of the assertion ; Johnlbn affirmed, it with greater warmth -, he was again con^ tradiisted and infulted; and, at last, enraged , to that degree, that he levelled his AinSworth’s didbonary at the pedagogue’s, head, which knocked him backwards in his chair, and deprived him of two of his
fore
/
( *9 )
fiw*e teeth.—--The indignity was too great to be put up with.; he went to Ballance; bad his wounds-Speak for him, and prevailed upon his brother in iniquity to take away the offender; which- was the more eafily effedled, as JohnSon would, at all events, have gone to Leyden the holidays Sollow-ing.

Finding there was likely to be an end of my days of joy, by the removal of my protestor and benefaAor, I wrote to my father, defiring that he would fend for me over. There were two other Creoles that I became intimate with; one of which, named Jacobs, a Kittifonian* by birth, got into my good graces, by teachr ing me the back-fword, or, in more hurn-ble language, to play at cudgels: the other was a native of Montfcrrat, named Stephens j the greatest part of our time was employed in this exerciSe, in which I at last became So expert, that there was hardly my equal to be found : In the holidays, Baf-lance’s Servants, and the barber of Clap-ham, felt the weight of my vidtorious arm.

After Johnibn leSt School, what from an additional moroleneSs and acrimony, which Seemed to grow upon the pedagogue, and from the cravings of an appetite, which in growing boys is voracious, I found my life more diSagreeable than ever. One day, in a gloomy mood, I propoSed a Scheme to Jacobs, which he immediately approved of: “ Here, Jacobs, (Said 1) we are Spend-“ ing our parents money to no purpole, starved by our School-master, and neg-“ ledted by our guardian, who looks upon “ us like So many hogsheads of Sugar; let “ us go down to Falmouth, and embark in “ the packet for the West-Indies, which “ will carry us both to our homes.” A good Scheme, replied Jacobs, but where’s the cash for our journey “ Why, (Said 1) “ let us Save our allowance, and Scrape all “ the money we can together, for fix “ months,wiiich will be enough to bear our, expences to Falmouth; as to our passage, we may work it over.”
The intermediate Space between our Setting out, and the time the Scheme was first propoSed, was employed in perfecting our-Selves in our beloved diverSion of cudgels; being pretty lucky in our remittances; and what by borrowing and Saving, we had jaiSed about three guineas a-piece : one
evening
A
( 21 )
evening we got leave of Concord to go to Clapham the day Sollov/ing, which happened to be a holiday, and having packed up two shirts and a pair of stockings a-piecc, at three o’clock in the morning we Set out on foot for Salishury, where we arrived in four days-; we travelled very wide of the diredl road, or we should have got there a day Sooner: as our feet were galled, we took the advantage of the Exeter waggon, or we should otherwise have been obliged to halt a day or two. to recover from our fatigue.
The evening before we reached Exe^-ter, we counted our.stock of money, and found that we had our original fix guineas, minus., eighteen shillings, which as the packet would Sail in a fortnight, we thought Sufficient: we expeded to reach Exeter at ten at night, and at a town about ten miles distant from that city, as it began to grow dark, we took advantage for the confideration of one shilling of a returned post-chaiSe; Jacobs paid the carrier five shillings for our places in the waggon according; to agreement. From Exeter we travelled on foot to Falmouth, which is more than ninety miles, in five days, and were glad to find that we had reached our journey’s end at So little expence. We took up our lodging at a Small:aiehouIc in the outlkirts of

"the town, where we expected to be reasonably accommodated; we now thought it necessary to ballance our account, and fee what we had to depend upon ; when, behold, my friend Jacobs was two guineas short of what we reckoned upon : “ I was ‘‘ always afraid, Jacobs, (Said I to him) that your thoughtlessheSs would bring Some misfortune upon us; you are a good-natured unthinking creature, but “ your negligence will hinder you from ever thriving in the world.” Jerry, he anSwered, this mishap gives me more un-eaSmeSs than it possibly can you; but let us empty our pockets, and try to find th© strayed sheep; our pockets were accordingly turned infide out,, but to no ef^dt, and at last we both concluded, as Jacobs carried his gold and stiver in the Same pocket;, he had given the carrier two guineas insteadi of two shillings, when he paid him in the dark; we comforted ourSelves however with the thoughts that they were two of Ballance’s Sweated ones.

Whereas two young gentlemen., about Um days ago, eloped from fehaol, and have never ibeen heard of Jince \- they are hereby required to return to their guardian-, or to let him know where they are ferreted, and they may ■^end upon his pardon and kind treatment mr the future.
My fellow-traveller agreed with me that we had better beg our bread; than return to, Ballance’s. During our stay at Falmouth, a recruiting^Serjeant and. two Soldiers of the first regiment of guards came to lodge at the inn where we put up; the fer-jeant was a North<-Briton, named Sawney

Our lodging at Falmouth cost us five shillings a week, and our eating and drinking a shilling a day erch ; So that at the end of three weeks, we found that we were five shillings and fix-pence worst than nothing : our Situation was really distrelsful ; without money in our pockets, or a posh-, bility of getting any ; the packet, for aught we knew, not to Sail for a month : in this distressed state we Sauntered about the town, and was put to our ultimate refource, viz. Selling our linnen, by which we raiSed only four shillings : one evening as we were fitting in the chimney corner, distreSs and melancholy painted on our faces, Sawney StevenSon came up to me, my gud freend and countryman. Said he, you stem to be meelancholy; a Heelander should nestr be diSmayed ; this was followed by profesh-, ons of friendship, and offers of his strvices and purst ; his generous proceeding charmed me fo miuch, that in the excels of my joy, at having met with So worthy a man,
I opened my heart, and let him into the fitiiation of our affairs, upon which he immediately forced a guinea upon us ; from this time honest StevenSon and we were inseparable ; one night when opr amity was at its height, Stevenstn propoSed a party

where he purpoied we should dine, and Spend the day together; his Scheme wa« agreed to, and about ten o’clock we Set out: when we had gone a mile, a glaSs gS ratifia was offered us, which we liked So well, that we repeated our draughts; the conversation after this refreshment, grew very lively, in which my friend Jacobs and Jeremiah Grant, engrossed no inconfider’-able part; another round of ratifia was propoSed, and accepted of, the conlequencc of which, was mufick and mirth; Stephen-fon then began to launch out into enco-

miums on the glory of his majesty’s Service, and in short, managed So artfully, that he engaged us to enlist; we had no ;Sooner taken the king’s money, than in our inebriated condition, we were hurried away <to the mayor of Penryn, who happened to be a baker ; and the oaths were forthwith.

administered, without the least Scruple or hesitation. We afterwards learnt, that Ste-phenSon hearing of us at Truro, had come to Falmouth on purpoSe to endeavour to enSnare us. Next day we found Steven-Son’s fawning obSequiouSnels changed into a Supercilious haughtineSs ; but we preferred the discipline of the army to Concord’s flagellation, and Submitted to our Duty without repining. We were lent up
C	to
%
( 26 ) ■
to the Savoy ; and aSter having gone thro’® the drill, and learnt our exerciSe, mounted guard, and went through every other Service in our turns. Now and then a thought of my mother’s unneaifineSs, when she heard of my elopement, would obtrude itSelf upon me; but I purpoSed as Soon as I should he tired of the Army, to diScover mySelf to tny guardian.
I shone in the army shy my Skill in the back-Swordl, as much as I had done at Clapham ; and the month that 1 mounted guard at the Tower, broke So many heads upon Tower-hill, that my fame was trumpeted far and near: the morning that I was to leave the Tower in order to return to SomerSet-HouSe, a Soldier came into the ;guard-room, and told me, that a gentle man wanted to Ipeak to me; he had no fooner turned his back, than old Ballance ;appcared; it would be difficult to fay which was the greatest, my astonishment or con-fuSion. My. guardian was at Some difficulty in obtaining our diScharge, which he at last estedled.
One day, it Seems, when I was exerting ;my {kill on Tower-hill to obtain the valuable prize of a hat, Mr. HanSon, Ballance’s clerk, happened to be in the circle, who, after staring at me a good deal, hardly believe-
( 27 )
lieving his own eyes, reconnoitred me without my perceiving him; he immediately inSormed his master of it, and by that means I was detedled; but beSore we would conSent to be discharged, we made it a condition,.qua non^ that we should never return to Concord’s. As loon as l shad changed my military garb, and made rriySelf a figure fit for the company of gentlemen, Jacobs and naySelf were conduced to Clapham, where we had Letters delivered to us from our parents, which had lain at the counting-houSe for two months ; upon ^thc peruSal of mine, my heart was not a dittle rejoiced to find, that Ballance had received orders to furnish me with a cargoc*' which I was diredted to go over with by the first opportunity : Jacobs was likewife enjoined to return, and he propoSed ta obey the Summons with as little reludtance as I did; my whole time was now taken up in making a proper assortment of goods, *and looking out for a clerk ; and I had the good fortune to find one, of an excellent charadler : he was a young gentleman of a good family in Jamaica, named Eugenio, whole father had died infolvent'; he had an estate of two hundred pounds a year, less: him by an uncle, which he had given up to his mother and fistec, that lived in Ja-
C z	maica.
( I8 )
rhVica, and refolved to shiSt for himlelf by his own industry.
As Stephen Rudder, commander of the 'good ship Centaur, was riding at anchor in the river Thames ; and deSigned to Sail by God’s permission, as Soon as loaded, without convoy ; I reSolved with God’s per-mishon to give him my freight; though insurance was very high, which however was worth my while; as by running it, I should get to Jamaica by the Christmas market: thus had I made a Sudden tranfi-tion from being a common Soldier, to a merchant; having Spent five years in this ifiand, I propofed to reviSit my native .country.
My goods were all on board the first of Odtober by the assiduity of Eugenio ; a week after, the ship cleared out at the cuS-tom-houfe, and fell down the river, and three days after, having a fresh breeze at ' north-east, we very Soon got clear of the land: in leven weeks from our departure w'e made the ifiand of Jamaica : as I had been for So many years abSent from my native place, it is to be SuppoSed that the difference between it, anei the European countries, would strike me in the Same degree, that it would a stranger at his first arrival.
Before
( 29 )
Before we came in with the land, a fisherman’s shallop Sailed up to us, to take thoSe passengers who should be impatient to get on shore ; I agreed with the master to convey me and Eugenio to Kingston : as we were soing I could not forbear con-
O D	/«	•
templating the fingularity of his peribn ' he was at least fix feet five inches tall, and as meagre as the knight of la Mancha ; he had on a white night-cap, white waistcoat, white troulers, and check shirt; his features were strongly marked, and his face and hands adorned with freckles, as large as Spots upon a leopard’s back, he had almost lost the uSe of his hands and feet, by the dry-cholick, a< dilbrder tradted in warm climates, by an immode-i- * rate uSe of new rum ; his voice was drawling and feeble, and his Spirits received the Support they required, by a frequent application to the rum-bottle.
It was noon when we landed, and my first diSgust, occasioned by the appearance of the fisherman, was not a little encreaSed by leveral gentlemen that stood upon the wharf, in the fame attire, except the trou-Sers, and pretty near of the Same complexion as the fisherman ; they were all meagre and languid, and wore white nightcaps, with frills playing in the wind, and
C 3	were
/
( 3^ 1
were encumbered with a Small- rotundity projecting, like that oS a woman that if fix months gone with child ; all their motions were stow and indolent,to that degree,that it was with difficulty they Seemed to move one leg beSore the other; their behaviour how--ever compensated for this misfortune of the* climate^ and their civility and hoSpitality to us, though strangers, effaced the prepoSessi-on that had been formed in our minds . against them ; we accepted the offer of a' gentleman, who pressed us to make ufe of his houSe, ’dll we could get horSes to carry us to my father’s plantation ; in going thte ther, our first antipathy had like to have returned upon us, by the objeCls that pre-lented themSelves in our way; we V7cre conducted through the market-place, which; was filled with negroes, three parts naked, without any distinction of fexes, the Sun darting his perpendicular rays, occafioned » perSpiration to be strong, which produced fuch fragrant effluvia, that the whole air was impregnated with them ; which added to their barbarous and diScordant jargon, formed upon the whole, a feene, fome degrees lest pleafing, than our notion of pa-radiSe is.
When I arrived at Black-Rock, I found
all the family assembled; and the affectionate
( 31 )
j^ate reception my parents gave me;, watr in Some meaSure embittered by the bad charadler Ballance had given me in his letter ; it was in vain that I represented to my Sather, the tyranny of my Ichool-maS-ter, and the villany oS my guardian; my mother was eafily perSuaded oS the veracity oS what I urged in my vindication; and loon pievailed upon my father, to promile that he would forget the past.
The week after my arrival, I received the vifits of above fifty gentlemen, who all dined with me ; our company at a vilit-en-tertainment of this Sort, Seldom conSisted of lels than twenty guests.
The order and regularity obServed in my father’s plantation was delightful, as was likewise my mother’s tcnderneSs and care of the lick negroes; here an adherence to the rules of equity and humanity, rendered the state of ssavery, chance had placed theSe fons of Africa in, happy, and to be'wish’ ed for: each family had a houSe, and a quantity of land allotted to it; which properly cultivated, was Sufficient to nourish them comfortably and well.
A whole day in every week was given them, Sor improving their little plantations, exclufive of a daily allowance of a herring, and. half a pound of corn, to each in-

( 52 )
dividual; by this means their condition ia Jamaica, was infinitely preSerable to that they had been forced from in Guinea ; and • here, courteous reader, whatibever thou art, whether a judge, a colonel, a merchant, or perchance, more probably, a gig-ling miSs in her teens, or who pretends to be in her teens, permit me to animadvert a few things touching this ssavery of the negroes ; why then, miSs, I do lay it down as a certain poSition, that if a negroe has a master of common lenSe, he betters his condition by being Sent to an European colony; .in Africa he lived in a continual'state of war, without any fixed abode, Subjedt to a Superior, fierce and Savage by nature, and a stranger to the feelings of humanity.
In the the colonies it is the interest of the master to treat his stave with humanity, and to feed him well, for he is Sure of a return of fidelity and labour: Some instances there are of a contrary proceeding; but the general pradlice is to uSe them with gentle-neSs. Now, madam, if you are dissatisfied with my argument, pray do you conceive, that I had not rather be a negroe in Jamaica, than your lap-dog or Squirrel ? Or if thou art a judge, and art not convinced by my reasoning, why, Mr. Justice,
- ---1 cannot possibly help it ; but I protest.

test, the condition oS one of my father’s blacks, was to be preferred to that ot one of your tenants in Derbyshire, orGloucester-shire, or Lincolnshire, or ellewhere, who is obliged to keep a wife, and eight children, upon Seven-pence a day. As to you. Son of Mars, pray. Sir, take a walk upon the parade in St. James’s Park, any morning between the hours of eight and twelve. And, finally, if perchance thou art a merchant, Mr. Grant prelents his Compliments to you, and defires you will peruSe the following letter to his father.

.Sir,
This goes per good ship, Jamaica
Planter, Capt. John Staples. I think mySelf in conscience bound to inform you of a tranSadlidn I was privy to, in which you are very nearly interested: You must recoiled!, that about a year ago, you lent Mr. Ballance a commishon to purchaSe five lottery tickets, which he accordingly-bought, and charged them to your account, marking the numbers in the margin of the
C 5	book.
( 34 )
book, which I Set down with my own hand; he had Several opportunities of Sending them to you; but, Sor what reaSon, I was then ignorant, uegleded it; but one oS the tickets happening to come up a 20001. prize, he immediately placed it to his own account, and gave you one of his own blanks in the room of it; I am now out of buSineSs, and have rro motive to bias the veracity of.
Sir,
Your Humble Servant,
Rd. Hanson.
This letter convinced my father, that what I had told him of Ballance’s villainy, was very well grounded.

CHAP. IV.
I Found my eldest brother in Jamaica maried to a lady of Some fortune, who lived upon a Small estate my father had bought with the Savings of his paternal
one 5 the revetfion of which, at my father’s
death,
( 35 )	^
death, was limited to him; it was called High-grumps. He had returned Srom Scotland, fraught with classical learning, and though of lively parts, yet had not the power of making himSelf liked in conversation ; his ideas were generally clouded i by the multiplicity of words he uSed, of which he had a Sort of involuntary fiow;-my father would often Say to him, Numps,. you overflow us with shch an inundation, of verbiage, that a plain man can hardlyr edge in a word; which rebuke Seldom had the effedl of stopping the Deluge; his pe--riods in common conversation were of the' Ciceronian Species, and adorned with many high-flown epithets and he was remarkably fond of what the Romans call fefq^ui-fedalia v£rhat. He was likewiSe fubjeft to ^ a dilbrderv not" uncommon in the preSent times; called the	fcribendi, and was-
engaged in. a literary altercation with the Ipeaker of the asseshbly, whoSe character I shall give the out-lines of in a proper; place.
Numps had imbibed in Scotland a wonderful veneration for the antiquity of his race^ which he often ostentatioussy declared ; in company. ThoSe foibles are peccadillo’s, when the benevolence and humanity
of his disposition are considered, he was
the
( 3^ )
the best of hushands, and the tenderest of parents; his SenSibility, with regard to the misfortunes of his children, was extreme ; while I was at his houSe, his only Son died the day after he was born, and it is impossible to deScribe the grief he felt upon that occaSion, which I cannot better represent, than by giving my reader a copy of the epitaph he wrote upon him, which, at the Same time that it Serves as a Specimen of his pure Latinity, will throw great light upon his charadter.

: When the church-bell began to toll for the interment oS the inSant, he came Suddenly Srom his wiSe’s room, arid, catching me by the hand : “ Brother, Said he, was you a father, and a fond one as I am, “ you would excuSe the heart-felt Sorrow, ‘‘ which, at this instant, environs the gloomy avenues of my troubled Soul, fly quicker “ than the Wind, (adressing himSelf to a “ Negro-boy; and lay my abSolute com-“ mands upon that Minister of diSmal and “ dreary Sounds, to stop his doleful death-“ commemorating hand ; ” in two words he ordered the Sexton not to rino- the bell.
O
Another messenger was immediately diS-patched to Kingston, with the following letter to his Taylor.
Sir,
AS my prelent unhappy Situation, by the death of my only Son and representative, calls aloud for Sable; I conjure you, to Send me a complete Suit of the
most
<
f
/
( ss )
most melancholy habilment of a nodtur--nal dye.	Your Servant,
H UMPHRY Grant. To Mr. Timothy Cabbage,
*'.	O'
Taylor, in Kingston.
My brother’s wife,, Bet, as he always-called her, had fallen in love with his understanding, and the courtship first began by a copy of verfes she wrote in praiSe of him. She had a particular attachment to all people ot Superior understandings ; but to others she behaved with the utmost cool-neSs and reServe, and kept them at a distance with an up-lifted nofe, — naSo fu-perdas adunco, — which, added to an af^dled halt in her gate, drew upon her the following epigram, fuppoSed to be written by one of the Speaker’s creatures:
Grant, they fay, has wit,
And Some have felt it.
She walks as if she was bef—t.
And looks as if she Smelt it.
The Speaker’s plantation bordered upon my brother’s, who, by that means, had a better opportunity of knowing his cruelty and inhumanity, than the generality of people upon the istand.
Me was an Irishman by birth, and had
been
/
V
( 39 )
had been Sold as an indented Servant upon * the head of a barrel of beans, together. with the commodity upon which he was^ placed; but by a steady regard to one only objedl, namely Riches, had amassed a large Sum of money ; his name was Boat, and was lineally deScended from Judge Boat, who is immortalized by an epitaph the facetious dean wrote upon him.
The Speaker inherited many of the wooden qualities of his illustrious ancestor; but as in all countries power follows property. So here Mr. Boat’s vast possessions raiSed him to the Speaker’s chair ; he was of a pragmatic turn, and always shewed a particular deSire to adt as attorney for thoSe persons who were abSent from their estates; and, lastly, his loquacity equalled that of my brother; whether a rivalship in this article, or my brother’s detestation of the Ipeaker’s inhumanity, occafioned the breach that was unhappily opened betwixt them,
I could never learn with any certainty ; but I am inclined to think, that his cruelty was the first occaSion of it; for it was notorious in that part of the country, that the Speaker tiled to drop hot fealing wax upon the faces of his negroes for the Smallest offences, and had more than once forced ordure down
Spme of their throats with his own h^nd,,
" .... -
C 40 )
All his negroes, without exception,' were hamstrung, to prevent their running away. His uSual food was crabs roasted alive, crimpt mullets, or a pig whipped to death.
Having once occaSion to go to Hallifax, in North America, as he was a great devourer oS bceS, he Sent a Sat heifer on board the vessel he had taken his passage in, from the buttock of which he daily had a'steak or tw'o cut, and had the cruelty to let the poor animal walk about the deck with bleeding wounds, that he might gratify a whimSical appetite. To give the finishing stroke to his character, he had been guilty of incest, by efpoufing his first w ife’s mother, for the Sake of a large jointure she cnjoyette, which, as the ecclefiastical law is not in force in any of our colonies, is not amenable to any court there established.
Thele unnatural and barbarous adls excited my brother’s indignation, which he lost no occafion of shewing; whenever he Ipoke in the assembly (which was very frequently) Humphrey was Sure to anSwer him; and Sometimes they went as far as peribnal ressedlions.
My brother once wrote a pamphlet upon the condudl: of a certain commander; as ^ Soon as Boat knew that he was the author of it, he published an anfwer, filled with
. the
( 41 )
the most Icurrilous perSonal invedtives; this naturally created an enmity, which nothing could obliterate, and each strove which could make himSelf the most odious to the other.
At Christmas, when the family assem-bledi which it always did for a week at that time of the year, the Kingston journal was brought to Black Rock, as uSual, on Saturday evening; my brother Numps, having pulled off his patroling * acroutre-ments. Sat down in my father’s eaSy chair to peruSe it; after he had been attentive for affew minutes, he got up, and burst out into the following exclamation I “ Per-“ dition catch the villain’s traitrous foul! “ what, to attack me in fo cruel and in-“ human a way! Barbarian as thou art! “ This indignity shall be laid up in the in-“ most recesses of my foul: Alie mente re-“ pqfitum /” We were all amazed at this extraordinary Speech, which he Soon explained, by defiring me to read a copy of verSes in the paper, which we Ibon discovered to be a burleSque tranflation of the la tin epitaph my brother had written upon his Son, compoSed by his neighbour Boat,
or,
* The militia always patrole at Chrillmas to prevent an infurreflion of the negroes.
( 42 )
OTy more probably, one oS his dependants |r, according to his defire, read as follows::
Beneath doth lye,
OS Humphry Grant,

I hired a store in Kingston, and fold many of my goods at a profit of. three hundred per cent, and entered into the Creo-lian pleasures with the utmost alacrity, the greatest of which was to dine under trees-by the Sea-Side, upon turtle or barbocue;. the feast was generally enlivened by wit: and merriment; to which large potations. of madeira and rum-puiich contributed not a little; at a party of this fort, T had the indiscretion to go into the water to bathe,, and should have lost my life in the ravenous jaws of a shark, had not my faithful Eugenio jumped into the Sea,, and prevented that voracious animal; from Seizing

One evenii>g, when I was returning from; Supper at a.neighbour’s houSe in .Kingstcm,. the night Serene, the stars and moon shining divinely bright, I heard the Sound of mufic at a distance, my curiofity induced me to follow it; I was led through two. streets into a Small alley, and perceived,, through a window that was left open for? the benefit of the evening breeze, a genteel figure- of a young woman, in a loole calico night-gown, reclined upon a Sopha; she held a guitar in her hand, which she-touched with the most elegant eaSe, and-, which she accompanied as melodioussy as.

Come, my Sriend, come, let’s shiyi the heatj The Sultry heat invades.
To yonder arbour let’s retreat.
And Seek the cooling shades.
The twining jessamine beneath.
And twisted eglantine,
To flying gales their breath bequeath, Almost as Sweet as thine.
Dost See, my dear, this twisted crown, TheSe flow’rs to grace thy head;
’Ere night their fragrance will be gone,
o	^ o	o ^
And all their beauty fade.
So all thy brightest charms shall prove. When with’ring age, draws riigh ;
And what now fills the heart with love.
Be thrown negle<5ted by.
The veins that wander o’er thy neck.
Shall loSe their charming blue;
The blowing rofes in thy cheek.
Their lovely-blushing hue.

On things divine be plac’d your joy;
For now ’tis in your pow’r;
More lasting pleafures your employ,
And Seize the preSent hour.

Ilaving marked the alley in Such s manner, that I could not possibly mistake it another time, i went home to bed ; but, instead oS steeping, I could think but of The lovely objedt that had So enchant! ngly engaged my attention. In the morning, when Eugenio came into-the store from his shed-chamber, I could not help commu'* micating'to him what I had heard and Seen; •and concluded with a firm reSoIution df going immediately, and finding out who she.was. iHe'promifed To accompany me ; and accordingly, as Soon as we had breakfasted, I led him through Several streets, and arlast came to a Cocoa-nut Tree, which
d had made rny-land-mark.--------Here Eu-
-ofenio began to whistle the tune of the
O	‘ o
Children in the wood ; and, when I had got half'Way down the alley, he took me by the-steeve: -Hold, Jerry, faid he, 1 be-dieive it is in my power to make you acquainted with this divinity you have de-
'Scribed.---- If thou wilt, I replied, I will
:give you half my estate;-------- he imme-
diately walked in, and, taking me by the hand, led me into a room where the lady was Sitting : Sister, Said he, give me leave to introduce my friend, Mr. Grant, to you. The gentle reader will eafily conceive, how great was my furprife at finding this shper-
na-
( 47 )
natural creature, to be no other sthan the Sister of my clerk Eugenio; she was dressed in the plainest, but most elegant linnen, and when she roSe to receive me, there appeared Ib much majesty and SvveetneSs in her deportment, that she rivetted very strongly the chains I already wore; her SenSe and good-breeding Surpassed the agree-ableneSs of her perSon ; her stature was rather tall, her hair of a jetty black, her eyes large and piercing, and of a lively grey, and a Set of the most regular ivory teeth graced her Skiall mouth, v/hich was Surrounded by coral lips; no roles and lil-Jies would be equal to her complexion, which was owing to her having lived chiefly upon the blue mountains, where the air is as temperate as at Naples, or Buenos Aires. Lucinda (for that was her name) •was fitting along with her two black maids, putting order to the family linnen; she converled with as much eaSe and propriety, as if she had been bred in a court. My viSit was abridged by the entrance of a rlervant, with the apparatus for dinner ; but, upon my entreating the permishon of repeating my vifit, it was granted with ineffable SweetneSs. I forthwith formed the •Scheme of making Lucinda my Bride ; which, the .first opportunity I had, I communicated
f
( 45 )
municatcd to my mother :	Honey, iaid
she, I hope you won’t be So imprudent, it would very much diSoblige your Sather .; and, in conSequence of that, he possibly might alter his Will to your disadvantage. I have, at last, prevailed upon him to leave you Black Rock ; Numps has been long in possession of High-grumps; but if you should diSoblige him in marrying, be will certainly let the Intail continue, which, but last week, he gave orders to his Lawyer to have docked: Stay, Honey, till he is under ground, and then you may do as you pleale.” The strength of my mother’s argument, for the preSent, .got the better of my inclination. My vifits to Lucinda were, ■however, frequent; and a return of affection from that divine creature Set my heart at eaSe; we both, one afternoon, took our oaths upon the Bible, of inviolable constancy and assertion; and I entered into a private contradf, to marry her within a year after my father’s deceaSe, with a penalty of one thouSand pounds, in cafe I should be guilty of a breach of my promiSe.
My father, one day, when there was a good deal of company at Black Rock, had like to have discovered my attachment to this young lady. It is. she custom in that country, when there is a roasted turkey for
dinner

dinner, and the animal entirely devoured, except the rump, to fix that part upon a fork, calling it the rump oS Some, noted beautv in the Hand; and thoSe who have ^ a regard Sor the lady, or a defire to cat the rump, bid for it in bumpers of wine, or punch, the highest bidder carrying oif the prize; a wag, that happened to be preSent on the day I allude to, put up the turkey’s rump in Lucinda’s name; the very name of that divine creature cauSed a thrilling in my foul; and when I found many candidates for the prize, I was not able to contain my deSire of obtaining it, and I bid tv/elve bumpers the first time. My father looked very grave at this piece of extravagance, which, my mother perceiving, diverted his attention by Some nugatory matter, which she introduced for that purpoSe.
I now got very much into the good gra-, ces of the PreSident of the Istand, who adt-ed in the capacity of Governour, or Corn-mander in chief, during the abSence of the real one; he appointed me his Aid de Camp, by which I ranked in the militia as' Major; I had Iil<£wile the office of Assistant-judge, in the court of Common-pleas, conferred upon me, and, many an afternoon, Snored in conceit upon the bench

One morning, when I was in my first stoze upon the bench, I was waked by a buzzing all over the court; and, enquiring the reafon of it, was told, that my father, mother, lister Judith, and another family, neighbours of theirs, were over-let, by a Sudden Squall, in a boat, going from the main land to Pidgeon-issand ; my grief, at the loSs of two Such tender parents, was inexpressible; Numps almost ranstistrad-ed; and his wife Bet’s affedion to the family, was greatly heightened by her ex-pedation of Black-rock being added to High-grumps; but when the Will was

Saw him from that day. My time was now employed in Settling my affairs, and appointing attornies to take the management of my estate; for I was now reSolved upon a trip to England for improvement, before I married the amiable Lucinda; and, to assure the family of the fincerity of my intentions. Settled an annuity of three hundred pounds a year upon Eugenio, in consideration of his fidelity, and the eminent Services he had rendered me, not only in Saving my life, but in tranSading my buSinefs at Kingston and in London.

Having extraordinary good weather
this year, I made a crop oS three hundred hogsheads of Sugar; all which I embarked on Rudder, and took my paS-Sage in the Same ship. The voyage was a common one; and, upon my arrival, gave my bills of lading to one Mr. CommiS-Sion, who had been recommended to me,
' as a very conScientious man, to whom I determined thenceforward to confign.
Upon our coming near the land at Dover, w^e were met by a fisherman, who, finding me eager to get on shore, had the conscience to aSk ten guineas to land me, with my two Negroe-men, and Malatoe-,wench that I had brought with me; which demand I had the extravagance to comply with. The next impoSition I experienced, was a demand from a man that let carriages to London; he was rather more reasonable than the fisherman, conSidering the work he was to perform; to be brief, I could not agree with him for lest than thirty guineas, for a Landau, to carry me, and my retinue, baggage, &c. to the Crost-keys in Grace-church-street; it was no wonder,
when

( 53 )
when my two Negroe-men, my Mulatoe-Dulcinea, and myfelS, who was likewiSe of a Numidian hue, were getting into the Landau, that the people should gather round us; what do you stare at, you devils. Said I, do you take me for a Hibou, or a Coromantee ? Hark, Said one of them, they are talking their own language; drive on your cochy. Said my russet damSel; yoick! yoick! replied the coachman; and lb we left the attentive throng. We travelled our journey through, though it was the midst of Summer, and the Sun Scorchingly hot, with the landau open, to the infinite diversion and entertainment of the country people, and burgesses of the different towns through which we passed; as I was stepping out of the carriage in the inn yard in Canterbury, I defired the waiter to bring me a glaSs of water; Lord, Said an old apple-woman that was standing by, de- • vouring me with her eyes, as I hope for Salvation, he Speaks English. As I arrived, in London. before it was dark, I immediately Sallied out in quest of lodgings; and. Seeing a bill pasted up at a ♦Pastrycook’s shop at the corner of Lombard-street, without any farther ceremony, agreed for two bed-chambers and a dining-room, at she rate of five guineas a week; from hence

, and dined commonly at Commission’s, lite-
I	rally upon mutton. Mrs. Commiffion was
II	a very gay lady, and uled to Ipend her
evenings at card-assemblies, and other fa-shionable divcrfions. She v:as very intimate at the late Mayorels’s, where, as I
;i;	had	often heard her fay, there refbrted the
:!	best	company in town ; I intimated a cu-
riofity to be introduced. Mrs. Commifi II	fion	had been, in her younger days, a miS-
:|	trefs	to a younger brother oS a member of
I Parliament, distantly related to a very anil tient and noble family, who, a week before
his death, had married her, by way of his cafing his confcience before he departed for the other world; in conlequence of which, she was extremely proud of her family, |; and took every occafion of throwing in
Commishon’s teeth, the meanneSs of his i	mercantile employment.
I	Mrs. Commiffion, according to my de-
I	fire, conduced me, the Monday following,
I	to the late lady MayoreSs’s route, which she
I	kept on that evening. The dwelling of
this quondam queen of the city, was a finall houfe, of about forty pounds a year, in Nicholas-lane, Lombard-street; the passage was So narrow, that Mrs. Commission, with difficulty, could get

through it; which obiter^ as her hoop was^ fix yards in circumference, was no very extraordinary thing.. But her late Ladyship,. SoreSeeing this inconvenience, had, very providently, ordered the door of the parlour to be left open; by which' means, at the Same time that the hoops had more room,, gave her vifitors an opportunity oS admiring her Side-board of plate, which was Set out in the most advantageous manner, to be viewed; I was preSented to her ladyship by Mrs Commission, who was So richly dressed, and ornamented with Such a quantity of jewels and trinkets, and, from the fmallneSs and neatneSs of her abode, that she appeared like a Fairy Queen; we had not been Seated above a minute, but there was a violent rap at , the door, and the Servant announced Lady Sugarloaf, who Seemed overjoyed to See the MayoreSs, as well as Mrs. Commission. The conversation was at first very interesting about the weather, and their colds: “ Pray, my la-dy MayoreSs, ( Said lady Sugarloaf) I “ beg your ladyship’s pardon \ but I pro-“ test I have been So longuSedto call your “ ladyship Lady MayoreSs; but I hope “ your ladyiship will pardon me.

which enSued a loud peal of laughter, in the middle of which we were interrupted by a most tremendous rap, and in came the identical lady DiScount, at whoSe ex* pence their two ladyships, Mayorels and , Sugarloaf, had been entertaining the company. She came Sidling in, and lady Sugar loaf, no Sooner perceived her, but she went up to her, and told her, she was immensely glad to See her ladyship abroad; she had been extremely mortified to learn from lady Mayorels, that her ladyship had been indiSpoSed; and declared, it was So long fince she had Seen her, that the time ' Seemed an age. Lady DiScount returned her many thanks, for the kind part she took in her Sufferings; and Said, she was Sorry she was fo ill last night, she could not let her ladyship in, when she did her the honour of calling at her door.
The raps continued at the door, till three rooms, of which thd first floor of this enchanted castle confisted, were quite full. Tea was Served from a Small cloSet, and after the Ladies were Satiated with Scandal and cakes, card-tables were brought; there were preSent women of all ages, one of eighty, one of Sixty, and one of forty, who
had a Niece that was two or three and twenty.

I	A certain instiiiD led me near the last,
T I	^	^
I , who whilpered me: What do you think of i my Aunt? Should a perSon of her age aim
at conquest? ? She is much to blame, I anSwered, she should leave that to you. A moment after, I happened to stand near ; her aunt; who Said to me. Do you See that ' lady ? She is past Sixty, and yet Ipent more
than an hour at her toilet to-day; it was So much time stung away, I replied; none but women of your beauty should employ their time in that way. I went up to the woman of Sixty, and Sincerely pitied her, when she Said to me : Can any thing be So ridiculous ? the lady that fits at that card-table, is at least eighty years of age, and still she wears pink ribbons; she strives to be young again, and indeed Succeeds very well; for she, is in her Second infancy. Lord, thinks I, do we never perceive our own foibles ? It is happy we can find con-Solation in the follies of our neighbours.
I was in a merry mood ; now. Says I, we have gone upwards enough in conscience ; let me defcend, and begin with the old hag at the top: Madam, Said I, you are So extremely like the lady I have just been talking to, that one would almost take you for Sisters; I do not think there
is much difference in your ages. Why,
Sir,
( 59 )
Sir, I realljr think when one of us dies of old age, the other should quake with fear, I do not think there is two days diff ference in our ages. I immediately went to the lady of Sixty : Ma’me, Said I, I must entreat the favour of you to decide a wager : I have laid, that lady (pointing to the woman of forty) and you are of the fame age; in truth. Said she, I do not think there is fix months difference; this goes on rarely thinks I: I went down another step, and addressing the lady of forty; Pray, Ma’me,
Said I, was not you joking, when you called that young lady your Niece You are as young as she is; nay, she looks battered, which you do not; it is true, she replied, I am her aunt; but her mother was, at least, five and twenty years older than my Self; we were by different mothers; I heard my poor Sister, who is now dead, lay that we were born in the Same year. I thought So, Ma’me, and therefore I might well be Surprised. If I could have got city-routs often, I should have been very^ well pleaSed.
But this was not the cast; tired of a moping life, I was one evening conduced to Mrs-----------’s, under Covent-

discharged my Pastry-copk’s lodgings, rc-mqvcd my Sable attendants to Commiffions, and took up my abode at this place ; here • , I refided, like an Astatic prince, wallowing in pleasures for a month. I was a constant attendant in the green boxes, and uSed frequently to open the Westminster assembly *, at which place, the Singularity of the company, though I was a tropical man, at first a good deal SurpriSed me; the attornies clerks, with Swords aukwardly put on ; the city clerks, with their oaken clubs, and templars made ’Squires, in conjideratione quinque folidovum, C? fex denariorum \ the women in bonnets without ruffles, ssip-shod, dancing minuets, in the taste of ladyxBab ; the adroitnefs and double-capacity ot the

The Reader will not diScrcdit me, when I tell him, that Lyndamira was eaSily per-Suaded to keep my houSe, and Set at the head of my table. The oeconomy of my houshold was diredted by her difcretion ; I took a leaSc for one and twenty years of a houSe of two rooms on a floor in Berkeley-Square, at the annual rent of two hundred and eighty pounds. The receipts for my furniture were all taken in her name, and her arms put upon all my plate, which was denominated her own. 1 hired two waiters from a Bagnio, upon her recommendation, whom, as well as my two negroes, I , clothed in magnificent liveries. I built as handSom a chariot as any in town, and a phaeton, which might have rivalled the car of Phoebus ; and kept four as good Saddle horSes as money could purchaSe. My mornings were now Spent in driving Lyndamira in my Phaeton, backwards and forwards, along Rotten-row in Hyde park, estorted by my two negroes, dressed in my before-, mentioned magnificent liveries, which, be^ ing yellow. Set off, to great advantage, the russet Saces of their wearers.

Our evenings were Ipent at the Play, or Opera, where I did not difdain to fit at Ij	the former in the boixes, nor at the latter
i;	in the pit, by Lyndamira’s fide. This la'll	dyT am Ipeaking of^ was endowed with all
;l	thole alluring arts Ib necessary to perlbns
eminent in the meretricious art; she had
hi
I	tears as much at her command as a Croco-
i|	dile, and was, in every other relpedl, miS-
|l	trels oS her trade, which was	in no	degree
|| •	forprifing, as she had carried	it on	for,	at
least, fifteen years.
I	Lyndamira introduced Several young
||	men oS her acquaintance to me;	one	of
I	whom afterwards confessed to	me,	that	he
!	was So charmed with my creolian holpitali-
I	ty and generofity, that although his first
intention of vifiting my houSe, was to diS-I	honour my bed; yet my behaviour was
j	Such, that he thought he should be guilty
I	of a crime, if he had purSued his original
intention. My paffion, which was once So violent for Lucinda, was now totally extinguished ; and I one day Sat dowiy. and wrote her the following Laconic epistle:
Madam,	Berkeley-fquare., Nov. 6,
^ I "'HE engagement I am under to you,
for many reaSons, which it would be too tedious now to give you, 1 think
highly
( ^3 )
highly improper ; but in any othe-r reSpedl you are at liberty to command.
Madam,
Your devoted Slave,
And humble Servant,
JER. GRANT.
My mercer, as well as all my other tradefirien, had a general order to furnish Lyndamira with whatever she should think proper to take up; and, in fix months aSter my houSe-keeping was established, a bill was brought me in for Sorty-five Sattin and lutestring negligees, she had taken up at the mercers.
No wines were permitted to appear at my table but Tokay, Cape, and Burgundy, even my fervants drank Claret; all which was Served me by a woman of Lyndamira’s recommendation, that lived in Little St. Catharine’s. My dreSs was anSwerable to my equipage and table; and my expences this year amounted to eight thouSand pounds more than the three hundred hogsheads I had imported; which Commishon, after much grumbling, and a promiSe of Suture reformation, was pleaSed to pay.
Another

\
( ^4 )
Another unlucky circumstance, which
m	^
contributed in no Sm.all degree to my unea-SineSs, was a total failure of a crop for the year enSuing; my estate, instead of yielding me any thing, upon a moderate computation, would bring me twelve hundred pistoles in debt; it was likely to make only five hogsheads of Sugar. This melancholy appearance of my affairs, made me come to the wiSe reSolution of reforming my houshold, and returning to Jamaica, to Save money, and Superintend my planta-tation; to which effect, as I wanted horSes for my cattle-mill, and, in order to bring my canes from a remote part of the estate to my wind-mill, I adtually bought fifty ,	stout geldings of a dealer, at forty pounds
a head, and had them removed to a livery-stable in Piccadilly, to be in readineSs to proceed to PortSmouth, at the time the fleet was about to Sail.
As the Bath SeaSon was now coming on, I yielded to Lyndamira’s Solicitation, and my own inclination, of paying a vifit to that place; the neceshty of which she re-prelented to me very strongly.
Now, by way of drawing breath, and to divert the reader, and mylelf, I will give him three Specimens of my genius for imitation, the first shall be in the Shandean

'^ T 'HE Post-chaiSe and four. horSes, with Mr. Grant’s American and European attendants, mounted on battered jades,, richly capariSoned, arrived before his door in Berkely-Square, about twelve o’ clock.
Lyndamira was just waked from her fe-cond steep, and, in foft stumbers, lay ruminating on the golden harvest she was reaping, and ideally anticipated thoSe pleaSures she was hereafter to enjoy at Bath, at the expence of her American cully; she thought, as her reign must be short, she would not Scruple to take largely from the store, which the poor, infatuated Creole imagined was to be as inexhaustible as the mines of Mexico and Peru. The pair having taken their chocoloate, a diet which Grant from his infancy continued the ufc of; band-boxes, hoops, hats, and other paraphernalia, being stowed in the carriage, with difficulty they contrived to Seat them-Selves ; at length they Set off between two and three o’ clock.

After changing horSes at Hounssow and Salt-hill, they arrived at Reading; but, in the intermediate Ipace between the two last mentioned stages, there appeared a magnificent building, about a mile from, the road, and Grant had the curiofity to enquire of a peaSant, that was working in a field hard by, whofe property it was; why. Master, cried Hodge, Scratching his head, “ a fo-“ reigner-man owns it; he comes from Gi-“ mico, his mother was a Blackamoor, “ and the poor man is crazy;” “Why do you think him crazy,continued Grant ?” “That “ houSe shews it, replied the clown; he “ has laid out twenty thoufand pounds in “ building it, when he has only thirty “ pounds a year estate round it.”
Grant, having Satisfied his curiofity, put his hand in his pocket to give the man a shilliiig; but, as it frequently happens, when it glitters without, that nothing Splendid, or Solid, is to be found within. So with regard to him; though his equipage and laced clothes naturally imprelfed the idea of riches on thoSe that Saw him, yet his pockets Scorned to contain a metal that had been produdtive of So many enormities in in the world. His first application was to Lyndamira, who absolutely excuSed her-Self, by telling him, that she had put all
her
S (%)
her money in her trunk, that was gone by the waggon; it cannot be imagined this aS-Severation was true; but this votary of Venus venalis had laid it down as a rule, from which she never departed. Neither to borrow nor lend ; a maxim, in which there is more of avarice than of real oeconomy.
He next aSked the only fervant that attended the chaiSe, (for two w^re gone forwards to order horSes, and a third was still drinking with the hostler at Salt-hill;) the fellow told him, that he had lent his last shilling to John the Butler, to pay for the horSes at the last stage; this mal-a-pert accident cauSed no Small perturbation in the mind of our heroe, who had laid his account, to his having the expences of his journey defrayed by his lervants, which he propoSed to repay when he should arrive at Bath, from a large Sum he intended to draw of Commission from that place.
It was dark long before they reached Reading ; and Ibon after he had alighted, the Postilions came into the room, to demand the refidue of the bill for the horles, the finances of the houshold not having been Sufficient to defray the whole; the Servants were now Summoned one by one; but all to no purpoSe; for the expences to this place had asteady emptied all,their
pockets.	This

This dilemma was extremely perplexing to Grant, Sor which, however, Lyndamira thought shC'had found a Sovereign remedy, by deSiring Grant to order the Landlady to lend him money to pay it; the Landlady was accordingly Sent for, who declared upon her Salvation, that she had paid the last shilling she had in the houSe to her wine-merchant, not two hours before.
'	Grant would have been utterly at a lofs,
had it not been for the fortuitous arrival of his fourth Servant, who, we before hinted, ■had been drinking with the hostler at Salt-hill, while Mr. Grant was engaged in confabulation with the peaSant upon the road.
After Tea was Served, Grant defired the Landlady’s company again, in order to give diredlions for Supper ; for, from what I	the reader knows, it was impossible to
j	think of going farther that night. The
j	landlady might, very properly, be Said to
j	be a woman of confiderable weight; for
j	thirty stones were incapable of forming a
I	counter-balance to her, a circumstance
I	which, in her own opinion, added much
1	confequence to her charadter; her Size,
*	.	with no impropriety, might be likened to
that of Falstaff; upon the question, of what I	could be had for shpper, being put to her;
!	she affirmed, there was nothing but what
i! -	her
■
( 7' )
her houSe afforded, and began a long account oS how many dukes, marquisses, earls, viScounts, bishops, and barons, had honoured her houSe; (arant interrupted this harangue, by deSiring her to let him have a leg oS mutton roasted ; “ Lud, Sir, she “ anSwered, I’m Sorry I can’t ’commodate “ you, I had the prettiest little fide of “ Welsh mutton last week, that ever eyes .	“ beheld ; (Mince a little veal then, conti-
nued Grant *,) “ O Lord, Sir, Said she, if you had been here but to-day at dinner, I had the whitest fillet that ever appear-“ ed upon a table : ” Very near the Same excLiSe was made, with regard to three other things that were aSked for; at last a pair of ducks was mentioned; in which, she Said, she could Suit him to a T, This was an unlucky circumstance for an innocent pair, that had long lived in conjugal harmony and affediion; namely, a duck and drake, that were roosting in a coop at the bottom of the yard, who immediately underwent the ceremony of decapitation.
As Lyndamira’s diSorder required much caution, with regard to her bed, as Soon as Supper was over, she went out to the landlady, and gave her a stridt charge, to lay clean and well-aired sheets upon the bed,
and defired to See them put to the fire;
you
T
( 72 )
you shall, Ma’me, anSwered the landlady; pray, let-me lee them immediately, replied Cyndamira ; for 1 can’t stand upon thefe damp stones; I’ll fetch them in an instant; but never stirred; now the truth of the caSe was, all the sheers in the houSe were dirty, and she did not chooSe to let them be Seen off the bed ; the woman moves like the monument, continued Lyndamira; at which the landlady, being iraScible in her nature, thought the provocation Sufficient to return the charge; Marry come up, Said she, though I’m but an inn-keeper’s wife, I think mySelf better than Ibme Solks, I was honestly married, thank God, and -have not the fin of carnal fruition to an-<Swer for. What^dces the creature mutter ? Said Lyndamira, with all the coolneSs imaginable; Creature your Self, replied the landlady, poor, rotten jade, that can’t bear to stand upon a stone; though you wear Silks and- lace, I much question whether you
have a Smock to your a---------. At this last
Salutation, Lyndamira’s phlegmatic cho-ler being railed, she flung out of the kitchen, and repaired immediately to Grant, and declared she would leave the houfe that
« ,
instant; to which Grant, under any other
j	circumstances, would readily have .conSent-

could not leave the houle, without money to pay the bill, and hire horSesto go on:; and Lyndamira Soon aSter refiedling, that iS she continued her dudgeon, the reckoning must be deducted Srom her own stock, for this plain reaSon, becaule neither Grant, nor his lervants, had a farthing remaining, reSolved to put up with the landlady’s opprobrious language; when the pair rung the bell, that they might repair to the place devoted to steep and love; the landlady entered with the bill, and defired to know, whether the post-horSes were to she added: This was the height of malice; for she must have been Senfiblc, that Grant was unable to dilcharge it without a fresh Supply, which there was no possibility of his hav-' ing had, between the time he had first ap-plied'to her, and the time she brought the bill; he told her, that he had forgot his •pocket-book when he left London, and accordingly diSpatched one of his tartarean attendants that instant, though it was near eleven o* clock, with a letter to CommiS-Sion, entreating the favour of him to Send him a fifty-pound bank-note by the bearer.
Lyndamira feemed not at all dilpleafed at the neceshty they were reduced to, of staying the greatest part of the following day where they were; and told Grant, she

The rofy-fingered GoddeSs had now opened the folding portals of the east; now I	the feathered choiristers trilled tremuloussy
I	through the grove the most melodious and
enchanting lays; the sturdy plough-boy had drove his jocund team a field; in short, the fun shone So bright into Grant and Lyndamira’s bed-chamber, that they roSe three hours earlier than their time, and Set out to view the Spot, where Lyndamira had first made her appearance in the world; when they approached the houSe, they met a peaSant, whom Grant thought it was necessary to question, touching the Situation and preSent circumstances of Lyndamira’is family he told him, that the elopement of the eldest daughter had broken the old man’s heart, who doated upon her; that the Second Sister still lived with her mother, not without having incurred a ssur upon her charadler; but upon what foundation,

Lyndamira’s curiofity, however., led her to view the local ; and she Sound •every thing in flatu quo^ although she ■had left it Seven years; as our pair was walking Serioussy back, and being arrived ,-at a gate, which led into a grove. Grant caught a view of a pair of lovers, just as ithey were finking out of fight. The adlive iparty Seemed, by the colour of his dreSs, to be of the military fort.; and his Dide> had the appearance, as well as he could judge from So great a distance, of a country damSel. Grant being a thorough bred . fportSman himfelf, did not choofe to crois the Scent of another, or to be more explicit, to fpoil Sport; but Lyndamira expressed a wonderful curiofity to know the parties, and declared she would remain at the gate till the conssidt was ended ; in about three quarters of an hour they deScried the pair; when the amorous couple appeared to view. Grant was not a little furpriSed to find, that Lyndamira recognized the female to be her own lister; while the fe-males were converfing about family-matters, the Son of Mars drew near Grant; and, after staring at him a conssderablc

time, very abruptly came up, and ashed, 11	whether he was a native oS Jamaica ? As
Grant was alarmed at the question, he re-I	treated a pace or two, and defired to know
his reaSon Sor putting the question; I mean no harm, cried the officer ; I only thought I recolledted in your features my old friend Jerry Grant; Grant immediately went up to him, and, to His infinite pleaSure, found this amorous warrior to be no other than his old School-fellow Stephens, of whom mention is made in the former part of theft I	Peregrinations.
o
Stephens told him, he bore a Com mission in an old regiment, that was quartered at .	' Reading and Marlborough, which had
f ^ been procured him through the influence
of a friend of his ; that when he left Con-
I*
cord’s, he went to the UniverSity of Cambridge; from whence he wasignominioufly j	expelled, for keeping a woman of the
town in his rooms ; and his relations in MontSerrat had died inSolvent, and left him destitute. Whilst Grant and Stephens were communicating to one another the occurrences of their lives fince parting, Lrynda-inira and her Sister came up, and were astonished, in their turns, to find that Grant and the other Swain converftd Ib freely with one another.
Lynda-
( 77 )
Lyndamira*s Sister (whole name was Patty) was low of stature, fresh-coloured, and, upon, the whole, might be faid to be any man’s meat; she informed the company, that her father was So affedfed, by Lynda-mira’s elopement,, that he never after held up his head,, but Secretly pined, and, in two monshs, died of a broken-heart; she Said, that she herlelf had reSolved to follow i. a virtuous courSe of life, and should not
have retired into the grdve this morning with Captain Stephens, if she had not looked upon herfelf as married to him.:
Nec jam furtivum Dido meditatur amerem, Conjugium vocat: hoc jfrcetexit nomine culpam.
By this delufion shq cheated herfelf of her own virtue;. not but what Stephens had given her fome matrimonial hints, which indeed is almost always done, when a girl is prevailed upon to divest herSelf of that precious jewel, which, once gone, can never be recovered.

Though Stephens was quartered in that neighbourhood, he was eaSily perSuaded, as well as Patty, to accompany Grant and Lyndamira to Bath ; Stephens having a tolerable Supply of cash, to pay the men under his command, as well as for the pur-

When we came to the houle, every thing had the appearance of being adjusted for that night; but Origan, perceiving a light in the kitchen, tapped at the window, and the door was opened to us; the hostler, who was at the Same time tapster, was regaling two of his rural friends, at the expence of his master, upon strong beer and rack-punch ; upon our deSire of being admitted into the apartments of Some of their female boarders ; the fellow told us, he did not understand what we meant, by disturbing a regular family at that time of the night; and defired, that we would go ellewhere j O, by Jefus (cried Origan) let us be after going up stairs; the hostler, finding that we were about to go up stairs, and that his fervid entreaties availed him nothing, endeavoured to oppofe us by force; which he no Sooner attempted, than the Hyber-nean gave the word to engage: and po-, ker, tongs, shovel, plates, gridirons, and other ornaments of the chimney-place, flew

But mistakes of that Sort were very frequent with him, even in his warrants; he once lent a man to Bridewell for frying of Bacon (firing a Beacon;) but still his obstinacy was So great, that he perSisted to a£t in the commission, contrary to the advice and opinion of all his neighbours that wished him well: — “ Gentlemen, (for “ you certainly are gentlemen, and bear “ the King’s commishon, as well as I do) I dare Say, you are Sorry for what you have

peer of Ireland, whoSe title was Sparkle j he came down to Bath with his dowager, who was then at the point of death; this nobleman had many good qualities, blended with Ibme of the greatest faults; he had parts ; was a great fenSualist ; and was remarkable for his passion for driving stage and hackney coaches, in which art he was generally esteemed the greatest proficient of the age; as his good qualities had a great affinity to thoSe of Horatio, that pof-fibly may be the reaSon for which they were inseparable.
I was now known by no other name than that of Prince Grant; and as my title was elevated, reSolved to keep none company, but thofe of a Superior Sort; in short, I became, what is not improperly called, a quality-binder, and conceived a particular antipathy to a plain coat, or a bob-wig ^ and worshipped any creature, however insignificant, graced by chance with a title ; my reSpeft and attention being proportioned to the degree of nobility. As I was-frequently at Lord Sparkle’s elbow, I, by that means, contraDed an intimacy with Horatio, and took a lingular delight in the conversation of this quondam heroe of the theatre; he diverted us infinitely by curious anecdotes relating to the great, among

wBfOm, he had a good deal lived; and, I eonfeSs, I always thought him more engaging in a chit-chat, than over a bottle.
One evening, in a party of the former Sort, Horatio expressed himlelf in the following words:	One night, after my
“ bufineSs upon the stage was over, as I was; “ fitting in the Bedford Coffee-houSe, drink-“ ing my mug of beer, and eating my oysters, his Grace of Wharton, with twO' or three of his madcap companions came in; as Soon as he Saw me, he cried, what^ “ are you alive ? I thought long before “ this, you had been hanged, or dead of the X; ” the reader will eafily be able to Substi tute the word intended by the crols,, or algebraical fign of multiplication 5, which I have the rather chofen, as I am defcended of Scottish ancestors, it being a St. Andrew’s Crofs, and, for that rea-Ibn more properly belonging,, or appertaining to my name, than a St. George’s crofs, or a croSslet, or an union crols 5 and I think anfwers the purpoSe full as well as a Shandean star, or, peradventure,. better; as what is meant, in this place, is certainly a crols, — a crofs. in love; the reply my friend made to the duke’s observation, has more wit in it than most things that ever were Said; which every

that thing called wit, is oSten miStaken.
Locke tells us, it is a quick assemblage of ideas, and putting thofe together with quickneSs and variety, wherein can be Sound any reSemblance or congruity, thereby to make up pleaSant pidiures in the fancy. Dryden informs us, it is a propriety of 'thoughts and words, or,, in other terms, thoughts and words elegantly adapted to the Subje<51:. Pope fays, it is a quick conception, and an eaSy delivery.. Boileau Says^ it conSists in preSenting to the reader true thoughts and just expressions.
The mind of man is naturally full of an infinite number of confufed ideas of what is just, which it often perceives but by halves; and nothing is more agreeable to it, than when Some of thofe ideas are presented to it very clearly and distindUy, What is a new, brilliant, and extraordinary thought ^ It is not, as ignorant people think, a thought which nobody has ever had ; it is, on the contrary,, a thought which any one may hit upon, and which Some one has been So lucky as to be the first perSon that uttered it; a hon mot is a bon. mot only, be-cauSe it repreSents a thing, which every one thinks, and expresses it in astively, delicate,

Let us conSider, for instance, that famous orply of Lewis XII. to Some of li'-s mindtcis, who adviSed him to punish Several -perSons, who, under the preceding reign, and whilst he was only Duke of Orleans, had endeavoured to injure him^ A king of France (fie anSwer-ed) should not revenge the duke of Orleans’s injuries.” What is the reaSon of this expression immediately striking us ? is it not eaSy to See *, it is becauSe it prefents to us a truth, which a’l the world must allow, and that it expresses better than the most elaborate. dissertation of morality, that a great prince,'being placed upon the throne, ought not to a£l from private motives, nor to have other views, than the glory and general welfare of his dominion’s.
Now, whatever be wit, 'whether it is what Locke defines, or what Dryden or Pope Says, or what DeSpreaux deScribes, let it be which of them you will, I still maintain, that my friend’s repartee had more wit in it, than most things that have been Saidu The duke told him before this, “ he ima-“ gined he was cither hanged, or dead of “ the X ; ” “ Then, my lord duke, (answered my friend) “ I must have embraced “ your Grace’s principles, or your Grace’s wh—res.”

As neither Jacobs nor Stephens’s finances would permit them to keep the best company in town *, to my shame I must com feSs, although I was indebted to the Sormer for what he had lent me at Reading, I frequently uSed to affedl not to See them, when they came into the long-rooms, which they very properly reSented by negledling me in their turns.
The Summer now advancing apace, I hired a magnificent Seat in Gloucestershire, called Ingerford-park, for which I was to pay eight hundred guineas ; it had a Ipa-cious park belonging to it, and was very elegantly furnished; all my fervants were ordered down from London, and I rernov-ed Lyndamira thither, who had invited her fister to paSs the Summer with her. I gave Sparkle an invitation to Spend a month, as well as Horatio; the former exculed him-felf, for the preSent, upon account of his dowager’s death, whoSc corps he was obliged to attend to the family-vault near London ; but promiled, as Soon as that was done, to return to me in Gloucestershire; and Said, he had a Scheme to propofe, which would divert us for a considerable time; His lordship, according to his word, .attended his mother to the grave; and, that lie might do the honours more corn-

pleatly, perSonally drove up the hearSc that conveyed her body; and, at the Same time ^ that he dilcharged a duty that was incumbent upon him, gratified his favourite paS-fion for driving; Horatio agreed to honour me with his company; but upon condition, that I should Supply him twice a week with John Dorees; which I promifed, and Sent orders to Plymouth to have a dozen diSpatched to me twice a week, during the SeaSon, by expreSs.
One evening, after Lyndamira and Patty had retired, I pressed Horatio to gratify a defire I had Ions; entertained, to know the particulars of his life; he told me, there was nothing very interesting in it ; but that. Such as it was, as I deSired it, he would willingly recite it; alter he had taken a bumper of claret, he began, as follows:
“ I am the Ion of a Grocer, in a Small town in Warwickshire; my father was reputed a man of tolerable Substance, and Sent me, by the time that I was Seven years old, to the free-School in Warwick ; where I was grounded in Latin, and acquired a ,Smattering in the Greek tongue, and particularly excelled in declamation. I was early an admirer of the theatre, and Shake-Ipear was my favourite author, from the time I first could read him. My father,
con-
( 9^ )
contrary to the expedlations oS his friends and neighbours, died very much in debt, and his children, which were eight in number, leSt entirely destitute. When this event happened, I was of the age of fifteen, and though i had the offer oi having the shop continued to me; yet, as my genius-lay in declamation, I relblved to Sollow it. I therefore went over to Coventry, where 1 enlisted in a troop of strolling players, that were exhibiting in that city. I was put to the lowest characters, which So mortified my ambition, that, as Soon as we 'came within a Small distance of London, I took my leave of my fellow-comedians, and ■presented mySelf to one of the managers of the King’s theatres ; I was by him referred to the principal aflor, who, after many exceptions to the clumfineSs of my perSon, diired me for the SeaSon as a third rate ; for we have rates behind the Scenes, as well as they have in the navy.
“ The first five years I could not get higher than the lieutenant of the Tower in Richard the third, or Rofincraus in Hamlet. But, as I paid great court to Booth, whole manner I imitated, and made the model I went upon, by steps I at last roSe to the first claSs. When I arrived in this station, I became intimate with one of the first adtresses,
with

t 97 )
with whom I aSterwards long cohabited, ■and shall ever think of her with reverence and esteem ; when she died she left me a thousand pounds ; the corner-stone upon which I have railed the comfortable pittance I am master of. Before this event, I had no idea of the value of money, or the difficulty of getting it ; but now finding, that money makes money, I laid it down as a rule thenceforwards, to Save a third part of my income; which I ever aSter adhered to, during my continuance in the Service of the public.
“ As I was now known to be a man of property, many of the adtresses of the first claSs, laid all the Snares they could, to draw me into matrimony; a trap which, I hope, to have discretion enough always to avoid ; for I look upon that state as a civil death, and people, that have the misfortune to be in it, as only the ghosts of men; the famous
Mrs W ------ n, in particular, levelled her
battery at me; but she was a bad canoneer, and not a shot took place. One evening, when I was playing with a Spaniel, which formerly belonged to my defundt benefadt-reSs, the lady I am Speaking of, came up to me : “lam glad. Sir, (Said she), you “ love Something in the world.’* “ Yes * ^ Madam, I anSwered her, I love a dog,
¥	«but
r
( 9^ )
but I hate a bitch.” This repartee So ef-fe<5Iually cured the lady bS her intentions upon my celibacy, that she Seldom ever after troubled me with her coqueteries.
“ One night, when I perSonated the cha-radter oS Caled, in the Siege of DamaScus; and, at the end of the third adt, when I came off the stage, having repeated that •celebrated description oS paradiSe-:

“ I generally go once in a Summer to eat John Doree; but the last time I was there,
I thought I should have died; for I was three whole days without fish, my mare was lame, my food was lean bacon, ewe mutton, cow beef, and brown veal. My heart is SuSccptible of friendship,,and I can make whom I pleafemy friend.
The nobility in general reSpe<5t me; except that little walpish, witty earl, who, meeting me one morning at Seven o’clock, ,as I was coming from the tavern, ashed me, from whence I came ? 1 told him from the three-tuns; no, Horatio, he anSwered, yyou come only from two-tuns, for you have brought one away with you.”
When my friend had ended his recital,. I gave him many thanks for his candour and franknest, in diScloSing his thoughts with the freedom he had done.
The day following Sparkle arrived from London, and diverted us very much, with a brother lord of his, having purchased punch upon the road of a Puppet-.shew-man, and afterwards kicking him down stairs, becaufe Punch could not ipeak.	Sparkle
( I-OI )
Sparkle now told me, that the Ichemis: he-had to propoSe, which would divert u&_ for a confiderable time during, the Summer, was the adting a play; he no Sooner mentioned it, than the thought was applauded by the whole company, as a very bright one, and H®ratio recommended the tragedy of Julius CaeSar; as we wanted a> Sufficient number of adtors, I Sent an ex-preSs over to Bath, to Stephens and Jacobs, with So pressing an invitation, that, notwithstanding the coolneSs I had So ridiculously been the occaston of, they buried their animoSity in oblivion; and conSented to be of the party.- Sparkle procured me . the other members of the drama; Horatio, however, could not be prevailed upon to be,, of the number ; alledging, that he would willingly adt Brutus, to oblige Mr, Grant, but would whistle it for no man living ;• he promhed to be a prompter, and give out the parts ; accordingly he allotted me: Brutus; Sparkle, Mark Anthony; Stephens, Cassius, which Suited extremely well, as Stephens was of a consumptive habit of body, and gave a lively idea of the Spare and hungry Cassius; Jacobs had .Cteiar; i Lyndamira, Portia ; and Patty, Calphurnia.

We were now employed in getting our parts, rehearfing, and directing the workmen to fix up Scenes and benches in the great hall.

Said he, if Mr. “ Grant v/ill but write to the manager of “ the other houSe, though he is unknown to “ him, he will obtain a promife of them “ immediately.

According to Horatio’s- hint, a letter was forthwith dilpatched to the-manager of the other houSe ; who immediately granted our request without fee or reward. —The day after our theatrical exhibition was end-

cd, the following paragraph, written by Horatio, was inSerted in the Gloucester'^ journal:
“ On Monday the i8th, Friday the 22d, “ and Monday the 25th past, was adted at “ Ingerford-park, the Seat of Jeremiah Grant, ESq; the tragedy of Julius C^Sar, as written by ShakeSpear. The hall at “ Ingerford, which is a cube of thirty feet, “ was, upon the occafion, converted into a “ theatre, with Scenes in front, and at the fides; the Seats, which were all in front “ of the stage, held completely one hundred “ Ipedlators, and were filled each night “ with perfons of fashion, as well of the “ neighbouring counties, as our own, ta “ whom Mr. Grant Sent cards of invitation “ among others were the duke and ducheSs

“ Mr. Edward--------, and the miSs---, the

“ the honourable Mr. and Mrs. - -	&c.
“ &c. There was a fine band of mufic, “ in which the principal parts were per-“ formed by the celebrated Mr. Burton,
Mr.
( 105 )
Mr. Gordon, and Seignor Franchila, “ Srom l.ondon. The play was opened “ with a prologue, written upon the occa-“ fion, which was Ipoken, with great pro-“ priety, by Mr. Grant; the charadters oS “ the play were represented by gentlemen' “ and ladies, whoSe rank in life made an' “ eaSy elegance of deportment habitual tOf “ them.
“ The calm, steady dignity of Brutus-“ was nobly Sustained by Mr. Grant, and “ excellently contrasted with the rash, ve^ “ hement impetuofity of Cassius, by Capt.. “ Stephens, eSpecially imthe Scene of their “ quarrel, in the fourth adl. The part of “ Mark Anthony was performed by the “ earl of Sparkle, who looked, as well as “ adled, the charadtcr; his manner was “remarkably natural and eaSy, and his gesture Such and Such only, as the Senti-“ ments he expressed upon the occafion-“ would naturally produce. The part of Ctcfar was performed by Mr. Jacobs,. “ and with great propriety, particularly im “ the fcene of the Ghost, whom his voice-“ and manner made very shining. Cafka “ was done by Mr. Bun, who entered into “ the charadter with So much art, that it “ had the strongest appearance of nature ; “ the very temper of the man, as Shake-

“ Spear has drawn it, was expressetLas well “ in the tone and manner oS utterance, as “ in thev/ords themSelves.
“ Calphurnia was performed by Mrs. “ Martha Clltrap, whole figure was equal “ to whatever the fancy might conceive of “ the wife of CaeSar ; her voice and man-“ ner v:ere Soft and plaintive, perSedlly Suit-“ ed to'the tender expostulation, for which “ the poet has principally introduced the “ charadler; and which, short as it is, did “ not leSs contribute to interest the audience ,	“ for Caefar, than the innate dignity of
“ his own charadter. The part of Portia, “ the wife of Brutus, was performed' by Mrs. Lyndamira Ciiltrap, to whom we “ dare not do justice, lest we should incur “ the imputation of flattery, and offend that delicacy which is So difficult to pleale “ by commendation; let it Suffice to Say, “ that she never appeared without giving “ fresh pleaSure to the audience, whole fixt “ attention, while she was preSent, gave “ the most indubitable token of thorough “ approbation. The rest of the charadlers, “ though of leSs moment, were Sustained “ with equal propriety. So as to render the “ whole representation uniform, as well as y agreeable and affeding.”

Lyndamira’s dilbrder gaining upon her every day ; and qualms oS conScience, as she pretended, at her past and preSent courSe of life, becoming troubleSome; she frequently expressed a deSire to retire, for the remainder of her days, into a Convent; and one day pressed me fo much, that my confent was at last wrung from me. The only thing now to be fettled v/as a proper allowance ; and as she Seemed determined to remain in a Convent for life, she deSired it might be an annuity for the term of her own life. I therefore Settled three hundred pounds a year upon her, payable half-yearly from my estate in Jamaica. Two days after the deed was executed, she shewed me a letter from her confessor, father Fitz-clabber, a Romish priest in London, by which it appeared, that he had obtained leave of the abbeSs of a Nunnery in BruS-lels, to have her admitted, as Soon as she choSe to repair to that place ; which the father deSired might be Speedily, as Several people had put in for the vacant cell, which he had obtained by particular favour ; and ended his letter by an offer of
his
I
( 109 )
his Services to attend her to Brussels. A recital of our parting would affect the most flinty heart; she wept, and hung about my neck, as I formerly had done round that of my mother, when we first Separated at Black-rock in Jamaica. I was So touched with Lyndamira’s Sufferings, that, as a farther token of my regard, i added fifty pounds a year to her annuity.
At length the fatal time arrived, and Lyndamira and Patty Set out for London,, attended by one of my Servants.
My friend Sparkle had long, been entreating me to accompany him in a tour to Italy, he intended shortly to make ; and now finding the chief obstacle removed, by Lyndamira^s taking the veil, redoubled his efforts, in order to prevail upon me. He faid he had, with fome difficulty, got a passport from the French court to past through Phance, which is the shortest and most agreeable way of going into Italy, and would make the tour in as short a fpace of time as I should think proper; and added, the shorter it was, the more convenient it would be for him, as he was un-der an abfolute necessity of returning by the general Eledlion, which, it was imagined, would be in March or April at farthest. He fai.d, he would recommend me a SwiSs-

Horatio tooke his leave with the utmost, regret, as I had lately hired a French cook, that was generally allowed, by the noblemen and gentlemen of the neighbourhood, to exceed any that had exhibited be-., fore in England, either in Lincoln’s-inn-fiekis, or oppoSite to the Admiralty coffee-houSe in Charing-croSs. My draught of. Burgundy was likewise incomparable, another loadstone by which our modern Fab staff was very powerrully attached.

Having agreed to accompany his
lordship during his tour through Italy, and to return with him before the next general Eledlion, at which he was, in all probability, to have a very expenfive contested eledion ; and having promiSed to take into my pay the SwiSs-governour, or travelling tutor, he had recommended to me; I Set out from my Seat in Gloucestershire for London, and went to his lordship’s houSe in GroSvenor’s-Square; from whence that evening we diSpatched letters to Henri., the taylor, at Paris, with our meaSures, by expreSs, with a general order to make, with all Speed, ten of the richest Suits, for each of us, that his art was master of.
My governoLir waited upon me an hour after 1 arrived, and told me, that he had travelled with, ten English noblemen, from whom he had the strongest testimonials, had made the complete tour of Europe five times, and gave me his terms in writing; which' were, two hundred a year whilst we were travelling, and an annuity of an hundred
( II2 )
dred pounds to be Settled upon him as Soon as we returned. I Signed the articles without delay, and the next morning we Set out for Dover, his lordship and mySelt in one chaiSe, and the two governors in another.
Sparkle’s governor was a Scotch phy-fician, who had rendered many and Singular lervices in his profession to his pupil. We went at the rate of an hundred and fifty miles a day to Paris, where we stayed only two days ; and, as Soon as our clothes were tried on, and packed up, we travelled on to Lyons, which place we reached in two days. Here, having a mind to reconnoitre my governor a little, I got into the chaiSe with him ; his name was Durlach, he was a native of the Canton of Bern, and a minister of the holy Evangelist; he had Seen a great deal of the world, and was particularly Skilled in his office, as in-tendant des plaijirs.
We halted for an hour upon Mount Ce-nis, where, after hearty draughts of Mont-melian wine, to expel the cold, the ground being covered with Snow, which it gene-,rally is, at the time of the year we were there, it being the end of November, we reelled into our chaiSes. The day following arrived at Turin, and were preSented to the King of Sardinia, and the next even-
\
( )
ing took the route of Florence, where we-delivered our letters of recommendation ta dodtor Cocchi, who fold us Some antiques; we went on to Rome, still at the rate of tn hundred arid fifty English miles a day,, where we- arrived after it was. dark ; and,, ' as we propoSed making our stay there only on our return from Naples,, went to Sec-St* Peter’s church with a candle and lan-thorn.
This evening Sparkle wrt>:e to England by the post,, for a hogshead of beer,. and an oaken stick, to be Sent to Rome by the first ship, which he hoped would arrive bjr the time he returned from Naples.
The next morning we Set out, before it was light, for Naples, where it was oue fixed resolution to rest ourSelves for a con-fiderable time ; the evening we arrived^-waited upon the. English envoy, next day were preSented at court; and here, let me not bury in oblivion the Services of my faithful minister of the holy Evangelist; it was, by his friendly interpofition, I had the honour of paying a ducheSs a thou Sand chequins, for being admitted chichishaio> to her daughter. Had it depended entirely upon mySelf, here 1 would have stopt-our invention of the perpetual motion; but his lordship, whoSe mind was not quite
So-
C II4 )'
fb’Senfible of the gentle pashon as miner was, hourly reminded me of the general • Eledlion he was to be preSent at.
After we had been at Naples ten days,, we returned to Rome; where we had a-Seven days leDure of Russel upon virtUy and I bought an original madona of Guido’s- for t-welve hundred chequins.
The very evening our ledlure was finish--ed, we posted to Venice; shut ourSelyes up a day and night with tv:o opera girls; from thence posted, as fast as post-horSes-could go, to Milan ; but stopt an hour at Fadoua, to hear a Solo by Tartini; we crossed Mount Bernard, went to Bafil and Strashourg, went down the Rhine to the Hague, to Helovet-fiuice, and So home v without staying, more than ashngle night at any place-after we left Venice ; having ne-ver.exchanged a'Syllable with any stranger, except Henri the taylor, the king of Sardinia, the king of Naples, the young du-cheSs I was chichishaio to, and the concu--bines-at Venice.
As to discharging billsj and tranSadiing other necessary matters upon the road, the Helvetic parSon, and Scotch dodlor, were very well paid for doing them. My whole knowledge of Italian conSisted of three words,, viz. andate., pin., prejio; and of

SOON after'we arrived in London, T went down to New-market with Sparkle, who Sent two Italian greyhounds, which: he had bought at Venice, forwards in a.^ post-chaife and four ; and theSe gentlemen,. like the rest of their countrymen, grew Ib extremely dainty, as Ibon as they trod upon English ground, that they could eat nothing but Vermicelli Soup and'Macaroni. Here we staid three days, to the infinite diverfion and entertainment of the gentlemen of the-turf ; for we daily exhibited Henrfs performances, being curled and powdered in* the true Parifian taste.
The conversation, in all genteel company, now turned, upon the eledtions, which^

the Parliament shou G ue v V ]lS at

a SeaSon of the year when there was no

shooting or hunting in the country,.
One morning, as I was peruSing a paper at the coffee-houSe at New-market, f observed an advertisement from a certain. Borough in the West of England, inviting, any gentleman of public Spirit, and a friend to liberty, to offer himlelf as a Candidate to reprelent it: As I had formed a-, distant notion of getting into Parliament,, this article struck me, and I conSulted Sparkle as foon as I met him; “ Why,, (Said he. Prince) ‘‘ I think you are right,v I would have you try; every man of “ fashion ought to get into Parliament; “ beSides, you have talents, and may make “ it worth your while; as to the expence,, you must not mind it of fix-pence, that’s “ neither here nor. there; when a man Sets his mind upon a thing, it comes o£ courSe. Go up with me to-morrow “ morning, and I will recommend two of the finest eledlioneerins: fellows in Eii-rope to you : If you carry your ele<5tion, “ /wi//qualify you.”
Imen-,
( iry )
1 mentioned tke Scheme to Several other tioblemen, that Supped with me at the Ordinary at New-market that evening ; who all .assured me, that it was a very SeaSible one ; and adviSed me, hv all means, to Set out with the earl oS Sparkle next morning.
I went down to the field oS adlion, armed with five thouSand pounds in bank-notes, and accompanied by the two electioneering gentlemen, recommended to me by Sparkle, whom he had retained for his own purpofe; but his election being Settled by compromile, he had no farther occafion for them. One was master of a coffee-houfe, remarkable for Singing drinking-fongs in the true Bacchanalian style; the other was a celebrated mimic, who has long diverted the town. After I had declared my purpoSe of coming down, to the returning officer of the Corporation, and the principal Burgesses, I cauSed the largest tun, that could be got, to be filled with strong beer, and placed in the most conSpi-cuous part oS the Market-place, and invited all degrees of men to partake of it; when I thought the concourSe of people -confiderable enough, I mounted the vaSe a-stride, like Bacchus on a tun, and taking off my wig, which discovered pieces of black sticking plaister, that were put on for
the
( ii8 )
'.the occaSion, I harangued the mob -for an -hour, upon liberty, property, and independency. I told them, I had received the wounds, they Saw upon my head, in fighting in my country’SiCauSe, and Sor the privileges of‘that Borough in particular. At -the end of my Speech, they .gave me three .cheers, and Swore, ;to a man, they would stand by me till they had lost the last drop of their blood.
My emissaries brought over a great m.a-,ny wavering votes; and my antagonist began to fear the issue of the eledtibn. He was an eminent clothier in the city, and depended So much iUpon his interest, amongst the manufaclurers in the Borough, that he had negledted all the other voters, who, though inSerior in number, yet made up a very considerable part of the body of burgesses.
As my harangue upon the tun had worked So Surprising an effedt, the Clothier made an attempt of the Same Sort ; but his talents, for public declamation, falling 'short of mine, the huzza’s he received, were by no means adequate to his wishes. .His perSon was very diminutive, shis dreSs fingular, his voice low and drawling; So ■that it was no difficult matter for my friend vthe Mimic, .1 had -brought dowri, to take
him

f
( J'lp )
shim off; which he did So inimitably in evc-■ry particular, that the citizen heartily re-p>ented his public harangue ; the manuSac-turers began to come over to me ; and I was now determined to Spare no expence;; I had twenty houSes open to both parties, ^equally, and my agents gave fifty pounds a vote.
At length the day of eleclion being arrived ; when the votes came to be Summed up, notwithstanding my expence and contrivances, my antagonist was declared duly eleDed, by a majority of eleven votes.
No one can judge of the dejeflion of a disappointed candidate, but the man, who has been adlually in that Situation; my shank-notes were all diSperSed ; and I was obliged to borrow money of the coffee-houSe-man, and mimic, to pay my way up to London. I had nothing to conSole me, shut the having, without interest or.connection, by mere dint of money and contrivance, gone within a few votes of carrying a Borough, against a rich citizen, that had long represented it, backed with the power ianaTScippottiof the Court.
•Sparkle, and the rest of my acquaintance, -adviSed me by all .means to petition; -and offered to uSe their interest to get me admitted a member of Arthurs club ;
wliicte
( 120 )
’Which, they affured me, v/ould be a certain method oS procuring many voices in deciding my petition ; and told me of lord LMNOPQ^s having Succeeded totally by that means.
When I was at breakfast one morning, a Servant came up, and told me there was .a perSon below, who was extremely eager to See me; I defired he might be shewed fup, when there entered the Stable-keeper in Piccadilly, at whoSe stables I bought thefor-'ty horSes fourteen ''months before, to stock my plantation, when I had laid the wife fcheme, of returning to Jamaica. He told me, that, having never heard of me for more than a year, he had Sold the horles, to reimbiirSe the charges he had been at, in keeping them; but that they did not fetch more than twelve pounds a piece, for which reaSon 1 was confiderably in his debt. I was a good deal chagrined at this negled and forgetfulneSs of my own ; but the debt was certainly a just one, and I was obliged to allow it; which, however, it was not in my power to diScharge immediately ; I therefore gave him a bond for the money, payable in fix weeks ; the man made many remonstrances about the length
of the time, his having long been out of
his
*
( }
his money, his poverty, and large family; to all which I readily agreed; but told him, I could not not possibly raiSe money Iboner.
I was now admitted to play at Whist at a certain great man’s houSe in Argyle-Buildings, in the evening, Sor fix-pence a ‘ game; and one of the members of that Society introduced me to a certain diredtor of eledlions, who bad countenanced my antagonist. My principal voter, who en joyed a place under the government, was in danger of being turned out, becauSe he had zealoussy assisted me; well knowing the timidity of this perSonage in matters of this Sort, I reSolved to try, whether a, few words, in favour of my friend, would be of any Service in continuing him in his employment. When he Saw the gentleman appear, with a stranger following him, he got up from his chair, and came to meet us. Scratching his cheek as he w^alked forwards ; as Soon as the gentleman told him my name, he catched me by the hand, and Said: “ My dear Mr. Grant, I hope your “ family is well; now this is very kind, I “ thank you athouSand, thouSand times for “ this kind favour.”
I placed mystlf in the circle next to a corpulent man in black; the peribnage in

“ My dear Sir, Said he, I have not Sorgot “ you; what you deSire, you may depend “ upon being done.” What I defire, answered my neighbour; I never yet ashed a favour of you, nor ever will. Oh, my dear Sir, Said he, I mistake, aiiS Sidled off. I staid there till the parSons were gone, and perceiving that he had an inclination to give me the Slip, placed mySelf diredlly before the door; and told him, that I had a few words to Say in behalf cf a friend of mine. This is an ugly bufineSs, Mr. Grant, Said be, I am now in a great hurry ; have you any commands at St. James’s} Sir, I an-, ' fwered, if my friend lofes his place, it will be fb great a violation of the freedom of eledlion, that I will make the town ring of it. This is an ugly bufineSs, Mr. Grant, laid he, I must be gone ; have you any commands at St. James’s ? My vifit was produdlive of the effedt defired; for my man was never disturbed in his employment.
The English phrale, for a man’s Spending his estate is, e. g. Mr. Grant has run out his fortune; and the realbn of it is, FewuSe the English are a people that delight

light in dissipation, and running from place to place. The French term for the lame thing is, e. g. Monfieur Grant a mange tout fon bien., (has eat his fortune;) now, as the French are remarkable for eating to exceSs, they naturally apply their favourite term to the a6t of a man’s ruining him-ielf; taking it for granted, that the greatest part of his Substance must have been Spent in ragouts and fricassees. The Germans,

when they Speak of a man that has made away with all that he had. Say, Er hat aljein gtit verfuffen; that is, he has drank all his money, drinking being the favourite occupation of a German; he, as well as the Frenchman, imagines a man must certainly have appropriated the greatest part of his expence, to gratify the passion most prevalent in the generality of people in the ■country where lie lives; now I should be glad, if any virtuofo in language would furnish me with a term, to expreSs a West-Indian’s Spending his estate ; should it not be, he dressed away his fortune, or he forgot it ?
I might very properly be Said, to have dressed, forgot, and run out my estate. I had granted annuities to the amount of leven hundred and fifty pounds, and my -merchant was now in advance for me up-
G 2	wards

( 124 )
v/ards of twenty thouSand pounds, which was very near the whole value of my plantation ; for although I first had, at my father’s death, a real income of three thousand pounds a year; yet, as West-India estates Seldom Sell for more than eight or nine year’s purchaSe, I had almost gone to the extremity of mine. Commiffion now absolutely refuSed to advance me any farther Sums of money, and I was under the necessity of changing my correspondent, that I might raiSe a Small Sum for preSent Subsistence.
My new correlpondent took the debt I owed com.miffion upon himfelf, and advanced what I wanted for preSent uSe; but what v/ith interest and premium, I paid at the rate of eight percent, for the,money ; the unfortunate, or rather thoSe in distreSs, are Subjedt to the greatest impofitions. My new correspondent infisted upon my ensuring my life; otherwise he threatened to fend a pov/er of attorney to Jamaica, to have my estate Sold for the payment of his debt.
Want, which hitherto had been unknown to me, now began to pinch me ; my chief dependance for the fucceSs of my petition, was being admitted into the young club at Arthur’s ; I was then in the hat, and Sparkle

kle assured me would Soon be put up. I endeavoured still to keep up the appearance of a man of fortune, by felling off my trinkets, as I had occafion, for ready cash; my original Madona by Guido, was fit up at an audlion, and I had the mortification to hear it deemed, by Some of the principal connoisseurs, a wretched copy; none of them would bid for it; at which I was ib extremely piqued, that I ordered it to be taken down.
My mornings uSed generally to be taken up, in company with many worthy members of the legissative body, in lounging and eating fruit at Betty’s in St. James’s street. The important evening that was to determine my fate at Arthur’s, at length arrived ; I went to the room below, that I might know the iffue of my eleDion as Soon as it should happen ; when I thought the balloting was over, I called for the waiter, and ashed, with a faultering voice, v/hat had been the fate of Mr. Grant; to which he replied, he is rejedted. Heavens, what were my feelings at this news! but my grief was Soon changed to the highest pitch of indignation and reSentment, when the waiter farther told me, that I had not a fingle affirmative; So that my friend Sparkle must have given me a negative, as
G 3	well

well as the rest of the club, that had a defign to exclude me. I went the next morning to his houSe beSore he was up; and told him, that I inSisted upon his going with me that instant to the grove in Hyde'park; at which he was So thunderstruck, that he fainted away in his bed; and, when he recovered from his Swoon, had the meanneSs to kiSs my hand, which he bathed with tears. I felt So great a contempt for this puSillanimity, that I Suddenly left him, and gratified my relent-ment, by telling every body I met, what had passed that morning between us.
I still continued very bufy in forw^arding my petition; and my antagonist, finding he should have Some difficulty,, offered me Seven hundred pounds to withdraw my petition; which, after a short time that I took to confider of it, I accepted of; to which I was the more eaSily induced, as Several of my creditors began to plague me a good deal.
My finances now growing daily lower, I parted with my Guido for fifty pounds, and fold my furniture, horfes, and equipages, and, with fome of the money they produced, stopt the mouths of thoSe creditors, who were loudest and most importunate, reserving twenty guineas for my

I accordingly repaired to Portsmouth, embarked in one of the tranlports, the captain of which had been mate with Rudder, and consequently knew me. I had obtained the General’s permishon to land in the first boat that a as ordered on shore; and, having a great deSire to fignalize my-felf, at least twenty yards before the divi-fion reached the Beech, I jumped out of the boat, and marched to Shore. The issue of the first attack upon that issand is very well known ; as we were retreating in con-fufion to our boats, I received a mulket-ball in my right temple which went out of my head at the oppofite one. I was inSenSible of the wound by the stupifadtion it occafioned; from which, when I recovered, I found mySelf in the arms of a Sailor lifting me up the ship’s fide; I was, by this wound, rendered incapable of ler-vice during the Siege of the fortrefs, and returned to England in one of the transports, that came for fresh provisions for

¥ One day heard, by accident, that the wine-merchant in St. Catharine’s, who had Served me by Lyndamira’s recommendation, had given instrudlions to his attorney to arrest she. The only remaining Servant, that I now had with me, told me he had likewise been informed there was ano-her writ out against me, and that I was hourly in danger of being arrested. I thought now there v/as no time to be lost ; I therefore that evening, as Soon as it was dark, took the only five pieces I had remaining, a shirt, and pair of stockings,
and.

( 129 )
and went to an alehouSe near Temple-bar 5. where, aSter I had taken Some refreshment, enquired for a ready-furnished lodging, and was conduced to a woman that let lodgings, who was retailing greens on a stall hard by ; she told me she had lodgings of all prices, from half-a-crown as low as fix-pence a week; I deSired her to shew me one of a middling price, which, she Said» she could do exadtly, for that a gentleman, that had enlisted in the guards, had gone out of a very pretty apartment but last week, which I might have, if I choSe it, for eighteen pence a week.
I defired her to conduct me to it immediately, as I had been up very early that morning, I was much inclined to steep; according to my defire she condudfced me to Fetter-lane, and, after turning two or three times in an alley, in which it was im-poshble for two people to walk a breast, we climbed up four pair of stairs, and entered a room about feven feet in length by four in breadth, the bed turned up; but wher> it was let down, there was no possibility of walking on the floor, as it engrossed the whole area of the room, except a very Small Space. There was a stove fixed to the freehold, and the tongs, shovel, and poker were chained to the chimney-place.

familiar conversation; at the end of which my neighbour very obligingly expressed a defire of our living upon a Sociable footing, and invited me next morning to breakfast ; which was the betenning of a friend-ly intercourse that lasted four months.
This gentleman was a native of Scotland, named Murdo; he was a perSon post Sessed of a natural strength of parts, very properly denominated mother-wit; he was bred at the univerfity of Edingburgh, and had been usher at a board in g-School near London ; but his extravagance had obliged him to hide himSelf in thefe lofty regions. He informed me, that he was employed by a certain bookfeller, who does not live five miles from Temple-bar, by which he earned just enough to fubfist upon; he Said his chief bufineSs was writing articles in the Review, vrhich Vv'as no deSpicable branch of authorship, as now and then he got a few pieces from a bookfeller to puff off his publications; that he was under a neceshty of writing a panegyric upon all the books published by the bookfeller before-mentioned, as he was the only perlbn, (except the printer’s devilj that knew where he was le-creted ; and he had often threatened, in cafe he was Sparing of his praiSes, that he (the bookfeller) would immediately give information
«
*
( ^32 )
mation to his creditors of the place of his abode.
My whole stock being expended, I entreated Murdo to intercede with his book-feller for employment for me in the literary way; I was deSired to give a Specimen of my style and manner of writing, which did not meet with that approbation I had the vanity to think they deServed; but as there was, at that tim.e, a Scarcity of pens, for which the London bookSellers had just, at that period, a particular call, I was engaged to critidle the two first volumes that appeared of one of the most valuable histories in the English, or any other language; the author, it Seems, had Sold the original to a bookSeller in Edinburgh, v/ho had printed Some thouSand copies of it in that city, which he had Sent up to London ; the London bookSellers thought this an invafion on their ideal right of Selling the first publication of all books written in his Majesty’s dominions; and in order to throw a damp upon the Sale of the work, Set all their Garreteers and Reviewers.
to work, to prejudice the public against «
It.	*
I now commenced author, and considered myStlf as a barister retained in a bad
cauSe, who looks upon himSelf as by no

( IJ? )
means reSponfible for the oppreshon of right, as he is adling merely in his profeS-fion. The work was cenSured with the most unjustifiable acrimony; it was accuSed of inculcating arbitrary and atheistical principles, and deemed a Scandal and reproach to a nation. So remarkable for its love of liberty and humanity.
The united efforts of the Scribbling tribe Succeeded So well in this matter, that the Edinburgh bookSeller found himSelf obliged to let in Murdo’s benefadlor for a. part; and Soon after that was effedled, we bestowed upon it the most hyperbolical panegyrics ; my ethereal companion was generally appointed to write the Monthly catalogue in one of the Reviews, part of which I commonly executed ; but our ap-plauSe or cenSure, was distributed according to the diredtions of the bookSeller, which we endeavoured Scrupuloufiy to follow.
Murdo often bewailed in Secret thele shackles, that were placed on the human understanding:	but neceshty had no law ;
we, had only this cruel alternative remaining, either to prostitute our pens, or die of hunger.
O
Murdo uSed on Sundays to dine in com-pany with the Society of reviewers, many of whom, he affared me, were men of
learn-
<•
( 134 )
learning and merit, but, like ourSelves,
. had their genius’s cramped by the Sordid influence of their mercenary bookSellers. I was employed as digester, or colledlor, for the magazine, as well as reviewer ; I wrote a collebfion of riddles and conundrums, which Murdo told me Some of the members of the club envied me the honour of; one gentleman in particular, who, ^ few years ago, wrote Jenny’s Vvshim, or the places of abode of the prirjcipal people in London, was mightily pleaSed with them : He aS-fared me, my reputation was So great, that I flrould be a very acceptable guest to the Society, and Said, the very next Sunday he would introduce me.
As I was returning from the Park on the Sabbath, I perceived a man folkiwing me through the alleys ; it was with difliculty I could give him the flip, and as I concluded it was a bailiff who wanted to find out the place of my abode, I never stirred out till it it was ten at night, and would open my door to no per Son that I had nt;t first reconnoitred through a little hole in my door, vrhich I bored for that purpoSe.
My neighbour, Murdo, according to his promile, conduced me, the Sunday following, to the ordinary he had mentioned;
and in our way thither told me, that I must
pay
m
( *35 )
pay great attention to a gentleman who would Sit in the armed chair, with his back to the fire ; Sor, continued he, he is a m.an of fix thousand pounds a year, and the fo-ciety think themSelves greatly honoured by his company; but, for my own part, I think any man, let his fortune be ever Ib great, does a gentleman born very little honour by his acquaintance ; and, for my own part, I was a better gentleman five hundred years ago than I am now; but as to the gentleman I was fpeaking of, his father kept a School in a Small village in Aberdeen-shire, and this man, who is novr So great,,
I do not SuppoSe ever wore shoes and stockings till he was twelve years old. When he first came up to London in Search of adventures, I have been very certainly informed, he kept a day fchool in a garret in the Hay market. Before he embarked for Jamaica, he alked the advice of his friends, whether he should praDile the law or phyfic in that place *, who recommended the latter; as a total ignorance was more eafily detedl-ed in the former: he accordingly, upon his arrival, gave it out, that he intended to praDiSe phyfic ; a gentleman of considerable property Soon after happening to be . taken dangeroufiy ill, when all the rest of the faculty had given him over, his family,
as
( }
as a last effort, called in this mew dodlor, lately arrived Srom Bingland; when he came to the patient, he put on the appearance of proSoLind knowledge, and declared him in eminent danger; and (Said he to the lady oS the houfe) he will certainly die, if you do not take Tent: Anglice Care: he repeated this Several times, and the good lady really imagining he had preScribed Tent wine, gave the patient a pint that evening, which flung him into a profule perlpiration, and Saved his liSe. His reputation was established by this accident, and he got a confiderable deal of money.
-At length, by wriggling and tv/isting, he procured a good employment in the island, where he laid a more Solid foundation of his wealth by marriage, upon which he raiSed the great Superstrudlure we See him poffessed of; to which he had not a a little added by a Second marriage to a widow past 8o, and has disappointed her great grandchildren of a confiderable estate they expedled. As he is a dabler in astronomy, what brings him to our meeting is the company of Mr. Tangent, the mathematician, who constantly attends : Mr. Tangent, you must know. Sir, is a man of an amiable charader, benevolent and friendly;
but
/
C 137 )
but his intenSe application to geometry, has rendered him unfit for company ; he win-fit for a whole evening without opening his lips, with his eyes fixed either upon the cieling or the fire. I once crossed over from GlaS-gow to Carickfergus with him in the Same ^ vessel, and there arole So violent a storm, that the master declared we were in the greatest danger; Tangent was at that time in the cabin, with his parabolas and hyperbolas before him, and when the whole crew, trembling like alpin leaves, were assembled on their knees upon deck, he continued to work his proposition with the Same com-poSure as if we had been riding at anchor. Next to him you will lee a Perlbn who has acquired great reputation in the literary world, but I think very undeServedly; his history is So well known, that I shall not enlarge upon it; his .name is PompoSo. There are many more minor wits, of little note, who ferve to fill the table, and laugh at the hon mots of the great ones: We Sat down to a Sparing board, and the conversation was at first general; each displaying his depth in politics: The Gentleman whoSe history Murdo did not chuSe to enlarge upon, named PompoSo, Seemed to be a tory
in his principles, and I perceived a Sort of
jealouSy
y.%
( )
jealouSy between him and my Sriend, by the drynels and acrimony oS their replies j at last Murdo’s pride was piqued, and he talked much of the Advantages a good origin was of; and that, though riches at-tradled power and relpedt in this part of the kingdom, yet in his country a man’s family was very much conSidercd : he was going on in this strain, when the gentleman in the armed chair cried, tollater Mur do., tollater Murdo; which, to my great shrprile, and to poor Murdo’s intire dif-confiture, railed a Sudden fit of laughter, inlbmuch that Murdo could not withstand it; as loon as he could with decency retire, he took his leave.
When Murdo was gone, I took an opportunity of waking Tangent out of a re-virie, by defiring him to explain to me the wit of what the gentleman in the great chair had Said; why. Sir, Said he, Murdo is a very honest fellow, and I love him; but he has the infatuation to boast of the nobility of his parentage before us, who, he knows, are well acquainted with his origin : Sir, you must know (he continued) Murdo’s father was a caudey, or porter, in the city of Edinburgh, and being protected by the regent of the high School, his
Son
9
/
( 139 )
ton was admitted a janitor ; now, yoa muft know, a janitor is a poor boy, that has his Schoolingand undergoes the drudgery‘ of Sweeping the Schools, and ringing the bell, and when a delinquent is lentenced to undergo fiagellation, he hoists him upon his back ; now the custom is, when a boy is to be whipped, Sor the regent to Say, tollater-, for example, if Murdo was the perSon, the master would cry out, tollater.^ Murdo : There is one part of your account of Murdo that I cannot agree in, interrupted Pompofo; Sir, you Said he was a very honest man; now. Sir, I do lay it down as a certain pofition, that a man who has any ways contributed, diredly or indi-redSly, to propagate atheiSm and infidelity, must be a man of no principle; Murda was the publisher of the posthumous works ' of an infidel; now, Mr. Tangent, the thing strikes me in this light, the atheist I allude to, loaded the cannon with Swan shot, and levelled it at human kind, and Murdo was the little, dirty, pitiful Scoundrel that let it : off for half a crown: Much more conversation passed, and I staid till all the company was gone, except tangent, who knowing 'that I was a neighbour of Murdo’s, defired that I would accompany him the Sunday
fd-
( 1,40 )
Sollov/ing to take a family dinner with him’, and added, that he dined precisely at two.
The Sunday after, Murdo led me to Tangent’s apartment, which was up two pair of stairs backwards, in a little alley going from Lincoln’s Inn-Fields to Holborn near a certain great houSe, where, in the decline of my grandeur, I had once got admittance ; we enquired at the door whether Mr. Tangent was at home, and were an-fwered by the maid that he had come home at one o’clock that morning, but had not yet breakfasted; at which we both expressed our astonishment; why. Sir, Said she, he has never been to bed, I went into his room this morning at nine o’clock to light his fire, but he would not let me; the clock struck one as we were mounting to the Sublime regions of geometry; the door of his bedchamber was a-jar, and by pushing it, we got admittance unperceived by the mathematician ; the fun was shining extremely bright diredliy oppofite to him., through four circular holes in the window-shutters, which made broad day-light in the room ; two burning candles stood by him, which were reduced to the length of an inch each, he had a state before him, filled from top to bottom with a

round him without difturbing him, and I
believe if all the drums of the three regiments of guards had been beating in his room, he would not have perceived them ; at last Murdo took him by the fieeve ; he rubbed his eyes, and, staring him in the face, got up, and ashed him, what could bring him there So early in the morning ? We told him, that we had come to dine with him agreeable to our promiSes, and shat it only wanted an hour to the time appointed ; being perSuaded by the height of the Sun, of the truth of our assertion, he rung the bell, sticks were ordered up to light the fire, the bellows were thrown down in reaching for the coal-tub, the shovel was knocked against the fender, which, upon the whole, as to agreeableneSs of found, cleanlineSs and regularity of appearance, formed one of the most pleafing Scenes it is possible to conceive.
Our philosopher had forgot to order any dinner the day before, and had it not been been for a few steaks his landlady fpared him from a rump of beef she had in Salt, and Some bread and cheele, we might have dined upon Signs and tangents.
Matters being put to rights, our dinner Served up, and had drank a glaSs of execrable port-wine, which was brought from
the
( 142 )
the alehoule over the way in a half-pint-decanter, with a Single glaSs, which Served us all three; the philoSopher, in the heat of his argument with Murdo, upon the origin of evil, having occafion to make an urinal evacuation, went to the bed-fide, and, without o.nce stopping his harangue, with all the folemnity imaginable, after having fatisfied this natural call, came back ' to his feat, with the earthen vaSe in his hand, which he placed upon the table, with its Smoaking contents.

My creditors now found out the place

Various were the stratagems fallen upon to arrest me, but none of them hitherto Succeeded ; I was very near being enSnared by one : A man one morning knocked at iny door;

after I had taken a view of him, and not liking his countenance, defired to know his buSineSs; he anSwered there was a clergyman below, who was just arrived from Jamaica, and that my brother, having heard of my distreSs, had Sent me a preSent by him. I defired the clergyman would shew himSelf in the alley below, which he immediately did, and there appeared a very decent figure in canonicals, 'who confirmed what the messenger had told me; and farther added, he had fbme thing of conSequence to communicate to me, which required privacy. As I knew Humphrey’s humane dilpofition, I thought this matter not unlikely, and was upon the point of opening the door to the clergyman ; but thinking it more prudent to have a farther proof of his not being an impostor, I defired him to return into the alley below, and when he was there, flung down a sheet of paper, with this verSe written upon it:

I continued thus confined for the Space of eight months, admitting no creature into my apartment, except the printer’s devil, that uSed to bring the proofs of the Review, and Magazine, in which I was still employed. One morning, however, when a gentleman of this diabolical Species, gave the uSual tap at the door, I peeped, as was my custom,- but perceived a difference in the features of this boy, from thoSe of the boy that uSually attended me; but as his hands were filled with sheets of printed paper, I concluded, without ashing, that the printer had accidentally changed his messenger; to my fatal experience, however, I found mySelf mistaken; for I had no Sooner put my hand out to rake the papers, but he laid hold of it, and claimed me as his priSoner, at the Suit of my wine-merchant; I shut the door upon him, imagining as he had not taken abSolute corporal possession of me, that still I was at large ; but I was Soon convinced I lay under a mistake likewiSe in this particular; for my door was almost instantaneoussy broke to pieces, and I was hurried away to the King’s-bench priSon in the Borough.
Here I continued for three weeks, during which time my health Suffered daily, for want of wholeSome and Sufficient food.

Being now enlarged, with ten guineas in my pocket, I thought mySelf no inconfide-rable perSon; but two days after I got my liberty, I was again laid fast; I lived in priSon till I had Spent my money, and pawn -ed all my clothes, except a very shabby Suit, which hardly concealed my nakednest. I at last took advantage of the compulfive clauSe in the Ad; of inSolvency, and was, what is vulgarly called, white-washed.
I was now abandoned by every creature of my acquaintance, even my bookSeller delerted me, and Murdo would no longer open his friendly door to my neceshtous rap. My time was chiesty fpent in night-houfes near St. Giles’s, where I uSed to endeavour to drown my cares in purl and gin;' but, alas ! my anxiety only returned the day following with ten-fold bitternels.
I was at last adviSed to take orders, and return to the West-Indies; as I should, at least by that means, get the twenty guineas bounty, bestowed upon Protestant clergy-

It was to no purpoSe that I made application to leveral. So that I at last abandoned the thought of taking the gown.
After I had drawn a trifle from everv creole
¥
in London, who gave me money to be freed from my importunity, and was forbid their doors under pain of corporal punishment, I was at last reduced So low, that I was obliged to beg half-pence of people as they went along in the street; in Some of thele mendicant peregrinations, I got acquainted with a countryman, who had been a captain in the army, and was obliged to shift in the fame manner that I was.
About this time a considerable premium was offered at Guild-hall by the city of London, for able-bodied men, that would enlist in his Majesty’s Service; the reward, I confels, allured me to go and offer mySelf; but I relembled So much Scrub in the Stratagem, that I was rejedted upon account of my exceshve meagreneSs.

( 147 )
miseries I Suffered were So great, that, was 1 to represent them to the reader, they would, form but diSagreeable images, and. would rather fill him with horror, than a-mazement.
One day, as I was posted in the passage that leads from the Mall in St. James’s park to Spring-garden, entreating the benefactions of the charitably-diSpoSed, one of my Bagnio-attendants, whom I had diSmiS-Sed when I retired to my lofty apartment ' near Fetter-lane, happened to pals by ; the fellow, with difficulty, recolledled me : Fie told me, “ Since he left my Service, he had “ lived with Lyndamira, who was now in very affluent keeping, by the heir appa-“ rent of a peer of the realm, who had “ parted with his wife upon her account, “ and was running into certain ruin and “ destrudtion, to gratify her extravagance. He added, “ that she had a large houfe in “ Harley-street, [Cavendish-Square, where “ she had lived fince she left Flanders; but, to his certain knowledge, had never been in a Convent, or ever intended it.” I was not at all Sorry to hear, that Lyndamira was now in London, as I took it for granted, if she did but know of my circumstances, in common gratitude, she would assist me to the utmost of her power. The
H 2	re-
y
t
/
( 148 )
restedtion upon this lucky accident afforded no Small pleaSure, and I reSolved, the next morning, to wait upon her, to inform her, that she had now an opportunity of shewing that affedcion and regard she always So strongly professed for me.
I got up very early the day following, had my beard shaved, and rigged myfelf out in the completest manner my preSent narrow affairs would permit, and went to Lyndamira’s door; which was opened by a Servant in rich livery; who, upon my telling him, that I had an affair of conSe-. quence to impart to his lady, defired me to wait in the Hall, and went up stairs; during the time that L was left in the Hall, which was near two hours, the maids were continually running up and down Stairs, and whiSpered So loud, that I could overhear all their conversation ; by which I gathered, the master v/as in the country, and that another had that night been the happy man.
I was at length defired to walk up stairs; when I entered the room, I could perceive that she immediately recolledled me ; but, without moving from her chair, or alking me to fit down, she defired to know what very particular bufineSs 1 had to tell her of ?
I painted my distressed condition in as live- -
t
w
f
( 149 )
ly colours as I was master of, which I thought would have melted the heart, even
o
of a Cherokee, and ended my story, by putting her in mind of the pecuniary obligations she even now was daily laying under to me, and concluded, by deSiring her friendly assistance.
She told me, she was not anSwerable for the distresses I had brought upon mySelf by my own folly and extravagance ; that it was not in her power to assist me, and heartily wished me a good morning.
I was So shocked at this exceSs of ingratitude, that I could not help upbraiding her in the Severest terms: “ Go, thou most “ ungrateful, thou vilest of mortals (Said I) “ it is a reproach to the world, that a mon-“ ster, like you, has been hitherto Suffered to “ diSgrace the name of human nature.’*, Upon which she started up in a fury, and rung the bell with the greatest violence. I still continued to give vent to my indignation, and two Servants came up before I had finished. She told them to kick me down stairs immediately; that I had affronted her in the grossest manner. The order was no Sooner given, than it was executed' by theSe minions of lust and prosti-‘ gacy; in short, I was So terribly bruiSed, that I felt the blows a month after, which
H 3	effe-
( ISO )
effedlually prevented me Srom ever paying any more vifits to this votary oS Penus ve-nalis.
Although neceffity constrained me to stoop to things much below my inclinations, yet I had still a fparkof West-indian pride remaining in my composition. It ^ was with the utmost remorSe I ressedted upon the Servile, infamous life I was leading, and, in my heart, would have preferred death itSelf to the state I was reduced to. My fall was great, from the most affluent circumstances, from the company of kings and peers of the realm, I deScended to absolute beggary, and the Ibciety of hackney-coachmen and link-boys. In Ibme of my melancholy hours I Sometimes deliberated with mySelf, whether a man, fallen as I was, had not a just power of divesting him-Self of life ?
I could not help accufing the laws of too , great rigour and Severity towards thoSe who put a period to their lives by their own hands. A felo de fe forfeits all his goods and chattels, real and perSonal, and his body being buried where two high-ways meet, has a stake drove through the middle of it, as a mark of the greatest infamy. Why am I to be deterred from putting an end ' to my pains, and to be deprived of a remedy
(150
medy I am master of, when I am groaning under a load of miSery, indigence, and contempt ? Put the cafe of a man that is eighty years of age, or upwards, affiidted with the stone, racked by the gout, obliged to beg his bread from door to door, without the possibility, or a most distant hope, of being able to benefit himSelf, or any member of Society; can it be conceived he has not a full right to make ufe of a remedy he is invested with by providence ? Am I to be forced and compelled to bear my part in a Society I defire no longer to be a member of; on the contrary, that I wish ardently to quit ? And am I under a neceff lity of performing a contract, entered into and stipulated without my privity or con-fent ? Society is founded upon mutual or reciprocal advantages; but when it be- . comes irkSome and troubleSome to me, I know no reaSon why I may not renounce it ? If life has been given me as a favour. Surely I may give back that favour when it is no longer Such ; but, on the contrary, is a punishment ? When the cauSe ceaSes, the effedl ought likewile to ceaSe ; am I to remain a member of the common-wealth when I reap no advantage from any civil institution ? Can my countrymen be lb unreasonable as to demand So unequal a divi-

fion of their advantages, and my mifery ? And is it pojfible that the Almighty should differ So widely, from all human benefactors, as to condemn me to preServe a bounty, that is become a burthen to me ? But then. Say the wiSe philoSophers of the age : You disturb the order of providence and nature; God hath joined your Soul to your body, and, by Separating them, you oppoSe his defigns. Do I disturb the order of providence by altering the modifications of matter ? No, I only uSe the right that has been given me, and, in that fenie, 1 may disturb all nature at my will and pleaSure, without oppofing the views or intention of providence. When my foul shall be Separated from my body, will there exist lest' order or perfecstion in the creation ? Will it be the least loSs to human nature, or will the works of the Creator lofe any part of their immenfity, when my body is changed into a mushroom, an ear of barley, or an aSparagus Will it not be a work equally worthy of the hands of nature ^ And my Soul, being freed from its human trappings, can loSe no part whatever of its excellence. It is human pride alone that makes us deaf to the force and strength of thele arguments. We are strangers to our ovrn in-
conSiderableneSs, and imagine the annihilation
o
t
( 153 )
tlon of a being, ib perfect as ourfelves,
would derogate Srom all nature. But we never ressedt, that a man more or leSs in the world, nay, all human kind together, ten thouSand myriads of beings like ourfelves, are but a Subtile atoin, which God perceives / but from the immenfity of his knowledge.
Men are however apt to delpair too Soon, and give up all for lost, when there is a probability of things taking a better or more favourable turn. Men that are vapoured and low-fpirited, generally looked upon the objedls of this life through a deceitful medium, and conSider that as unalterably fixed, which time, patience, or industry might very poshbly change to their advantage. Thefe were the thoughts, however unbecoming a Christian, that uSed frequently to occur to me in my frantic or melancholy hours; and to my shame let me Say it,' The poshbility of an alteration of circumstances, was one confideration that prevented me from putting a period to my , life by my own hand *. I was willing to rish it in my country’s Service; but had been rejedled, on account of exceffive mea-greneSs, when I offered myfelf at Guildhall. The army, however, was the profeS-

fion I reSolved to follow; which I now found an opportunity of engaging in, by enlisting in the Eashindia Company’s Service, in which the extreme meagrenels of my perSon was no objeftion Sufficient to exclude me. I repaired to the place of rendezvous appointed by the printed bill; and after I had been kept three days in a state of ebriety, took the oaths of'allegiance to his Majesty, and fidelity to my masters the honourable Court of Diredors. The Serjeant, under whom I had entered, put me on board a tender, with thirty other recruits, to go down to the veffeJ, that was lying off Woolwich.
My fellow-Soldicrs were in the Same tattered condition that I was; five of them were felons come out of Newgate, whoSe lives were Spared upon condition they bore arms. We formed, upon the whole, a company not unlike Falstaff’s, having literally only a shirt and half between the wffiole thirty ; before we v/ere permitted to go from our quarters at the Serjeant’s houSe, we were all hand-cuffed, and chained in pairs, and were stung into the tender, which lay along Tower-wharf, like fb many bales of wool: When the whole company was stowed, our fetters were taken off, which feemed to affed the greatest part of my feliow-Sol-
diers with no warhs of extraordinary plea-

( 155 )
Sure, which I attributed to their having long been us’d to much worSe treatment.Thepurity and elegance of our conversation may be eaSily conceived ; but as I choSe to intermix but very little in it, I was looked upon as a Sullen, worthleSs fellow, and now and then received a blow in my face or stomach, by way of bringing me to mySelf.
As my Sufferings had impaired my health, and consequently reduced my strength, I was obliged to let theSe inSuIts paSs unre-' venged. My Submishon only provoked
my tyrants the more, and one of the late inhabitants of Newgate, after he had knocked me down, stampt with his feet upon my face Several times, and almost beat my nofe fiat by the repeated kicks he gave it with the edge of the heel of his shoe, wdiich was plaited vrith iron; the life of a galley-stave is paradife to what I Suffered during the passage down to the ship; my former life now appeared ely-fium, and I formed a reSolution of defert-ing, as Soon as I should find it pradlicable.
When we arrived at the ship, we were better regulated, and divided into messes; we had the liberty of writing to our friends before the ship unmoored; and as I was the only perSon, among the recruits, that
could read or write, I was obliged to write
the
#
( 156 )
the letters of the whole company; from which employment I was called the Schoolmaster. The ship./got the first tide as far as Shippey ; but just at the time the anchor was going to be cast, we run upon a bank ; every thing was now in an uproar and con-fuSion; all the boats were hoisted out, and the vessels, that were at anchor near that place. Sent their boats and men to our aS-fistance; whilst things were in this confu-fion, I could not forbear keeping my eye upon a cock we had in tow, which was unoccupied ; and when all were intent upon the Sate of the ship, I got into it unperceived, cut the rope by which it was fastened, and put off aloxie towards the shore; at which I Soon arrived, and, letting the boat go a-drift, run up in the country.
I begged my way to Rochester, where I propoSed to halt, till I should receive an anSwer to a propoSal I intended to make my. correspondent, with regard to my return to Jamaica, where I thought I might expe& relief, either from my brother Humphrey, or Eugenio.
I frequently posted my Self at the door of Some inn, to imiportune the travellers that -should stop there ; one day, when I was thus placed, a post-chaiSe from Canterbury strove into the yard, and I thought the faces
of
• '
( 157 )
oS one oS the perSons in it reSembled Eugenio ; I was So transported at this appearance, that I Scarce had strength Sufficient to bear me to the post-chaiSe; when I was a little recovered, I went to the boy that drove it, and interrogated him about the perSons he had brought *, he told me they came from Dover, and believed landed there from a ship lately arrived from the West-indies. Not Satisfied with this anSwer, I walked backwards and forwards before the windows of the room into which the gentlemen had o-one ; and was at last convinced
O	^
that one of them w^as Eugenio; upon this perSuafion I went to my room, and, having borrowed pen and ink, wrote a line, by which I informed him, that his old friend and master, Jeremiah Grant, was then at Rochester, and, if agreeable, v^ould v/ait upon him. I received an anfwer immediately, in which he expressed the utmost impatience to fee me, and, at the Same time, informed me, that his principal errand to Europe was to find me out.
I forthwith shaved, and made mySelf the most decent figure I could; but still my dreSs betrayed figns of the greatest indigence ; for I was dressed without a shirt, in a brown coat, waistcoat, and breeches, value fifteen pence, a pair of black-worsted
stock-
\
(I5S)
stockings, darned with a variety oS coloured worsted, lb that it was difficult to aScertain the original colour oS which they were made; my shoes were flip-shod, without any buckles, and the wig, that graced my head, v/as a dark grizzle, which had formerly been put to the the uSe of rubbing shoes, when it was in the occupation of its late master,, who was a shoe-black, that keeps his stand in New-round-court in the Strand; my hat had the greatest part of the flap cut off, in order to make it look like a Jockey’s cap.
In this dreSs I entered the room; where Eugenio was Sitting ; when I approached, ,I perceived that he changed colour, and,, when he came to embrace me, the briny tears flowed down his cheeks with great' profufion ; he made me fit down, and after we had taken a bumper of v/ine to recruit our Ipirits, he began as follows:	“ My
“ dear Jerry, it is now about eight “ months fince the conveyance of your e-“ state to Mr. ----- the merchant came “ out to be register’d; by the Same “ vessel I likewise heard, that you was ‘‘ reduced to the greatest indigence and “ milery. As Soon as I was well affured “ of this matter, I reSolved to go to Eng-“ land, where I intended to find you our,
and
I
t
( *59 )
“ and relieve you as Sar as my circumstances
“ would allow.” I thanked him Sor his
/
generous and almost unprecedented marks of friendship/, and told him, I was SenSible my conduct in life had been extravagant, giddy, and very exceptionable, and I was conScious I was very undeServing of the regard ot any of my friends; he replied, “ that he knew it was his duty to ashst me, “ and what he was going to do, was ab-“ Iblutely incumbent upon him, and there-“ fore pretended to no very great merit . “ in it.”
We staid at Rochester till a very decent Suit of clothes were made for me, and I was otherv/iSe anSwerably equipped. Eugenio gave me a purSe of twenty guineas, and niade over to me the annuity I had formerly given him, payable quarterly into my own hands.
When I arrived in London, I immediately went to the coffee-room below at Arthur’s, where I Saw many of my old acquaintances, among the rest, the earl of Sparkle, vsho came up to me with an Intention of beginning a conversation ; but I turned round upon my heel, and went to the Scotch dodlor, that had travelled with his lordship, and entered into conversation with him.
This
• ^
( 1)
This gentleman told me, that Durlach, m'y SwiSs governor, after he left me, had travelled with a Dutch baron ; and, upon his return to Holland, had commenced an intrigue with a burgo-master’s wife ; which had been discovered, and Durlach, in con-Sequence of that diScqvery, Sentenced to have all his real and perSonal estate confiscated, and be impriSoned during life; he added, that, for preSent fubfistence, he was engaged in a very arduous undertaking, which was a transsation of TristramShandy into French.
The Sunday after, 1 went to the Ordinary where Murdo, Tangent, Pompofo, and the other Reviewers uSually met, where I was courteoussy received, and invited to honour the Society every Sunday whilst I staid in town. I gave Murdo five pieces, for which he told me, he would celebrate my praiSes in a Romance, his bookSeller had hired him to write ; I told him, as to that, I dcSired to be excufed, and wanted no retaliation whatever. He then began to expatiate upon the hardships he daily underwent, from the avarice and conceited io;norance of his bookSeller. He Said, that
O	'
he had been hired by him to write a Dramatic pastoral to a Set of Scenes a certain manager had got painted; but, after fix
-	'	weeks
•	s
/
( )
weeks hard labour, his piece was deemed improper to Suit the Scenery. I took my leave of this Society, with an intention of never returning to it more.
Whilst I was'thus diverting mySelf in looking into the Several places, which I had formerly frequented, either in the meridian of my grandeur, or in my adverSity; an account was brought from Jamaica of the death of my brother Humphrey ; it feems he died intestate, and never could be pre-vai'ed upon to make a Will, though he had been much pressed to it in his last fick-neSs by his wife: She represented to him the partiality of his father; but he constantly refisted her Solicitations, alledging, that his father’s injustice to him, was no reaSon that he should do what he thought wrong in another. The Speaker and he had continued their animofities after I had left Jamaica; with which Humphrey’s tender heart was Sorely tired, and at last entirely broken.
“ Alas! (Said he to his friends that were standing round his bed, dissolved in tears) “ I die a martyr to the cruelty and injustice, “ to the rancorous persecution of that “ western Baftlides\ no Bashaw, no Turk, “ or MoScovite, could have a heart more “ stony, or Surrounded by a thicker coat of

“ the most flinty adamant. Sooner or “ later,' my dearest friends, the day will “ come, and fbme of you, I hope, will live “ to fee, when that hand, the justice of “ which has been revered and acknowledge “ ed in every climate, and age, and amongst “ all conditions, ranks, and Ibrts of men, “ of all callings, classes, and denominations, “ the time will comie, my dearest and affec-“ donate friends, I fay, when he will re-“ ceive the proper reward for the calamity, the poignant grief, the melancholy hours, “ he has caufed to your poor, afflidled “ friend, Humphrey Grant. From the “ very dawning of my infancy, fortune, methinks, has made it her bufineSs and “ delight to make Iport with me, my mo-“ ther’s ill-plaCed, cruel, and inhuman par-“ tiality, my father’s blind acquiefcence in ‘‘ whatever she pleaSed or thought proper to “ do, or didlate,” -—Here death interrupted liis fpeech. By the death of my brother Humphrey, I now became intitled to his plantation of High-grumps, chargeable with his wife’s dower, or thirds, at common law. Eugenio adviSed me, by all means, to return to Jamaica, to fettle my late brother’s affairs, as there was no probability of their being So well done by attorney, as if I was to be
preSent; another rnotive was very strong
to
( '63 )
to induce me to take the voyage, which was, the completion of my engagement to Lucinda; that divine creature was still living in Kingston, and, what was very remarkable, never had mentioned my name Since 1 Ib shamefully abandoned her.
The news of my brother’s death came by a running ship, which arrived in Aei-gust; and as my friend advifed as Speedy a return as possible, I reSolved to go to Falmouth, and embark in the Packet; Eugenio agreed to accompany me to Plymouth, where he intended to conSult the celebrated Dr. Huxham, upon a stubborn Scorbutic complaint that had long hung upon him.
My friend told me, he had planned a Scheme of vengeance, which, he Said, it would be the only proper vengeance to execute upon Lyndamira, before we left Lon-dpn.
Eugenio had got a trusty Servant, that he could confide in, whom he dressed in a rich Suit of clothes, hired of a shopkeeper in Monmouth-street; this fellow, by the friendly mediation of a lady, that lives in Bolton-row, Piccadilly, got introduced to Lyndamira, and made an appointment to carry her in his chaiSe to EpSom, where they were to Spend the evening. She, according to the engagement, went down

with him; and, when she was afieep, he took away every part of her dreSs, except the linnen mirment she then had on, which he brought away, and left her to make the best of her way to London in her naked condition.
When the man arrived in London, loaded with the meretricious Spoils, we Set out to enjoy her confufion and distreSs; and drove to the very houle, where we knew she was, and had the Satisfadlion to lee her in the public kitchen of the inn with only a blanket about her. shoulders, shivering with cold, and gazed at by all the rabble that came in to See her. The maids of the inn refuSed to lend her clothes, and she could find no messenger to Send to London, unleSs she would pay him before he let out; which there was no poshbility of her doing, as she had no money her-felf, neither would the people lend her any.
She was therefore under the necessity of staying at the inn in her distressed condition, till she had an anfwer to a letter she had written by the post to London. When we went into the kitchen, we pretended at first not to know her ; but she was as quick in recolledling me now, as she formerly had been upon another occaSion; she told the people in the inn, that the gentleman

just arrived, knew whom she was, and de-fired I might be called to give an attestation of her capacity of paying any money she should borrow ; nay, she was So weak as to imagine, that I would lend her Ibmie mySelf; but, upon the landlord’s deSiring me to tell him what I knew of her, I returned to the kitchen, and, after giving her the mortification of declaring publicly who she was, and where I had known her ; I told the landlord, that she was a woman of an infamous charafter, and adviSed him not to harbour her in his houSe; upon which he thrust her out of doors, without the least remorle at the many remonstrances and entreaties she made upon the occasion.
The issue of this adventure was, that her noble gallant was So enraged at her long stay from home, and at the loSs of her watch and trinkets, diat he diScarded her; when we were informed of her fate, we Sent her back privately the paraphernalia that had been taken from her.
As Soon as we had Settled our affairs in London, we Set out for Falmouth. As Eugenio had never heard a connedled detail of my adventures, I related them as we were travelling; and, more than once during the recital, that worthy creature shed
tears.

tears. In the middle of a very long stage, on die other fide oS Exeter, late in the evening, our chaiSe broke down, and, what perplexed us the more^ we found there was no possibility of its being mended that night, as the blackSmith of the village was gone to a country-wake at Some distance, and would not return that evening. While the people of the village were repairing our machine as well as they could, I walked on, and was struck with the beauty of a field of corn, which was cultivated according to Mr. Tull’s method. Upon enquiry, the people of the village told us, it was the glebe of Mr. JohnSon, the Redlor of the parish, who was a man of great worth.
This gentleman was standing at the par-fonage-door as we passed by, and very courteoussy invited us to walk in, and repole ourSelves. His houSe was fmall, but neat, and rendered very agreeable by the good lenSe and complacency of its master. As our conversation naturally turned upon our journey, when the clergyman learnt that I was going to Falmouth, in order to embark for Jamaica in the Packet, he told me he was a native of one of his Majesty’s Sugar-colonies; we could perceive a figh steal from him, as he gave us this information.

mation. Upon our ashing him, of which issand, he Said it was Barbadoes. It now occurred to me, this gentleman might post Sibly be a relation of my friend JohnSon, who formerly had been So Serviceable to ' me in my education, and probably might give me Some account of his lot; I therefore ashed him, whether he was acquainted with a perfon of his own name, who had formerly been educated under the care of Mr. Ballance, the Wcst-india merchant ? He told me, that he was that perfon; I immediately made mySelf known to him, and we embraced with great cordiality. He infisted upon outstaying that night; and Mrs. JohnSon (who had the carriage and deportment, which leemed to beSpeak Something above what one might expedt in a country parSon’s wife) went out to prepare Supper, and our beds.
He gave us a very comfortable repast, which was rendered the more palatable, by the most evident marks of hoSpitality in our. landlord. I had expressed a defire of knowing his story, which he promiSed to relate after Supper. Eugenio Seemed highly pleaS-ed with JohnSon’s conversation, and often remarked, that our carriage breaking down was rather a lucky, than an unfortunate ac-dden.
When

( i68	)
When the lady had withdrawn after Supper, I repeated my deSire of hearing JohnSon’s adventures, which, I conceived, must be extraordinary, as he had always been reckoned at Concord’s, heir apparent to a very large plantation in Barbadoes. I told him he need be under no restraint upon account of Eugenio’s preSence, as he was a perSon he might Safely place the lame confidence in, as in mySelf. He began as follows:
CHAP. XIII.
My father was a man possessed of an
estate of five thouSand pounds a year in the issand of Barbadoes ; my mother, whole favourite I had been from my cradle, was the only daughter of a gentleman of St. Christopher’s, and had an only brother; but my mother, unfortunately for me, died Soon after I came to Europe. As far as my leaving School, you know my story. From Concord’s I was Sent to Leyden, where Ballance, with his uSual .parSimony,
appointed me an allowance much below,
what
/
i i6g )
what an heir apparent to five thouSand pounds a year, and an only Son, might ex-pe6t; (for my father’s family conSisted but of me and my Sister) and even below what was necessary for a perSon that was to live upon the footing of a gentleman. I wrote to my father upon this Subje(st,^'and he in-creafed it; but, at the Same time. Sent mie ib reprimanding a letter, that I was a good deal alarmed. About this time I heard that my lister was married to an Irish phyfician in Barbadoes. I prolecuted my studies with vigour and assiduity, and was generally e-steemed as well by the masters and profel-Sors of the Univerfity, as well as by the noblemen and gentlemen, that were students; among the latter I was a good deal caressed, and flattered mySelf that I had formed connexions which would, in all probability, be ornamental, and possibly might be iiSe-ful in the future part of my life; when I had been at Leyden two years, I wrote to my father for his permission to make a short tour through Holland, and part of Germany; but I had the mortification to receive a very laconic denial, with an in-junXion to repair to London immediately, and commence the study of the Law; for that he (my father( intended I should get' my livelihood by that profession, I accord-

ingly obeyed his ordei*, and was entered of Gray’s-inn; at which place, to my shame be it Said, the allurements of pleashre, and the dissipation of a town-life, prevented me from ever opening a book.
A Templar’s life is too well known, to make it necessary for me to give you an account of it now ; youth, strong paffions, and the company of many agreeable men, with whom my acquaintance begun at Leyden, which was now grown and cemented into a friendship, hurried me into many excesses and extravagancies, which, though excuSable at my time of life, yet did not eScape the ear of my father, and were heightened and improved by thole
who represented them to him.---------But,
notwithstanding the expences of a gay life, I still kept within the limits of my appointments.
After I had been a twelvemonth at the Inn of Court, I received an immediate Summons to the West-indies; but was prevented by a fever and ague from obeying it So Soon, by four months, as I might otherwise have done, which was afterwards made a heavy charge against me : at length when I was perfeftly recovered, I went o-ver; but the reception I met with was far from being So warm or affedionate, as an

only Son, who had been abSent Sixteen years, had reaSon to exped from a good father; this coolnefs and reServe I attributed to an oddity in his diSpofition and temper, as I heard feveral people fpeak very highly in commendation of his heart and understanding ; the latter I could perceive he was by no means deficient in; in short, he was a - man of lenfe with a good heart; but still, as it fometimes happens to men, in other reSpeds of good understanding, liable to be groSsly impofed upon, and misted by perSons he had placed a confidence in, whole advice he v/ould follow implicitly, though, contrary to the didates of nature and rea-Ibn ; my Hibernian brother-in-law and his wife, I perceived, had got his ear, and laid Siege very cloSely to his perSon, So that it was morally impossible for me to get an explanation in private of his past behaviour.
My brother-in-law, though called Do-dor in Barbadoes, I learnt had been bred a furgeon and apothecary in Dublin, and had been obliged to sty his country, for having enlisted men, during the time of the rebellion, for the pretender, to whoSe caule he was most zealousty attached; but had apparently changed his principles, that they might coincide with my father’s, which were diametrically oppoSite to his real ones.

I His dissimulation, in this matter, was ex-

I	in which he imitated an artSust but extra-

vagant, brother of my father’s, who had Succeeded So well as to draw ten thouSand pounds from him, to Set him up as a Sugar-baker, which he, in a few months. Spent every farthing of; and was obliged to go to the East-indies as a fadlor of the company, where he was afterwards frequently Supplied with large Sums from the Same hand. Another brother of his own, and this Sugar-baker, had likewiSe cost him five thouSand pounds.
When thele adls of unheard-of liberality, to objects that abuSed them, are confi-^	■ dered, I am at a loSs to reconcile them with
his condudt towards me, his only Son, who never offended him in thought, word, or deed. Thele were models my brother-Surgeon and apothecary always had in his eye; and he Scrupled no means, however wicked and dishonourable, to compaSs his defigns upon the inheritance, which had been tranlrnitted by a long Succession of ancestors to my father ; my anxiety, at this state of affairs, encreaSed, and did not contribute, in a Small degree, to Sour my temper; I found there was no remedy but patience,

tience, and a resignation to providence. After having been there three years, I returned to Europe, and, as I had been told, alas! too foolishly believed, that my father’s estate had been fettled upon his marriage, and that he had an estate only for life, with a remainder to his issue in tail, I relblved to ■ marry as Soon as I conveniently could, to exclude, if possible, the Hibernian, and his progeny, from any hopes of the inheritance ; and, for that purpoSe, wrote to my father ; who, after his concife and indolent method, fome years after anSwered me, that I might do as I pleaSed, and that any per-Son I fixed upon, would pleaSe him.
I went, the Summer after, to Scarborough, where I got acquainted wkh an agreeable young lady, that I thought of a diSpofition and family, that would Suit me ; she was at that place under the care of a mother, who had been a widow ten years, and was accompanied by a brother of about fourteen years of age. They refided in the winter, in BishopSgate-street in the city of London, with an elderly gentleman, father of their late father, who was a Portugueze-merchant, a man of eminence and Substance, and who was invested with one of the greatest public employments of the city. When 1 came to London, to wait up-

on the lady, I thought I should have been I	devoured with civility and kindneSs from
the family. Her fortune, ,they told me,
I	was stnall; but the strongest verbal assu-
rances v'ere given me in private, that'I 1	should have a considerable place in the
I	grandfather’s will.
The harmony of the family was very great and remarkable, for the exceshve mutual attention there appeared between the grandfather and the daughter-in-law; the young gentleman was .idolized by the former. The day of marriage being appointed, the grandfather promiSed he would , make his grand-daughter a prefent of the
complete furniture of a houSe, which was only five hundred pounds, and a piece of plate of a considerable value, which he I went with me one day to a lilver-fmith to I	choofe. This civility continued till, by
i	his importunity, he had prevailed upon me
I to execute a releaSe, without examining the i accounts of my wife’s late father, who ! had been his partner in the [trade to Portu-! gal, after which his behaviour immediately
changed. Orders were now given for fur-‘ nishirig the houSe, and the piece of plate I
had choSe, had his own coat of arms engraved uoon it, and uSed in the houSe.
When
cT
( 175 )
When the news of my marriage was received in Barbadoes, every disadvantageous circumstance, relating to my wife’s fortune, &c. was improved by the Hibernian, and my want of reSpedt, in not conSulting my father, about the perSon I married in particular, was represented upon every convenient occafion, which were frequently found. By which means my father was So irritated against me, that, without giving me any previous notice, withdrevr the allowance he had hitherto made me; and, I was told, he had barred the intail of his estate, and, by his will, had left all his fotune, both real and perSonal, to my brother-in-law, except one shilling, which he had given me.
I fent for a copy of my grandfather’s will, and a copy of my father’s marriage-Settlement from the Register-office ; and found, too late, that my father had a fee-tail in the estate, which, by the operation of a recovery, was rendered a fee-fimple, consequently in his own diSpoSal.
As Soon as my Situation was known, my civil grandfather and mother-in-law Sought every occafion of breaking with me and my wife; (for she has been involved in th Same ruin with mySelf.) At last, my Spirit being no longer able to brook the indignit

ties, with which they not only treated us themSelves, but encouraged their favourite boy to offer us, we broke off all communication with them, and have never resumed it to this day.
Happy v/as I that I had taken this refb-Solution, v/hen I came to be told of their villany; for I was afterwards credibly in-Ibrmeci, that this mother-in law carried on a criminal intercourfe with her hushand’s father during his life, and still lived with him in a state of incestuous concubinage; that she had broken her hushand’s heart by her wicked courle of life; and that, in all probability, many of the hushand’s effects had been embezzled by his father, who was left foie executor. I was faither told, that the foward petulant young gentleman, that had been egged on to inSult us, was the if-Sue of their incestuous embraces; in the last instance Iwasconfirmed by his remark-"^able fondnefs for him, and, with regard to his dishonesty, I was likewiSe convinced what I heard was true, by his eagerneSs to make me execute a releaSe to him.
My father’s death Soon after happened ; and, according to his will, I had one shilling, and no more, fent me by his executor in England.
What
✓
/
( 177 )
What makes me blame, I had almost Said, abhor my Sather’s unnatural uSage of me is, that his indolence had been the oc-cafion of my lofing an estate of two thousand pounds a year in Sr. Christopher’s, which my grandfather, by tie ‘moiher fide, had macle a voluntary conveyance of to me after his death irrevocable, and had given the instrument to my father to have ' registered ; but he never took the trouble ■ of going to St. Christopher’s within the year after the execution, appointed for the registring all deeds in that issand ; and my grandfather, knowing that the deed was
o	o
null and void, married a young woman, to whom he left the estate, which, had it not been for my father’s unpardonable negledt, must have been mine.
Abandoned and neglected by my own relations, deSpifing and detesting the ways of my wife’s kindred, I was thus fet a-drift in the world. My progrels in the law was trifling; I therefore could hope to get nothing by that profeshon. I had Some friends left, who had caressed me in my prosperity,, that I trusted would ashst me
in my adverSity.-------But, alas! I knew
mankind but little; for, one day, when I assembled Some of my greatest intimates, and laid the state of my affairs before them,
I 5	' I per-.

I perceived an immediate referve in thoSe I most depended upon, and Some even treated me with contempt.
A whole year was Ipent in SruitleSs Ibl-licirations for Some place or employment; at last, one day reading in the Daily Advertiser, that the next presentation to a living with an old incumbent was to be Sold; it struck me, that the best thing I could do, would be to take Orders, and piirchaSe the presentation *, Soon after I put my idea in pradice, and,' fortunately, it was not long before the late incumbent died.
My wife is contented with her lot, and I live perfectly happy; we are blessed with two fine babes, her name-fake and mine. My days are ipent in attending to < my buSineSs in hushandry, and in the execution of my office, being honoured with a commission of the Peace. I Sincerely forgive my enemies, and pray that the Almighty may turn their hearts.
Eugenio, as well as mySelf, was exceedingly touched with this SenSible and pathetic recital of JohnSon’s. Our eyes w'ere, more than once, filled with tears, Vv^hich, to our additional Sorrov/, drew Some from that unfortunate and worthy man.

X rE R Y luckily the Packet was ready to ^ Sail, when I arrived at Falmouth, and I agreed for my passage at the uSual price of twenty-five pounds. There were two other perSons, who had likewiSe taken their passage in the Same vessel. We let out with a fair wind; my fellow-passengers vrere creoles of Nevis, who had been bred at a Grammar-School, and afterwards went to Cam.bridge ; from whence they had beest expelled for assaulting and striking their Tutor, and aftervrards putting him in a '%ucket, and Suipending him half-way down a well, during a cold winter^s night; by which he catched a violent cold and fever, and was very near his death.
They were returning to the place of their birth ; one of them Seemed to have a very good share of natural abilities ; but had Split upon the Same rock that I had done on my Second peregrination to Great Britain.
We diverted ourSelves, for the first week, by shooting at Sea-gulls, and other birds; at which our Cantabrigians were exceedingly expert, having employed the
greatest part of their time, during their re-
fidence
#
I
( i8o )
fidence at the Univerfity, in shooting in the Fens. “ Pray, gentlemen, Saids I, was “ your whole time devoted to shooting, at “ that leat of learning. So famous all over “ Europe, for the great Scholars, and fine gentlemen,it has produced?” “Yes, (an* Swered one of them ) for we had nothing “ elle to do. Our tutor was incapable of “ teaching us, though he pretended to un-“ derstand mathematics, logic, metaphy-“ lies, classics, astronomy, ethics, the law “ of natnre and nations.” He fit to break a gentleman, (continued the other, who was a thorough-bred Sportfman,) “ he is “ not fit to break a dog; how should a “ pedant, that has lived all his life amongst “ a parcel of low, ill-bred fellows of col* “ leges, with notions as contracted as his “ own, be capable of teaching gentlemen “ knowledge and good-breeding?” Thus theSe graceleSs Sons of Alma mater Cantahri-gienjts ufed, frequently to abuSe the gentleman, under whole care they had been placed, to be taught the academical parts of literature.
The master of the packet had been commander of a Small privateer in the 'last war, which had cruiSed chiefly in the Mediterranean ; by which means he had been a
good deal on shore in the Several ports of
Ita-
t
/
A
( ISI )
Italy. He had learnt to fence, to dance, and ride the great horle; upon which accomplishments he valued himSelf not a little. He was well verSed in romances, and had conceived a remarkable veneration for all Mr. RichardSon’s performances; Clarissa Harlowe was his admiration, Pamela pleaSed him much; but Sir Charles GrandiSon was, in his opinion, the perfedlion of human invention. It was the last mentioned cha-rafter that he had made the model of his condu6t, an example which he kept constantly in his eye ; the cabbin w^as littered • all over wgh different parts of thoSe pathetic and voluminous produClions; an abridgment of which, a wag, not long ago, with lome humour, published propoSals for printing in an hundred volumes in folio.
The captain, and my two fellow-passengers had frequent diSputes upon feveral paf-Sages in Joleph, Andrews, Tom Jones, Peregrine Pickle, and other ingenious works, that have graced the annals of English literature ; in which the Son of Neptune generally had the advantage, as thoSe authors had, for a long time, been his favourite and constant study; he Seemed to have but a very mean opinion of my intelledls, when I told him, that I admired Fielding’s character of parfon Adams, more than any o-
ther
»
( 182 )
ther in any Romance whatever; even more than his favourite Sir Charles GrandiSon.
When we had got into the latitude thirty-one north, there aroSe a most violent storm ; the waves ran mountains high ; the imitator of Sir Charles GrandiSon exerted liimSelf, to excite each mariner to give all the ashstance in his power towards Saving us from perdition ; the vessel made a considerable deal of water, and a Sudden gust of wind laid our main-mast by the board ; all hands were employed in cutting the rigging away, and diSentangling the ship of all incumbrances; we continued in this deSponding condition for at least a fortnight, and, in forty hours, must inevitably have gone to the bottom, had not the wind abated; but, luckily, a calm Succeeded the gale of wind, which gave us the opportunity of putting up jury masts, and getting the ship in readineSs to make the best of our v/ay to the issand of Madeira, where vte now reSolved to put in, in order to refit ; as it was impoffible to proceed to the West-indies, without a considerable repair; we made shift to get intoFanshall in a fortnight after our accident, and received all possible assistance from the English con-Sul, and other gentlemen of the fadtory;
by whom we were very Ifindly and hofpi-
tably
( JSJ )
tably entertained; the two academical gentlemen went to a neighbouring issand upon a party of shooting, whilst the ship: was repairing, which place was remarkable for its fine partridges, and other game; for which expedition they were exceedingly well equipped, having each his pointer, that he brought from England with him.
I diverted mySelf with viewing the local CLirioSities of the extraordinary issand of Madeira, which is a large mountain placed in the Sea; the alcent begins from the very shore, and continues, without any Sensible interruption, to the very Summit of the
hill
I uSed very frequently to go in the town of Fanshall, to buy artificial flowers of the
^	J
Nuns, which they made with great ingenuity and dexterity ; every time I went to that place, I perceived a beautiful young woman fitting by the fide of the iron bars, by which they are prevented from getting out of the Convent, in a penfive and melancholy Situation her figure struck me the first tim.e I was there •, and obSerVing her continually in the Same place, and with, the Same gloomy aSpedt upon her countenance; one evening, when she was there alone, I I endeavoured to make mySelf understood
to her in Italian, but without fucceSs; for
3S
( i84 )
as the reader already knows, what I learnt oS that language during my rour through Italy with the earl of Sparkle, was by no means Sufficent to enable me to hold a conversation ; I next accosted her in English, but to as little effedt as I had done in Italian ; I at last Spoke to her in French, which she talked very fluently, and with a remarkable good accent.
She Seemed overjoyed to find a perSon, to whorh she could unboSom herSelf without fear or reScrve : She told me, she discovered in my features a proneneSs to compassion and Sympathy, which she had rarely noticed in others ; and thanked heaven for having thrown a peribn in her way, to whom she could communicate her misfortunes, with a hope of their being alleviated.
She began her story by telling me, that “ she was the only daughter of a gentleman of the best family, and most confiderable “ fortune in the ifland of Madeira. My “ father (she continued) was fond of me “ in my infancy to excels; all his joy feem-“ ed totally to center in me; my mother “ died whilst I was young. So that my fa-“ ther was, for many years, a widower.
“ The death of one of his brothers, who “ was an officer in the PortugueSe Service at y Lishon, obliged him to repair to that

‘‘ place, in order to Settle his affair?, having “ got a large inheritance by his death. • “ When he took this voyage, he leSt me “ in Madeira, under the tuition of a French governeSs, who uSed me with the utmost “ tenderneSs, and has Since, by her anxiety “ for my welfare and advice during my “ misfortunes, been a real mother to me.
“ I was not a little SurpriSed to hear. Soon “ after my father had been at Lishon, that “ he was paying his addresses to a lady of “ that place ; the report I too Soon found “ was well founded; for I received a letter from my father, in which he told me, that he was fenfible he should appear cul-“ pable to me, and to most of his friends,
“ by the step he had taken; but that he “ had been So long tiled to a domestic life,
“ particularly in his last fickneSs, he had felt “ the want of a careful and affedUonate “ woman about his perfon, he had been “ engaged to take the step he then inform-“ ed me of; he added, that his own happi-“ neSs was to be preferred, notwithstanding “ the cenSures of the world.
“ Soon after I received this letter, my “ father returned to Madeira with his bride;
her behaviour to me at first was kind “ and civil; but was tempered with lb “ much ceremony, that I was then afraid,
“ as
/
( )
“ as I aSterwards, by fatal experience found,
“ that her kindneSs was a mark and cover “ to her wicked and artful intentions. My “ father still continued his affedlion, which “ I verily shHieve his new connexion had
^	“ by no means diminished.”
This amiable woman had got thus far in her recital, when she was interrupted by one of the Nuns, who came to tell her, that the bell was just going to ring to veSpers; So that I was obliged to postpone, hearing the Sequel of her story till three days after, when she entreated me to be prefent at the grate at the fame hour, as she had Something of the utmost importance to communicate to me; and she added, I might have It m my power to Save an innocent per-fon from eternal perdition.
I defired the appointment might be made for a Iboner day, as our ship was repaired,
i	and was to Sail in a day or two at farthest;
but she informed me it was not in her power to comply with my defire, as the two following days were annually Set apart entirely for prayer and devotion, and that
j	tlie windows were all kept cloSely shut
I	' up.
I was not only prompted by curioSity,
but by humanity and benevolence,
II	to wait in order, to hear the Sequel of the
I	Nun’s

( i8; )
Nun’s story. Upon my return to my abode in the town, I Saw the Captain of the packet, who told me that he was reSolved to Sail the evening following. I begged him to defer it two days longer ; but it was in vain to endeavour to bend this Son of Neptune •, his reSolution was unalterable. . A day or two’s longer stay will be no very extraordinary detriment to you. Captain, I Said to him; you will oblige me exceed-ingly, if you will comply with my request. “ Mr. Grant, he (anSwered) I would wil-“ Singly do any thing confistent with my ‘‘ honour and duty, to Serve you, or any other gentleman; but I am in the lervice “ of the government, and one day’s delay “ may be of conSequence to the state : Do “ you think if Sir Charles GrandiSon was “ in my place, he would prefer private friendship to his duty to his countryHe “ is the pattern I always have in my eye;
“ therefore, my dear Sir, I must Sail to-“ morrow.”
He accordingly Set Sail without any of his passengers; for I was reSolved, at all events, to wait the iffue of the Nun’s recital ; and the two gentlemen of Nevis were still upon their shooting party in the issand near Madeira.
In
( i88 )
In order the better to conceal from the gentlemen ot the Fadlory, the true reaSon of my staying, I pretended an indiSpoSition; and the deceit was favoured by the ignorance of a phySician of the ifiand, who was impofed upon by my affedled complaints. On the evening appointed I repaired to the grate of the Convent, where I found the beautiful Nun in her uSual station. After the first Salutations were over, she continued her story as follows : “ My mother-in-“ law was pregnant very Ibon after her ar-“ rival, and was in due time delivered of a daughter.
“ Having now attached my father to her “ by the strongest of all ties, namely,- the “ fruits of their embraces; she began to “ to throw off the mafk in her behaviour “ towards me, and by degrees wore off the “ kindneSs and civility with which she for-“ merly had treated me, and, after Some “ time, broke out into an open enmity. “ No stone was left unturned to injure me “ in the esteem 'of my father, and every “ opportunity was Seized with eagerneSs of “ heightening and miSrepreSenting any little “ inadvertency or indiferetion that youth is “ So apt to commit; by her repeated arti-“ fices and endeavours to estrange my fa-“ ther’s affedlion from me, she at last Suc-
“ ceeded

“ my grief and concern on this triumph “ was inexpreshble; the Sweet hours of “ unthinking youth were now tindtured “ with the gall and wormood of anxiety “ and grief; my mother’s intention was “ to Secure the inheritance to herlelf and “ offspring.
“ She still continued indefatigable, and “ called in to her aid every means, how-“ ever wicked and unjust, to compaSs her “ detestable views upon my patrimony.
“ She had learnt to forge my hand-writ-“ ing So exadtly, that it was imposhble to “ distinguish which was the real one; and “ had the baSeneSs to write a letter in my hand to one of my father’s valets, with a declaration of love, and a propoSal of “ marrying him fecretly, and going off the issand to a foreign country. She had “ gained this valet to her interest by a large Sum of money; and the letter, contain-“ ing the declaration of love, was, one night after I was gone to bed, carried to “ my father. His indignation at this offer to “ derogate from his name and blood, was “ proportionate to his pride, and veneration “ for his pedigree, which he pretended to “ derive from the race of the reigning houSe “ of Braganza.

“ My French governed, who lay over “ head, having heard the noiSe of my fa-“ ther’s breaking open my door, had got “ up, and entered my room, just as I had ‘‘ a Second time prostrated mySelf at my “ father’s feet; when she heard the crime “ 1 was charged with, she immediately de-“ dared it was all a calumny, and that, to “ her certain knowledge, I had never wrote “ a line for three weeks past, having con-“ stantly been abouf|my perSon.

“ The AbbeSs, and other Nuns, behaved “ to me with infinite kindneSs during my “ noviciate; but as Soon as I had taken “ the Satal vow, my mother’s ill offices be-“ gan to be Selt; the AbbeSs every morn-“ ing harangued me upon the fault I had “committed when I was at home; this “ was not done privately, but at table, be-“ fore all the listers, and the priest that “ confessed us; I was therefore looked up-“ on as a perSon of a prossigate charaDer “ by the fisterhood, who had been forced by my parents to retire into this religious “ aSylum. I was treated with diSrelpedt, “ not only by the nuns, but likewiSe by the “ father-contessbi*, who looked upon me as “ a certain prey; for this detestable man “ carried on a criminal intercourse with “ many of my companions; the innocent “ fruits of whoSe embraces had been mur-dered in their birth, and flung down the

I was So moved by the pathetic story of this unfortunate young lady, that I im-;	mediately promiSed to give her all the Suc-
cour in my power; and promiled to restedl; upon the best means of her efcaping from .	the Convent.
I took my leave for that evening, and ;	promised to meet her in three days, in
I	v/hich time I did not doubt but I should
be able to fall upon Some Scheme, in order to facilitate her intention of going off. I had brought only twenty guineas with me from Falmouth ; but, as I had the appearance of a gentleman, had as much credit with the merchants of the Faftory as I defired, which enabled me the more eafily to effedl the Scheme I bad concerted I went to a remote part of the istand, pretty near the Summiit of the mountain, where I hired a Small lodging in the houSe of a poor vine-yard-keeper, under the pretence of a defign of going a shooting in thole parts; 1 told the people of the houSe I should be there very late at night; but on what particular night, it was not in my power to determine; therefore took away the key to let mySelf in, when I should have occafion to go in. This matter being fettled, I bought a light fowling-piece, and having made a long

The evening after I had heard the fequel of the lady’s story, I was disturbed by a confuSed noile of people, that, by the found. Seemed to be Scuffling in the street, and, among other languages, I could distinguish the words, help and murders I instantly took my Sword, and ran into the street, where I Saw two perSons pushed very hard by fix Portuguese in long cloaks, with im-menSe Swords in their right hands, and daggers, or stilleto’s, in their left; the weaker were armed with sticks only, and were bending under the united efforts and weight of their antagonists. I drew my Sword, and ranged mySelf in the rank of the weakest fide, which I Soon found to conSist of my two countrymen, who had that evening returned from their party of shooting in the issand Situated near Madeira. I'he Portuguese were very bad SwordSmen, and had unwieldy weapons. So that I eafi-

ly disarmed one, and wounded two or three others. Fortune now changed Sides, and I	the Portuguele gave ground, which the
i Cantabrigians perceiving, rushed on with
Such impetuofity, that we Soon put the enemy to flight; just as our adversaries had taken to their heels, a guard came up,,
I	which made us all priSoners, and v/e were
forthwith conduced to the Provodore’s

without being admitted to his preSence, we lent for the English conSuI, who went in to him, and obtained our im.mcdiate discharge.
O
Our tVi?'o creoles, it Seems, had offered an inSult to one of the peribns, who had attacked them, by kishng his hand to his wife, that was peeping at him, through a jealoiiSy.
-After this fray was adjusted, we went to a Portuguese concert and ball, where we were invited, and danced with male partners, the females being admitted only to look at us through a glaSs-door.
The appointed evening at length arrived, when I was to meet the unhappy fair one at the grate ; accordingly I repaired thither at the hour she had named, and laid before her the plan I had concerted, which she >
greatly approved of; that very evening, at
the

the time the clock should strike twelve, she was to be in the Convent-garden ; at about half an hour aSter eleven I Saddled' my mule, put oh the pillion, and loaded it with the rope-ladder, and a Suit of man’s clothes, which I bought the day before, to diSguiSe the Nun, as Soon as she should clear the wall. I placed mySelf in a Small street oppofite to the Convent; but unluckily at the very time the clock was striking twelve,, there pasted Several people with lanthorns, who had been at a grand Supper the merchants had given, this oliged me to change my station, and make a circuit of a street to avoid them, which detained me ten minutes ; at length I repaired to the part of the wall I had de-fcribed to the fair one, and, having stung , over one end of the ladder ,the other beino: fastened to the ground with strong wooden pins, I railed mySelf to the top of the wall, by means of a rope with a hook at the end of it, which eaSily was fixed to the top of the wall: Up I went, and discovered the amiable creature near the wall on the other fide ; I was as alert as possible, and having fastened the pins in the garden of the Convent, made the young Nun go up before me; as Soon as we had got Safe on the o-ther fide, we mounted the mule, leaving

( 200 )
the ladder fixed, and took the road towards the lodging I had hired near the top of the hill; when we had got about a league from the town, we dismounted, and the female traveller cloathed herlelf in man’s attire; after which we stung her own a-mongst Some stags that grew by the fide of a rivulet. She told me, she had almost fainted away, when she found that I did not appear upon the striking of the clock. We arrived at the lodging I had taken before day-break, where I kept the Nun concealed for two days, without letting the people of the houSe know I had brought her along with me.
The modesty of that virtuous young woman was lb great, that she never would undreSs herSelf whilst she was in my lodging, till I absolutely inSisted upon her taking my bed ; whilst I made the best lodging I could for mySelf in the room adjoining with my great-coat, and Ibme blankets I borrowed from the vineyard-keeper. The delicacy of her lentiments, and the e-legance of her conversation Soon convinced me, that her recital was wholly founded upon matter of fadt.
The greatest difficulty now remaining, was a method of getting her off the istand undiscovered. I Sent a peaSant to town with
a let-
%
( 201 )
a letter to my merchant in London, de firing he would order one oS his outward-bound ships to touch at Madeira, to take me up; which letter I enclofed to the English ConSul, deSiring it might be Sorward-ed by way of Lishon, or Cadiz. When the peaSant returned, he told us, that the Inquisitors were making very diligent Search after a Nun, that had efcaped from the Convent in Fanshall, and the perSon that had been accessory and affisting to her e-lopement. I now thought it was time for us to change our abode, and propofed to hire a boat to carry me to the issand, from which my two countrymen had lately returned. I accordingly went a-croSs the mountain to the Sea-fide, and hired a bark, which was to be ready in three days after :■ I went back to the unfortunate nun, who waited for my arrival with a good deal of impatience ; and the evening following we propofed to remove our quarters, and, to that purpoSe, had washed our linnen, packed up our baggage, and prepared our-felves for the fatigue of the journey.
In the morning, when we were eating our breakfast, which confisted of goats-milk and brown bread, I perceived my companion, when she came from the window, in order to fit down,, turn pale;
K5	and,.
( 202 )
and, before I had time to afk her the reaSon of it, she told me that we were both devoted to the flames; for she had Seen the officers of the inquiSition below: The room we were in, was up one pair of stairs, and the door had very good fastenings to it; I therefore immediately fecured it, and loaded my fowling-piece with Several Slugs and large shot; and determined to defend my-felf as Charles the Xllth of Sweden had done at Bendar; nay, I reSolved to die with my mufket in my hand. Sooner than Surrender mySelf, or give up the unfortunate lady, who had put herSelf under my protedfion, to be made the Sport of the most cruel institution, that it has ever been in the power of human wickedneSs to invent.
I
The officers of the inquifition Soon came to the door ; but finding it locked, began to endeavour to break it open, they had brought a guard of ten Soldiers with them, and had assembled at least twenty of the country people, who are obliged to obey their orders, on pain of the Severest punishment; when I found the stair-cafe was filled, and the landing-place just oppoSite the door, I put two additional balls into my mufket, which I levelled through the door
as near the midst of them as I could gueSs;
the
¥
( 203 )
the mussel ot my piece was cloSe to the door. So that all the shots went through, and wounded many of my adverSaries, the rest ran down into the court below; I charged my piece a Second time with a great quantity of ssugs, and let fly amongst thole who had fled into the yard, which likewile did confiderable execution; they now began to fire at me, which I returned as fast as I could load my piece; they again ventured up stairs, and fired feveral times through the door at me, but none of their shots took place; for, expedling they would do So, I always placed my Self out of the way, and I had helped the unfortunate lady to get up the chimney. This engagement continued three hours; for I never fired unlels there was a perSon at the door, or, when I could take aim at one of them in the yard.
At length my fire abated for want of ammunitioB, my v/hole stock being expended ; which my antagonists perceiving, ventured up to my door in a body, and f **ed Several voUies through it; finding I did not return their attack, they cut my door to pieces with hatchets, rushed in, and Seized me; they were ail astonished to find only me, as the peaSant I had Sent the letter by, (who had returned to give them
infor-
\
( 204 )
inSormation of my lurking-place, for th« fake of a reward that was offered) had told them, the Nun was certainly with me. I was instantly loaded with heavy irons, and, being chained upon the back of a mule, proceeded towards the town of Fanshall; I was hardly gone a league upon the way, but I was overtaken by a body of people, who came shouting along, which I Soon perceived, proceeded from their joy, at having at last found the unfortunate young lady. My cale was distreSsful; but I Suffered more for the cruel lot of that unhappy young woman, who was now inevitably destined to end her calamitous life by the most cruel torments. She fainted away le-veral times on the- journey; but her mer-cileSs conduftors never once gave them-ielves the least trouble to recover her from , her Swoon. We were put into the Same room when we got to Fanshall, and a vessel w'as immediately prepared to condudl us to Lishon, where we were to be tried by the court of inquifition, and to Suffer at an auto da fe., which was to be Soon exhibited in that city. The first night we were together in the priSon: “ Unfortunate wretch, (Said she) “ as I am, not contented with “ having drawn upon luySelf the vengeance
“ of tke most cruel tribunal in the world,
' ...... ............ ‘‘but
>
( 205 )
“ but I have involved in the Same ruin the
/
“ most generous, but unlucky, of men ;* if “ there is a just and equitable judge above, “ and that there is, all nature tells me; “ I trust that, before his throne, we shall “ receive the Sentence we deServe. A Soul, “ like yours, is of a nature too refined to “ mix with thole of the common herd of “ mankind ; death therefore should Seem “ a defirable objedt to you, as it will place “ you amongst beings of a Ipecies as “ noble and elevated as yourSelf. As for “ my part, the only wish I have now to “ make is, that we may have a Speedy “ deliverance of our worldly Sufferings. ”
In dilcourles of this Ibrt she paS-fed the greatest part of the night; but, towards morning, her tender frame was entirely overcome, and she dropt into a placid steep, which lasted till she was disturbed by one of the infernal instruments of barbarous Superstition, who came in to condiKst us to the vessel that was ready to Sail. We were put into the hold of the ship, and had a quick passage to Lishon, by favour of a westerly wind, which by chance lasted for two or three days. As Soon as we arrived, we were removed to a dungeon, which can be likened to nothing with] morej exadfneSs, than a deep
dry-
\
*
/
( 206 }
dry-well covered at top. We were loaded with heavier irons, and chained to the ground; and found two fellow-Sufferers in this diSmal abode; one of them was a per-fon, wsho was SuSpeDed of being a Jew, for having Swept the dust inwards, instead of out of his houSe; the other was a poor lunatic, who had kept a woman, and had. declared the Virgin Mary had appeared to him at night, and told him there was no fin in it, which he never would recant. We had no convenience whatever, and the dungeon never was cleaned ; So that we Suffered more from the stench of the place, than from our chains or confinement. Our victuals were flung promiScuoussy amongst ns, wdiich v/e were obliged to pick up from the filth and nastinefs at the bottom of the prison.
Vvshilst we were in this abode, the lunatic died, and his body remained amongst us Some time before it was moved ; which occasioned So violent a stench, that it was with pain we were able to breathe the air.
I It was at length, however, carried away by j one of the ministers of cruelty, who, being I	struck wdth the figure of the unfortunate
1	young lady, had the unheard-of wicked-
neSs and barbarity, to gratify his brutal de-; fires, by force and violence, and in our

preSence. The bad efiedts of which she Soon perceived, by the tumours and ulcei's with which he infedled her.
Life now became loathibme to me, and I ardently wished for the hour that was to put an end to my miSery. We were conduced before the tribunal of the inquiSition one by one : Having been So accustOTied to live in the dark,my eyes were dazzled when I was brought into the court; immediately that the question was put to me, I accuSed mySelf of having assisted the unhappy fair, one in her eScape from the Convent in the town of Fanshall in Madeira ; the day following was appointed for our marching in procession to the flames, to which we were devoted ; we were all clothed in white garments, painted with the flames going upwards, which was an indubitable mark, that we were destined to end our lives by fire. The Jew went first, next followed the beautiful and unfortunate young lady, with a Smile upon her countenance: “Now (Said she, when her irons were struck off) “ I am going to a place, where I am Sure “ I shall be out of the reach of tyranny “ and oppression ; at last my calamities are “ to end, and I fliall Soon enjoy that re-“ compcnce, wdiich the Almighty always has in store for the innocent and oppreS-

“ Sed, As to you, (Said she, addressing herSelf to me) ‘‘ most generous of men, I “ die in the full expeftation of meeting you “ in the blessed manSions of eternity ; and “ happy are we both, that the time now is “ come; let us fall down upon our knees, “ and give thanks for this last favour of our Creator to us upon earth, in calling “ us from this wicked and unjust world.” She immediately flung herSelf upon her knees, and I followed her example; having passed a few minutes in this posture, we were interrupted by our executioners, who put us in mind, that it vras time for us to be marching towards the place of execution. I walked between two Fryars, who were continually exhorting me to die with Christian patience and ressgnation, and in amity with all the world. They particularly endeavoured to extort from me an acknowledgment of the justice of my len-tence, and frequently put a little crucifix to i	my mouth to kiSs, vrhich one of them car-

joy and mirth. I was afterwards told, that the night before the execution, they had ' danced round the fatal pile, upon which we were destined to finish our pains, with the most frantic exultation and delight.
The Jew was conSumed long before I reached the fire; but v/hen I came up.
Oh! reader, if thou hast not a heart harder than flint, or adamant itSelf, thou wilt shed a Sympathetic tear for the cruel death of the unhappy Nun; I faw her beauteous face, the colour of which once would have rivalled the lilly and the role, fcorched by the flames, which made her an objedl too horrible to be defcribed; her shrieks pierced the hearts of the very butchers, that had led her to the fcaffold; there was not a dry eye to be feen among the numerous Spectators, that were beholding this terrible execution; Ib unaccountable is the human mind, that its very pains are a pleaSure to it; being overcome by the flames, her cries grew fainter, and at length entirely ceafed, and her whole frame was Soon after reduced to ashes.
It was next my turn to undergo the Same unhappy fate. Near the place where I stood, I observed a' large body of men, whom; from their drefs and complexion, it was no difficult matter to tell, were Eng-lifli Sailors.	, Ii
I
( 210 )
It came into my mind more than once, if I could but penetrate the file of muS-queteers that guarded us, there was a poS-Sibility of my making my eScape amongst that brave and eenerous Set of men. I had, however, deferred it too long, the fire was now preparing for me, and the executioner was pulling off my upper garment, when the Sailors pressed in So cloSely upon the guard, that they broke the rank, which naturally occafioned Some confuSion. This I thought was a critical moment; 1 therefore gave a Sudden Spring, and mixed with the Sailors: “ Save a poor countryman, “ my boys (Said I) wshom theSe blood-^ “ hounds are going to butcher.” They all immediately gave a shout, and pushed me into the midst of them: “ Ay, my “ boy, we’H stand by you, by G - - d ; ” upon which they gave another shout, and cleared a way instantly with their cudgels through the populace. One of them stript off his jacket, hat, and wig, and put it upon me. They still continued advancing towards the VVharf, with an intention of putting me on ship-board ; but when we came near that place, we perceived it occupied by a strong guard, v/hich the officer, attending the execution, had ordered there, to prevent my eScaping
that
.	( 2II y
«
that way. “ Well, my boy, (Said one ox them) “ never fear, v/e’Il Save you yet ; “ or we’ll all perish with you. What!
Shall it be Said that an Englishman was “ burnt by the inquiSition, when a gang, ‘‘ of stout English tars were in hearing ? “ No, no, my lad, that shall never be “neither. No; Jack Spaniard and For--“ tugey is not So cunning, but an honest “ tar knows how to deal with him too.”
Vfe went to a part of the town where the Seamen chiefiy dwelt, and got into a. Small houSe, from whence I pasted over the roofs of Several others to a little Sort of a hay-loft, to which I was diredted by one of my generous countrymen. They propoSed. taking me away in the night, and carrying me on board an English man of war that was lying at anchor. But they little knew the precaution of the inquifition; for guards were immediately placed upon the landing-place, and no perSon Suffered to go off from the shore, who was not examined by the keeper of the prifon, in which. I had been confined; all the avenues in the Suburb where I was, were filled with Soldiers, and a diligent Search was made in most of the houfes; I lay still in the hayloft, where I had victuals brought me by one of the honest Sailors, by the Same way
I had
(212 )
I had gone there. In Some time the guard in the streets was more remiSs, but still as stridt as ever upon the wharf.
I thought there v/as a possibility of my eScaping in the drefs of a Capuchin fry-ar, which I was well qualified to perfonate, as my beard, during my confinement, had grown to a confiderable length. A religious habit of this order was therefore brought me by piecemeal; and, being equipped in my difguile, Vi/ith a few piastres, which the bounty of my generous countrymen bad furnished me with, in the i	clofe of the evening I ventured out. I
took the road towards the frontiers of Spain, as it was impossible for me to embark for Great Britain in any of the Por-i	tugueze ports, where my perfon was very
exadtly and particularly deferibed. I tra-i	veiled two leagues that night, and repofed
mylelf for three hours in a stnall hut at the ^	end of a vineyard, in which a man was
hired to lay, in order to guard the grapes; but he choSe rather to repair to a warmer lodging.
In the morning, having Satisfied the call ;	of nature by a plentiful meal upon grapes
and Ibme dried bread I had brought in my wallet, I walked fifteen miles without halting ; as the Portugueze [are a very Superstitious

stitious people, they have a relpedt SorFryars oS any order, bordering upon adoration.
I therefore found it no difficult matter to be Supplied with provisions ; the women and children, in Some of the villages thro’ which I pasted, fell down upon their knees, and kiffed the hem of my garment. I continued my journey with great assiduity; and, having passed undiscovered the guard upon the frontiers of Portugal, T arrived at the port of Cadiz in the kingdom of Spain.
There was a battalion of an Irish regiment, in the Spanish Service, quartered in this city, with many of the Soldiers of which, I engratiated myfelf, by astliming the style and title of an Hibernian ; the Irish are as national as the Scots, and prefer, to all others, people of their own country ; which, if it may be called a fault, is certainly the least exceptionable of any human nature is liable to; for my own part, I confeSs, I lee little difference between that and a virtue, which by the an-tients was esteemed the most glorious of any; what I mean, is patiotiSm, the name of which is only now remaining. For what is love of our country, but a love to our countrymen ? It can never be conceived to be a mere attachment to the local, or

ordinary love to our countrymen, and that love, under the name oS patriotism, is allowed to be a virtue; Surely the national partiality of the Scots and Irish, which borders upon patriotism, is So far from being 'blameable, that it is praife-worthy; and, instead of being made a crime, or exception, to people of thofe countries, is to be valued and prailed. The perSon that has the least of it in his frame and composition, fs the mere Englishman.

pies they had been educated in. Many perSons, of my name, had engaged in the Same wrong and deSperate cauSe, and particularly one oS my couSins, in whoSe com^ pany the Scots Soldier I allude to, had ferv-ed. He was a good deal bantered by his comrades for his obstinacy; a strong instance of which they gave in the following story:
When he first came to Spain from Scotland, he happened to be at dinner one day where Some aSparagus was Served up, which he had never Seen before; being the greatest stranger in the company, he was the first helped to them ; but his pride was Ib great, that he would not confeSs he had never leen any before, and ask the manner of eating them ; but he began by biting them at the wrong end ; at which thoSe who were preSent burst out a laughing, and ral-ly’d him a good deal upon his ignorance of eatables. The ScotSman denied, that his manner of eating them proceeded from ignorance; but affirmed, it was through choice that he eat the hard end ; and that his ignorance might never be ridiculed for the future, had the infuperable obstinacy of eating aSparagus ever after in the Same manner.
When

When I told this Soldier, that I was of the family of the Grants in Argylshire, he .	' conceived a very great friendship for me,
,	and made me an offer of his purSe, which,
it may be eafily imagined, was not too plentifully stored.
Orders, it Seems, had been Sent from the Inquifition at I^ishon to that at Cadiz, to stop me, in caSe I should attempt to embark for Great Britain at that port; a description of my perSon was likewiSe published, and a very great reward offered for apprehending me; in the drels that I was, it was therefore imposhble to agree with any English Captain for my passage, as the bufineSs a Capuchin fryar had in England, would appear rather extraordinary, and I was afraid to diScover mylelf, even to an Englishman, ©r the Scots Soldier, as he might be tempted, by the confider-able shm offered, to diScover me to the officers of the inquifition.
There was a vessel Soon to go from Cadiz to the coasts of Guinea upom the staving trade, and, as Soon as the cargo was complete, to proceed to Buyenos Aires; this I learnt from one of the mariners that had given me Some marks of his liberality. It occurred to me, there was a possibility of getting to Jamaica by way of
Buyenos
( 217 }
Buyenos Aires, it was in truth a little round about; but still a long voyage was a more defirable thing, than a lodging in a dungeon of the Inquifition. With an intention of being appointed chaplain to the vessel, I applied to my friend the ScotSman, who, being upon a good footing with his fer-jeant, and his ferjeant being a favourite of the lecond lieutenant’s, I was by him recommended to the Surgeon of the vessel, who was a Frenchman: The French Surgeon introduced me to the Captain, who was named John Thomas Nunez Navarro: He told me, they had little occafion for a chaplain on board a staving ship; but if I choie to officiate in that capacity for my commons, and take the chance of the be-nefadlions of the officers and mariners, I was very much at liberty to embark with them. I immediately accepted of the proposal, and very Ibon after, we let Sail from Cadiz for the western coasts of Africa. Our vessel was called the Nostra Signora Beneditta di Compostello; she was freight^ ed with pen knives, glals baubles, rattles, and fugar-plumbs; one would have thought we had been going to a country peopled only with children.

becauSe the Europeans have conquered A-merica, they make staves ot the people of Africa ; but as otherwile Sugar would be dear, and as the Negroes are black, and '	have flat noles, and prefer a glals-necklace
to things of greater value, it is proper they should be kept in a state oS Servitude. A Colonel, who had read the above-mentioned passage in the Ipirit of laws, very Sagaciousty remarked, that MonteSquiou’s reasoning was puerile; upon which I could not forbear telling him the observation of an Irish Bishop to Swift, when he ashed his opinion of Gulliver’s Travels; why. Said the reverend father in God, I cannot comprehend the reafon that people should make fo great a work about that book ; for my part, I think it is a heap of impro-i	bable lies. John Thomas Nunez Navarro
i . had not quite fo much statelineSs as the generality of his countrymen; his natural phlegm was tempered by the gay and volatile difpofition of MonSieur De la Font^ the French Surgeon ; who, though he had been driven out of his own country by the tyranny and oppression of the state, yet still preServed the highest opinion of arbitrary government; he would leriousty ash me, whether I thought the liberty, that prevail-I ' cd in the British dominions^ which he

Upon my telling him, that the English were of a contrary way of thinking; he leemed greatly Surprised, and shrugged up his shoulders with an air of pity and contempt. If any thing extraordinary was mentioned, either in nature or art, he always affirmed very roundly, he had Seen Ibmething still more worthy of admiration in France.
The conversation one day happened to turn upon the populouSneSs of the different cities in Europe; John Thomas Nunez Navarro allowed, that London was larger, or more extenfive than Madrid; but thougrht the latter contained at least an equal num* ber of inhabitants; being ashed, how many fouls London was generally reckoned to contain upon a medium computation ?
I told them, between eight hundred thou- ■ Sand and a million ; but rather nearer the latter, when the Parliament, and courts of Justice were fitting ; and pray Monfieur De la Font, Said Navarro, how many people of all ages and Sexes may there be in Paris ? A million or two. Said he; nothing could be more vague, or like a Frenchman; had he Said, twenty millions, the falssiQod would have been glaring, and ap-

What is “ art capable of producing comparable to “ the Tuilleries or Palace RoyalThe gal-“ lery of Luxembourg Surpasses any thing “ in Italy; and the Scene is assuredly the “ finest river in Europe.

“ found out, had he not made a tour to “ Paris and VerSailles; but-do you think “ he is worthy to wipe the dirt, even off “ of I’Abbe de Nollet’s shoes ? He is not “ to be named in the fame breath with “ DeScartes; if Plutarch was to write the “ the lives of thofe two men, namely,
‘‘ Newton and Monfieur de Nollet, he ' “ would undoubtedly give the preference to “ the latter. Monfieur de Nollet is far “ Newton’s Superior, as a mathematician “ and a natural philoSopher; and to Say any more of Newton, is what no English-“ man ever pr^ended to do; on the other “ hand, the great de Nollet is a Poet; he “ wrote a copy of verSes in praiSe of Ma-“ dame de Pompadour, which was much “ esteemed, and the whole court Said ma-“ ny handSome things in commendation “ of his poetical talents ; Monfieur de “ Nollet is likewile a man of pleaSure and “ gallantry ; he knows how to Say a thou-“ Sand Soft things to the ladies, and, in “ his younger days, was celebrated for be-“ ing a man of intrigue. Now, turn your “ eyes upon Newton; I never heard at “ Paris that he ever made a distich in his “ v>ihole life; what Signifies his colours and “ gravitation, if the MuSes frown upon “ him ; and the poor, bashful creature did

I “ am confidently told, he never once
“ tranSgreffed the most rigid laws of cha-“ stity, though he lived to a very great “ age ? Monlieur de Nollet then was as great a p.hiioSopher ; and, in that parti-“ cular, at least Newton’s equal. Mon-fieur de Nollet is a very pretty poet, “Newton never wrote a verSe, de Nollet “ had a genteel addreSs, and danced a mi~ “ nuet in the greatest perfedlion ; Newton “ did not know how to make a bow, or ‘‘ come into a room ; therefore, upon the “ whole, the French philolbpher, though “ with reSpedt to thoSe of his own nation, “is to be regarded in a Subordinate, lecon-“ clary capacity; is far Superior to the English philosopher, or] that ofany othe “ people in Europe.”
Captain John Thomas Nunez Navarro, being nettled at the inSolence and Self-Sufficiency of the Frenchman, after having taken, with a good deal of deliberation, the pinch of rappee-Snuff he had between his fingers, began as follows : “ My dear “ Friend, Don de la Font, I am Sorry to “ find, that you have let your vanity So far “ get the better of your^ underftanding, as “ to assert So many falSities, inconSistences, “ and contradidions as you have been

“ guilty of.” The Frenchman began to stare at the word vanity ; and when John Thomas Nunez Navarro came to fdfities., he put on his hat: “ Your great philoSopher, (continued Navarro) “ who you Say is not “ to be named in the Same breath with “ Newton, was only a msad-man at liberty; “ his head was filled with vortexes and “ whirlpools, which existed no-where but in his own crazed imagination ; he had “ vivacity and SprightlineSs, which you, “ Frenchmen, esteem above the more So-“ lid and durable qualifications; his rea-“ Sonings were hypothetical, and his con-“ clufions ill drawn, and generally Salle, “ even Suppofing his premisses had been “ Sound; but when you preSume sto com-“ pare your little raree-show-man to Don “ Cavaliero Newton, my pity for your “ ignorance is changed into contempt.” The Frenchman had been whistling part of an air in one of Lully^s Opera’s, during the |latter part of Navarro’s Speech ; but, as Soon as he uttered the word contempt,, he jumped up. Seized one of the cabbin-stools, with which he stood in a threatening posture ; Navarro got up from his Seat without any hurry, and walking to stis bureau, unlocked it, and took out a pistol; the contrast between the vivacity of tsteFrench-

man, and the Spaniard’s coolnejfs, was very striking; 1 immediately placed mySelf between the enraged De la Font and the phlegmatic Spaniard, and, by Some entreaty, prevailed upon the former to go up upon deck; but Navarro still kept his pistol in his hand; which, upon the approach of dinner, he put back into the place from whence he had taken it.

There is a story very well known, of a Spaniard’s playing a game at Chefs, which had been first begun by his great grandfather, who had left it to his Son to continue ; but neither the lives of either the Son, or grandSon, were long enough to end it. There is likewife an account, either in Gil Bias, or Don Quixote, I do not recol-ledt which, and I am too lazy just at this time to turn over thoSe novels to come to a certainty; there is an account, I Say, of a Spaniard’s being interrupted in the middle of a story, and called away by Some bufi-neSs, staying Seven years in Mexico, returning to Spain, and happening to fall into the Same company where the thread of

Sir ISaac Newton. Tlie Spaniard, after he had eat a hearty breakfast upon onions, bacalajo, and dried bread, continued as follows:
“ All Europe has acknowledged that hu-man nature is more obliged to Don Cava-“ liero Newton, than to allthe philoSophers that lived before him ; but as- to yoirr Nollet, I never heard of his being other, “ than a Superficul ledlurer upon experi-“ mental philofopny ; and his principal ex-, “ cellence consssts in shewing the experi-“ ments, which Don Cavaliero Newton was ‘‘ the first that made. I never heard that “ dancing, or making bows, was any ne-“ cessary part of a philoSoper’s charafter or that writing fonnets, or love-verles, “ enabletl a man to calculate with tlae “ greater exadlneSs; thoSe are qualities that ‘‘ may engage the attention of a French-“ man ; but people, who are intent upon “ things of a more Serious nature, take my word for it, my friend Don de la Font, “ they lodk above Such trifles. If the great “ Don Cavaliero Newton had any com-

( 227 )
^ petitor, it was Leibnitz the German, who “ has disputed with him the honour of in-“ venting fluxions, or wshat you call the “ injiniment Petits i but even allowing the “ glory of that invention to the German “ philosopher; yet Newton’s glory, in the “ discovery of the Several primitive consti-“ tuent colours that form a ray of light, “ by means of the prifm, will remain un-“ Sullied to the latest posterity. The care “ and ingenuity of his experiments, the “ candour and Icrupulous regard to truth, “ with which he relates them, are very re-“ markable, and at the Same time that we “ admire the Sagacity of the philolbpher, “ we cannot but esteem and love the man. “ His continency. So far from being a reproach to him, is an honour, and will “ be looked upon as Such by all mankind, “ except thoSe libertines, who have thrown “ off, even the appearance of decency.
“ And as to your famous river Scene, “ that you boast So much of, there is Icarce-“ ly water enough for our long-boat to go “ up it as far as your renowned city of Pa-“ ris ; which, we must allow, is a large “ city ; but not comparable to London in “ extent, convenience, or oppulence; but “ you make me pity you exceedingly, when

Some parts oS the gardens, I am told, are “ fine ; but then you now and then come “ to a dog-hole, which riiakes one hate and “ deSpile the whole.
“ You astonish me, when you put your muSic upon an equality with that of the “ Italians. A very ingenious, though whim-“ steal author, who once wrote a pam-“ phlet upon the French muSic, begins “ thus: There was once a report in “ Germany, that a child was born with a I	“ golden tooth, all the literati exhausted

The reader may poshbly be Surpriled at lb general a knowledge, in a man of Navarro’s station in life; he was originally intended by his parents for a priest, and had been very well educated in a JeSuit’s college ; but when he came to years of discretion, had objedted to their choice, and taken to a Sea-faring life.
De la Font Scarcely knew how.to relish this Ipeech, better than he had done the former ; but as he was assured, that Captain John Thomas Nunez Navarro was armeei against his assaults, he thought it better to overlook the contempt,|with v/hich he treated his nation, than to reSent it at prelent. His choler, however, quickly Sub-lided, and he was Soon after as much Navarro’s friend as ever he had been in his life.
The Captain and Surgeon had frequent bickerings, relating to the Superiority of the French nation over every other in the world; in which I always jdned the former, when an occafion offered, in which there was no danger of my real principles being discovered; for I was under a neceS-Sity of ufing as much caution on board this vessel, as if I had been on shore, either in Spain or Portugal. The terror of the in-quiSition is So great, that a Spaniard or Portuguese
#
C 232 )
tugueSe trembles at the very name of it; if therefore any of the crew had had a Sulpicion of my being a Protestant under the habit of a Fryar, they would have been obliged, under the Severest penalty, to Secure me in irons during the voyage, and give me up to the inquiSition upon their return home. I was forced very frequently, in order to carry on the deceit the better, to coincide with both John Thomas Nunez Navarro, and De la Font, in their notions relating to political matters, in which they both agreed.
The English constitution, and all republican constitutions, were stigmatized by thele friends to arbitrary government, with the epithets of abSurd, licentious, and dero^ gatory from the Sovereign and divine power of kings, who, they both infisted, should be regarded by mankind, and treated as ' beings approaching the Godhead. They both affirmed, that the power of a free, or republican state, never could last, or even arrive to any degree of eminence, in a civilized and enlightened age. When I ' hinted to them, that a Republic had conquered the world, and at a time when the arts and Sciences were in their greatest per-fedfion ; they still infisted, that her whole-glory was owing to the didatorship, which,
for
■ •
I
/
( 233 )
for the time it lasted, was the most despotic of all commands ; and the Romans were So Senfible of the advantages of arbitrary power, that, v/henever the SenSe of honour and glory uSed to stag amongst the people, or when the Republic was in any imminent danger, they always fixed upon shme man of Superior merit and bravery, whom they invested with an unlimited dictatorial power; though it would have been eaSy to have taken off the argument, and proved to a demonstration, that delegation of the Supreme power to be conSistent with liberty; yet I thought it more adviSeable and expedient, in my preSent circumstances, to acquielce irx vshat thoSe two very deep politicians advanced relating to civil Institutions.
Whilst we amuSed ourSelves with Ipecu-lations of this Sort, we made the coast of Guinea; where, after many fruitleSs endeavours to traffic with the natives of the country, and having lost above half our crew by fickneSs, we were obliged to ule stratagem, in order to compaSs our intentions : We had two men on board, who understood the languages of thoSe nations, and could Speak it with a good deal of fluency ; one of which was dilpatched up the country, to a very fierce and warlike nation, with the
mate,
#
^	r
( 234 )
mate, and two others oS the ship’s crew ; the other, accompanied by De la Font and mySelf, were ordered to to vifit a numerous people that bordered upon the Sormer. In our way up the river, we were Sollowed by crocodiles, and in our first night’s encampment upon the shore, were attacked by three tygers, which we Slew.
I will give the courteous reader three times to gueSs the motive of our em-bashes to theSe two African powers, and! will lay odds he will not Sail upon the right one; it was to propagate the religion of J,e-Sus Christ, perhaps ; No, Madam, you are wrong ? It was, very likely, to procure pro-vifions, of which you possibly might be in
i	great want ? No, nor for that purpoSe nei-
ther ; that is the Second gueSs. Very possibly you might carry with you Some of your glaSs baubles and Sugar-plumbs to traffic with the Negroes You are out in that guefs likewise: If you are then determined to know our reaSon for going, it was with the humane, benevolent, charitable Christian defign ot fomenting, exciting, and railing a a diSpute between thoSe two nations, and endeavouring to caufe a war between them, that we might purchaSe, at a cheap rate, , the captives that they should make in battle.

When we arrived at the abode of the Sovereign of the people where we were going, we Saw this mighty prince (who was a much greater man than either of the Cherokces) fitting upon a wooden bench under a callibash-tree. He had just dined, and a herald proclaimed aloud three times, “ That now all the people of the earth “ were at liberty to go to dinner.” Wc prostrated ourlelves before him, and, when he turned round, we kissed (not his face, as we do that of an English lady; nor his hand, as' we do that of an European king; nor his toe, as we do that of his holinefs the pope at Rome) but his heel, which he lifted iip to us, for that purpofe, with a great deal of state and dignity. We pre-stnted his majesty with a glafs fmelling-bottle, a pair of ear-rings, and a pen-knife, value four-pence three-farthings sterling, upon the nearest calculation I could make.
The African was fo well pleafed with our generous and valuable donations, that he offered us Several of his daughters in marriage ; from which honour I exculed my-Self by the vow of celibacy I was Sup-poSed to have made ; but our interpreter, and De la Font, were each married to three of the princesses of the blood that evening.
We
I
( 236 )
We now tried every art in our power, and uSed every method our realbn could Suggest, to cauSe a rupture between the two neighbouring states, in which we were received with So great holpitality and curte-Sy; we were all honoured with Seats at the king’s table, and had a guard to attend us whenever we thought proper to make ex-curtions into the woods, or dangerous places. Finding that our emissaries at the court of the neighbouring state had not hi» therto Succeeded So well as to engage them to commit any a61;s of hostility ; and that we could not perSuade our Ibvereign, by all the rhetoric we were masters of, to break the treaty he had entered into with his neighbours ; one evening, when their Tartarian brides were fast asseep, De la Font, and the interpreter stole from their beds, repaired with Ipeed to a large field of plantains and bananas, belonging to the Subjeds of thejadjoining state ; in which they committed the most terrible devastation, by cutting down the plants with their cutlasses, and treading them under their feet; when they had done as much miSchief as they possibly could in So short a Space oS time, they returned to their conSorts unSuSpeded. The waste they had committed, was Sufficient to alarm their neighbours, who prepared
o
( m )
#
pared to revenge the injury they had received, by open war.
Our ship-mates, as it is eaSy to conceive, took advantage of this inSult, to Spirit on the Africans, amongst whom they had been received and entertained with the utmost kindneSs and civility. They Set many engines to work, to add to their reSent-ment, which was already railed but to too high a pitch : There was a formal declaration of war on both Sides, and each nation made the greatest preparations for distressing its enemy, to the utmost of its power.

with all forts of African rarities. And the prince bad conceived So great an affedlion for us, that he reSolved to accompany us down the river to the ship, with his fix daughters, that were married to the Interpreter, and MonSieur de la Font; we thanked him for his kind and affedlionate intentions ; and entreated him to Spare us the anxiety of parting with So dear and generous friends, which would add to our grief, by putting them to the inconvenience of a long and diSagreeable journey back, through a barren and inhoSpitable country ; which, it would not have been in our power to have passed, unleSs we had come in our boats.
As this African prince was a very polite and well-bred fort of a monarch, the more we endeavoured to prevent his waiting upon us to the ship, the more eager and de-firous he Seemed of going ; accordingly he followed us with many rich and valuable preSents, which he brought to lay at John Thomas Nunez Navarro’s feet, whom he was told was, and regarded as an Embassador extraordinary, and little inferior > to the king of Spain; when we all arrived upon the lea-coast, MonSieur de la Font went on board, to apprile Navarro of the honour that was intended him by the Sovereign

I	Sent, to endeavour to excite it to war. The
ship was decorated in the best manner the Spaniard was able; his streamers were waving in the wind, and the warlike founds of drums and trumpets, contributed to raiSe in the prince a Sort of love and reverence for the Sacred charafter of our fidtitious Embassador extraordinary.
The Oaves we had purchaSed, were first embarked, who were three hundred in number, and had been purchaSed at a very mo-derate rate. The Subjects of our friend,
I	that been Sold us by his adverSary, were
I	first Sent on board, and focnred in the hold
oS the ship, to prevent their being Seen, or i	discovered by their antient master, which
would have been a diSagreeable, if not a 1	dangerous circumstance. An elegant re-
I	past was prepared for the entertainment of
I	the prince, and fix princesses, to which
'	they all stated themSelves with great maje-
sty, and Seemed not in the least to dissike the Spanish cookery. Every time his majesty drank to Navarro, a whole round of the ship’s artillery was fired. Whilst the destrt was strved up, which confisted of dried European fruits; as I was placed next the cabbin-window, I could fee the water much plainer than any of the other

perSons at table, I was' astonished when I looked at the Sea, to find that the ship was under way; “ What can be the meaning of this. Said I, Don John Thomas Nunez “ Navarro ? I protest I think the ship is Sail-ing,”“ Be Silent (interruptedNavarro) un-. “ der pain of the Severest punishment; I “ would not have his Majesty’s appetite for “ the raiSons and dried figs Spoiled, upon “ any confideration; but he is a stout, ro-“ bust, well-made fellow, and will do ex-cellent lervice to his Catholic majesty,
“ the king of Spain, and the Indies, in the “ filver-mines.” When the African prince, and his fix daughters, had Satiated them-Selves with European fruits, and got half- ' Seas over with Sweet wines, they expressed an inclination of returning to the shore, and walked up upon deck. The prince did . not immediately cast his eye towards the shore, but was told of our being under Sail by one of the princesses. He at first imagined the Captain intended to divert him with a fail, and return towards the land in the evening; but when the evening came. Heavens! What were the feelings of this unhappy, deluded mortal!

Our vessel was freighted with three hundred and fifty staves, which were bought, as I have before oblerved, upon very moderate terms. Our voyage to Buyenos Aires was very short, and we had a quick Sale for our cargo.
The African prince fell to the lot of a Spanish shopkeeper, and his fix daughters were Sold to the governor’s lady. Signora Donna Clementina Guanna., dUbara., y Figue-era.^ y Mafearenes, y LampourdoSy y Souza^ who was lately arrived at Buyenos Aires from Spain. The	yJFernando dH-

trick of continually stroking them with hi§ fore-finger and thumb ; particularly when he was conversing with any peribn about buSineSs, and whilst he Was hearkening to what was Said to him ; it was remarkable, that. Since his marriage, he had left off the contemptuous Sneer with which he uSed to treat every body about him; his wife, Signora Donna Clementina Guanna, d.Hara., y Figueora^ y Mafcerenes., y Lampourdos., y Souza.f had been contraded, and married without her knowledge, or conSent; her mother was an Irish lady, very nearly related to Mr Wall, minister in the foreign Department to the king of Spain ; it was. her father that had made the match, and shipped her off to Buyenos Aires, contary to her inclination; for which reafon she detested the very name of a Spaniard, and was as partial to all peribns born in the British dominions, as her antipathy was fettled to the natives of Spain; looking upon the former as half her countrymen: Her figure was extremely engaging; she was a brown woman, with all the advantages peculiar to perSons of that colour, together with every thing that is admirable, in fair people; her large black eyes were naturally exceedingly lively; but fince her arrival at Buyenos Aires, she had contradled.

All her actions, every word she Spoke, were accompanied by an engaging air, which it is more eaSy to imagine, than expreSs. She had no occafion, in order to pleaSe thoSe she conversed with, for that affected petulance, •which is always diSplayed at the expence of reafon, good lenie, and propriety ; neither did she life high*flown metaphors, or forced expressions; her conversation was lively, without being the least Satyrical; she was prudent, even to dissimulation, she expressed herlelf with east and propriety; but never uSed to talk of herstlf, or her own accomplishments. Though she could Ipeak French, English, and Italian, equally well, she could play any thing upon the harpfi-

She played likewife upon the mufical glasses So well, that it Surpassed delcription, and the power of imagination; she was indeed the first inventor of that instrument ; Shuman, and all the other performers upon it, are as much inferior to her, as a blind fidler that plays in the streets, is below Giardini or Pinto; and I really believe,, if a man was upon the rack, and she was to play to him, that he would ceafe to feel any pain during the continuance of the mufic.
She danced to perfedlion; Sung like a Syren; drew incomparably well, and had a very pretty genius for poetry. With So agreeable a perSon, and So many accomplishments, she was, perhaps, one of the most amiable perSons, not only at Buyenos Aires, but in all South America; and I might add North America too, and Europe, Alia, and Africa.
Our cargo was Sold upon very advantageous terms ; the Captain, John Thomas Nunez Navarro, and De la Font, cleared at least five hundred per cent, by which means they became people of considerable property. De la Font, not relishing the life of a Sea-faring man, hired a shop in the tpwn of Buyenos Aires, and Set up as phy-

in curing a dilbrder very common on the I other fide of the line, called Hernia’s.
'	. People of all ages. Sexes, and denomina-
tions reSorted to his shop for relief in this alarming and mortifying dilbrder. A-mongst others there repaired there a tall, raw-:boned, red-haired man, named Don Gordinos, whom they treated with the utmost relpedl. I thought the first time I heard him Ipeak, that he had the accent neither of a native of old Spain, or of any of the Spanish West-indies; one evening, when he came into De la Font’s shop, a-bout the time it was duSk, in order to try :	on a new-invented steel-truSs, which the
French Surgeon had exhausted his whole I invention in contriving; not So much with
the view of the immediate profit, that would ariSe to him by curing Don Gordi-nos’s hernia, which had been deemed incurable by all she most eminent Surgeons, not only of Buyenos Aires and Paraguay, but likewise of Mexico, Chili, and Peru, to whom his cafe had been transmitted; but to get himSelf recommended to the fa-

There w'as one thing very remarkable about this man, which was, whenever he went through a door, either in going out of a room, or coming into one, he uSed always to walk fide-ways; I y^iften ashed De la Font the reaSon of this Singularity ; but he never could, or would explain it to me.
Gordinos obServing me very often in De la Font’s shop, and perceiving there Sub-fisted a very great intimacy between us, notwithstanding a difference In our opinions relating to political and constitutional matters, defired that we might be made acquainted. De la Font, being a perfon who piqued himfelf greatly upon his breeding, told Gordinos, that if he would do him the honour to eat Soup with him the day following, he would take care that father Grant should be of the party. Upon his pronouncing the word Grant, Gordinos jumped back, at least five yards: “ What! (Said he) is it possible that I

The facetious dean of St. Patrick’s has left us a motto for the JeSuits, very well adapted to that intriguing, and buSy order of men.

According to his promife, DomGordinos ' came to De la Font’s the day Sollowing. There was a very Sumptuous entertainment prepared for this foreigner, who was treated by all the inhabitants of Buyenos Aires with the utmost deference and reSpedS, as he was Said, by general report, to have the governor’s ear, and, it was Suppoled, was very well paid by that nobleman for the intelligence he uSed to give him, about o-tlier people’s affairs. The governour, it Seems, when a man grew rich,' or throve in his circumstances, uSed, upon Some pretence of public emergency, either for the reparation of the fortifications, or the levying of troops, to borrow a confiderable Sum of money of him ; and, as alecurity, would give him his note for it, payable in fix weeks, with interest at the rate off twelve per cent, per annum. But it was remarkable, he never had made any payment; either of the interest or principal, and people generally imagined, never intended it; by which just and equitable means he had raiSed a very large fortune; and as all .the courts of judicature were filled with perSons devoted to his interest, and staves to his passions and humour, there was no poshbility of obtaining redrels by any legal method; But the greatest hardship
M 5	was,
\
«
( 250 )
was, the abSolute neceshty there was of complying with his request, whenever he made one ; for if the perSon he applied to, should give him a denial, his ruin was inevitable ; for, as I have before Said, the judges being all his creatures, they would condemn him upon the {lightest accuSation, unsupported by evidence, the least circumstantial proof, and Sometimes even without a preSumption or probability; for, ac* cording to their method of proceeding, it lay in the breast of the judge, whether he "Would hear the defendant’s evidence, or not; and in the casts I allude to, it was very rare that the party who was thus profecuted, was allowed the opportunity of making a defence.
Don Gordinos, as I have before hinted, was looked upon as one of the governor’s emissaries, that uSed to give him information of the peribns who had acquired fortune. This circumstance, I take it for granted, was unknown to my friend De h Font, otherwistit is difficult to conceive, that he would have been So fond of entertaining this gentleman at his houst, for fear of the bad constquences that would unavoidably follow So great an intimacy; but, however. Such is the vanity of the French nation, that it is stsh a matter of
doubt
p

C 251 )
doubt with me, whether the honour oS entertaining Don Fernando dLhara., y Figueo-ra.f y Mafearenes, y Lampourdos^ y Souza, a whifker-dresser, would not lull his prudence and discretion, and make him Sor-get the riSk and danger of So hazardous an intercourle.
Navarro, the captain of the guinea-man, was likewife of the party, as well as Several other gentlemen of the town of Buyenos Aires. After a plentiful repast the bottle circulated very brilkly, which naturally put Navarro, as well as De la Font, off of his guard; the vanity of the latter prompted him to boast a good deal about the riches he had acquired by his Skill and addreSs in betraying the African prince; Navarra ikewife had the imprudence to diScoverthe extraordinary profits of his adventure. The Frenchman Said, that, as loon as he had doubled his capital at Buyenos Aires, he would tranSmit his effects to Bayonne, near which place, in the province of Bearne, he would purchase a Signiory, and live like a gentleman, as he was entitled by his birth, being Sprung from a family that had Sixteen quarterings of nobility, and having two couSm-germans, counts in the Convent at Lyons. I could perceive Don Gordinos to listen to thefe accounts of wealth with
extra-
t
< 252 )
extraordinary attention ; and, by the que^ stions he threw in, Seemed to deSire they would dwell upon that SubjedS; in order to do which, their vanity and fpirits, raiSed by the generous god, wanted no Ipur or provocative.
As they were both very great politicians, •the conversation at length turned upon government. I knew the Sentiments of thefe two gentlemen, relating to this Sub-jedt long ago, and I now hoped, that as I was reinSoiced by a native of Great-Brh i tain, I should be able to maintain the argu-
rnent, with Ibme degree of equality, against i thele sticklers for arbitrary power and de-;j	ipotistn.
li	De la Font first opened:, and talked
;;	much of the advantages of a truly mo-
il narchical power over every other institu-I .tion ; the promptitude of the executive I power; the union it prelerved in a state; I and the felicity the people enjoyed, who had

constitution, properly policed, is the best calculated to render mankind happy. Vfhy, anSwered Gordinos, assiiming an air of importance, as if his opinion was to be final and conclufive, I plainly perceive, father Grant, for which I am Sin-'	cerely and heartily Sorry, that you still
prelerve a tindture of thoSe barbarous and ferocious notions you was educated in;
I	but that is your misfortune, and not your
;	fault, as it likewiSe was mJne ; but I have
'	long fince, thank heaven, deracinated thoSe
abSurd principles, which are fb inconfistent with reaSon, justice and religion, and pro-dudcive of So many enormities in the places where they are encouraged, and fostered with care,and indulgence. - It is Surpri-fing, that all the republican countries, v/hich must be lenfible of the Sweets of art bitrary power, by the happinels of thole nations which are fubjedl to it, do not change their constitutions for one that is So much better. I am astonished at this infatuation I which I can explain no otherwise than by the Spirit of fadtion, party ' and opposition, that has been, for So many

s
( ^55 )
generations, handed down, and cherished in thole anarchial governments.
Though I could by no means agree with Dost Gordinos in his political notions, yet I was under a necessity oS giving a nod oS approbation for my own Safety; as this gentleman’s diSorder obliged him very frequently to viSit De la Font’s shop,
I had frequent occafions of converfing with him, and by that means contradfed an intimacy. As by his being fettled at So great a distance from his own country, I imagined there must be fomething very lingular in his adventures, I often entreated him to indulge me with a recital of them, in which he promised to gratify me the first time that circumstances would furnish him with an opportunity; therefore one day, after dinner was over at De la Font’s, as there were preSent no other strangers but Gordinos and mySelf, after making an apology, to the Frenchman for Speaking in a language be did not understand, he begun as follows :
“ My real name is Patrick Gordon ; I am the younger Son of a clergyman in Aberdeenshire, of a very good family; for I am distantly related to the duke and the carls of my own name: By my mother’s fide
I am likewise nobly deScended ; for she

Benefices in Scotland, you know, in general, are Small, and his was of the Scantiest Sort; for it was little more than forty pounds a. year. He had eight children ; fix daughters beSides my brother and mylelf; he educated all his children himfelf, and discharged that part of his duty with great care and exadlncSs. When I was Seventeen years of age, he laid out ten guineas in stocking a farm for me; for I was intended to be a farmer, and get my livelihood by hushandry and agriculture ; but being of a rambling turn, I liked better to go abroad, and fee the world, than to be fixed to the ipot where I was born. I therefore converted my implements of husbandry, horfes, and other stock, into ready money, without my father’s knowledge, which having invested in goods, I took .up the employment of a pedlar. My courfe was diredled fouthw'ards, and I passed the Tweed in company with two other of my countrymen that followed the Same way of life. The profits of my
buSineSs were Sufficient to keep me comfortably,
( 257 )
fortably, but I generally lived upon the public ; for whenever I could conveniently knockdown a fowl, or kill a lamb, (which was eassly done with the utmost SecreSy) I never was at the trouble or expence of buying vidluals. One day, however, when I had killed a young wether, I was dif-' covered by the Servants of a justice of the peace, to whom it belonged. I was immediately handcuffed, and carried before him, for which he forthwith comrhitted me, as it was his own property ; for had it belonged to any one elle, a fmall gratuity, properly given to his clerk, (which his worship would have come in for his share of) would have mitigated the rigour and Severity of the law; but in this cafe an example was necessary, to deter others from invading his property, which he choSe to have regarded by all the neighbourhood as Sacred and inviolable.
“ After I had been in prifon four months,
I was enlarged, upon condition that I would inlist in a marching regiment quartered in that county. It was the beginning -of the Spanijh war, and there was a great occasson for able-bodied men, both in the fea and land Service. The; life of a Soldier was what I had always been educated in , the averSion and detestation offor which
reafon.

When the propoSal was made me, I rejedted it; and, in order to prevail upon me, the certainty of ending my life in an ignominious manner, in cafe I did not'comply, was rep relented to me. Upon resseclion, however, and the uSual inlisting money of eight guineas being given me, I took the oaths of allegiance and Supremacy to his Britannic majesty. People are SurpriSe:d on their first Seeing me, at the mariner of my coming into or going out of a room, which my preSent rank in life, would make it improper to me to explain to every body; but as I have told you I have been a- pedlar, your own realbn will naturally Suggest to you, that it is a habit con-tra(sted when I carried a pack.
“ I got married, as Soon as I was in the army, to a trull, who Soon convinced me I was not the first that had been favoured with her .affedlions. I was Sent to the hospital, where the matrimonial venom I was infedted with, was carried off by the Saliva. As Soon as we were both recovered, we again cohabited, and in the Space of three years and a half had four children: My thievish inclination to pilfer, still continuing with me in the army, I was

ReSolved, however, one day or other, to be revenged, in the year 1745 our regiment was ordered from Flanders into Scotland, where it was preSent at the adtion of Falkirk; at the beginning of which affair,, as my tyrant of an adjutant was very buSy and alert before the line, when we were ordered to advance and fire, in the confufion I took aim at him at the distance of two yards and blew his brains out. Before the battle was over, I left my rank, and deferred to the rebels, who received me with great joy. My wife and children were left to shift for themSelves. We marched into the* heart of England, as every one knows; and though but a deSpicable handful of half naked men, put the city of London in So great a consternation, that the memory of it will not be very eafily obliterated. After the fate of our army was determined, I followed the fortune of the young chevalier, whom I accompanied during his wandering thro* the western ifies. We were hid together in the fame oven in the isse of Sky, when the crew of the infernal bomb was in-Search of us; and I went with him over

I was kicked out of the houSe, but not profecuted ; as he was afraid I should give ^ information to the government of the intercourse he maintained with its enemies; for although his letters were generally written in cypher, yet I had fallen upon one, which let me into the bufinefs, in v/hich he was very deeply engaged.
“ I again applied to the old gentlewoman, who recommended me to a member of the Irish houfe of commons. My only employment was that of dressing my master’s wig, and Setting up at night to let him into his lodgings. He dressed very richly, and had a large wardrobe of fine cloaths, which I very often wore when I had an inclination to pafs for a gentleman,
I frequently walked in Phoenix Park, in the habit of a man of fashion ; unluckily, however, one evening as I was fitting in the front boxes at the playhoufe, dressed in one- of my master’s gayest fuits, playing , with my fnuff-box, looking at the ladies through my pockeVglaSs, and giving my-

lelf all the airs of a travelled coxcomb, my master came in, and placed himSelf by my fide. He did not recolledl my features immediately, but in the middle of an aft, when a dead Silence reigned in the houSe, he was convinced the deaths were his own, and worn by his own footman ; at which his choler being railed, he interrupted the play by collaring and striking me ; as I had not perceived him when he came in, I was thunderstruck, and making the best of my way out of the houfe, was followed by him along the passage, where he kicked and bruiSed me most unmercifully ; I got, however, out of the houSe before him, and thinking it imprudent to return home, went immediately to a pawnbroker’s shop, where I raiSed five guineas upon the Sword I had on. A learch it was natural to conceive would be made for me, I therefore left Dublin that evening, and direfted my courle towards Corke, where I relblved to enter into the company of strolling players, that were exhibiting in that town. My appearance was indeed rasher fingular for a pedestrian itinerant; and the entertainment of a hedge alehoufe, ill Suited a gentleman dressed in a pompadour Suit, richly embroidered wish gold, wish laced ruffles.

“ I was admitted a member of the company ; the Scotch, you know, have never made a figure upon the stage ; their natural awkwardncis, and diSagreeable harsh pronunciation, dilqualifies them Sor that employment. My a(5tion was likewiSe exceedingly dissiked, and I have been told, it relembled very milch the motion of the vanes of a windmill. We lived in the company in a perfect state of nature; Some of the adtors vrere married indeed to the adtresses ; but the vow they had taken at the altar, was no tie upon theSe Sons of pleaSure and libertiniSm; we might, with great propriety in this particular, be likened to a herd of cattle, or a stock of sheep. I was again married, not to a female comedian, but to the maid of an ale-houSe in Cork; who struck me with her beauty, and I eSpouSed her, for the Same reaSon Sir John Brute married his wife; she became a member of our Society, but was prevented from long exhibiting by the marks she bore of Soon bringing into the world a young comedian.

As I thought it more than probable he did not recollcCt me, I continued to go on with my part; but at the end oS the third aCt a constable laid hold on me, and the audience was obliged to postpone the Sarther hearing and Seeing the representation. The gentleman Swore a robbery against me, and I was committed to jail to take my trial at the next assizes; but my pregnant wife came one day to See me in priSon, and changing dresses with me, I by that means made my eScape, and left my conSort to get off as she could. I embarked for England with a party of itinerants, who were going to that kingdom upon a party of hay-making ; and as I had no particular views, reSolved to follow the Same buSineSs. What with hay-making and harvest-work, -I Scraped together a pretty round Sum ; and in the winter, got a confiderable deal more by Supplying the places of chairmen and hackney coachmen, when Sicknefs or pleastire called any of thoSe gendemen away from their employments ; to which occupation I was recommended by my fellow passengers from Corke, and brother hay-makers.

ciety of Irish fortune-hunters; my abode in Ireland having furnished me with a Sufficient title to affume the character of an Irishman. The rules by which the Society was governed were, First, That every member should contribute five guineas annually towards the Support of the Institution; Secondly, Not to be eqnipped for adventures till he had been a member two years; Thirdly, That he should pay a fourth-part of his wife’s fortune, in cafe he should Succeed, to the public stock. There were other regulations, with regard to the number of days in a month, an adventurer was to be allowed his chariot, &c. But the time I have mentioned were the fundamental laws upon which our Society was established.
As Soon as my time of inadlivity was expired, I qustted Service, and, being properly furnished, went down to Tunbridge, where, after a courtship of fix weeks, I carried off a gentlewoman pretty well stricken in years, who had been kept by a nobleman till his death; and was by him left twelve thoLiSand pounds in ready money, jewels, plate, and furniture. She required no Settlement; I therefore got entire poS-lession of her whole fortune. I took a genteel houSe, and fet up a gay equipage;. we

viSited all public places, where we generally dreffed richly, and kept the best company, to which I was the more eafily introduced, as I played very deeply,and wasextremely Sond of gaming, a vice which levels all ranks of men, and lets the footman upon an e-quality with the peer of the realm,. By this means I got admittance into Some of the most fashonable houSes in town, and had the liberty of talking to a ducheSs with the utmost familiarity; a liberty I generally uSed to pay dearly for to her hushand at Pharoah, or Laniquinet. The rate that we lived at Soon exhausted our twelve thousand pounds, and I got confiderably in debt, without a poshbility of ever paying my creditors, unleSs Some unforeSeen accident was to furnish me with the money.
It has been remarked, that people who play, begin by being dupes, and end by becoming rogues; which remark was verified in me : For having lorn a large Sum of money at play, 1 reSolved to repair my fortune the Same way 1 had ruined it. Pharoah had been my favourite game ; I therefore thought it most adviSable to continue to play at it, as an alteration of my game might create Suspicion; I made it my bu-, fineSs to find out a card-maker, of whom I beshoke an hundred packs of cards; but

They were accordingly Sent to me; and having marked the edges oS Some particular cards with a black-lead pencil, in Such a manner that I could not mistake them ; I lent back the cards, which were made up, and had the stamp-duty fixed upon them. Every body knows, that, at all gaming coffee-houSes, at the Mount, at White’s, Sanders’s, and the King’s-arms in Cornhill, the tables are Set in the room in the morning, each with two packs of cards upon it before any any body goes ; I ufed therefore to repair to one of thoSe places, of which I was, a member, anc'*^ put two of my marked packs upon every table in the places of thoSe I found thera; So that I was Sure, at which table Soever the Pharoah-bank should be held, that I should have my marked cards to play with; I won a good Sum of money by this means; but, unluckily, one morning, when a four fellow held the bank, and I had Swept off more than any body at the table, he took it into his head to re-
N 2	move
( 268 )
move the table into a dark corner of the room. So that I could not distinguish the marks I had made ; my luck immediately changed ; upon which a shlpicion was naturally raiSed of there being Ibme trick or artifice pradtiSed by me. The company therefore examined the cards at the window, and discovered the marks of the black-lead pencil, -which were very viSible. I j,was 'kicked by leveral gentlemen I had cheated, and expelled the table in the most ignominious manner.
The story Soon got wind, and became a public town-talk ; So that all the fashionable houSes, which before had been open to me, were now shut, and admittance denied me.
When I had Spent all my winnings, and •Sold my furniture, I retired with my wife to a Small lodging, in a court going from the Mews to St. Martin’s church-yard; from whence I frequently made excurfions to Finchley-common, or Hounfiow-heath,
. to Supply my expences. It was not in my power to forgo the pleafure of a game at cards; as I had been expelled the politer Societies, I therefore got admittance into one of not So reputable a fort; there was an ale-houSe in an alley, the back of New-port-market, wwere hackney-coachmen,

butchers, and hostlers tiled to repair, in order to paSs away a dull evening *, I won at first a good deal in this Society, by means of my marked cards. Some of which I had still in store; but as we had a clean pack only once a week, the marks were fooa worn out, by the greaSy hands of the gentlemen that played.
One evening, when I was out upon a pecuniary expedition on Bag-shot heath, I went up to a fingle gentleman, in order to lay him under contribution, who, at the fame instant that I preSented my pistol to his breast, and bid him stop, asked me likewise for my money, and pulled out a weapon of the fame Sort; we both were e-qually astonished; but upon an explanation being made, I found that my brother-robber was a master-barber, that uSed to frequent the Same houSe that I did behind Newport-market, whom I had frequently played with at LanSquinet and putt After we had robbed two officers in a post-’ chaiSe, armed with a pair of pistols and a blunderbufs, and four ladies in a coach and fix, we rode home together. My companion told me, the master of thehoule where we uSed to meet, was concerned with him, as well as Several other of the people that were frequently engaged in the houSe. at

One morning, however, when the room was very full with different parties at putt, all-fours, and Swabbers, two tallow-chandlers came into the room, and called for a quart of porter; they fat in a box, and took no notice of any perSon for a confide-rable time; at last, one of them riSing from his feat, ran towards me, and. Seizing me by the collar. Swore I was the man that had tobbed him upon Finchley-common. All my comrades, instead of coming to my ashstance, left their cards, and run out of the room, as did the master of it: Conscience makes cowards of us all; it would have been the eaSiest thing in nature, if my companions had stood by me, to have mastered the two fellows that assaulted me. I had a pistol about me; but my hands were immediately lecured, and there was no possibility of my ufing it. I was carried before a Westminster Justice ; to whom I confessed the robbery I was accufed of, and Signed my confeffion. The two perSons that took me, it Seems, were captains of merchant-ships, whom the master-barber and mySelf had robbed upon Finchley-common ; I found that they Swore So pofi-tively to my features, there was no posh-

I wrote to Several of the noble peribnages who had formerly cheated me of great pare of my wife’s fortune, during the gay period of my life; as to her, she had Some time before gone into the Service of a lady in Yorkshire.
Don Gordinos had got thus far in the recital of his adventures, when we were interrupted, by a messenger from Don Per--fiando dLbara, y Figueoray y Mafearenes, y Lampourdos, y Souza., the governor, to De la Font, whom he defired instantly to fee, having Something to impart to him, in which the glory of his Catholic majesty, the king of Spain and the Indies, was nearly interested, as well as the Safety of the whole state. De la Font was a good deal confounded at this Summons; which, however, he prepared to obey, and defired that Gordinos, and my Self, ^would do him the favour of bearing him company to the go-vernor’s houSe; which request we both very willingly complied with.

T^^H E N we arrived at the governor's ^ % palace, we were condudled into a large hall, where, being left by Gordinos, we continued for three hours, without any word Sent us Srom the apartment within; at length, however, the folding-door was opened, and the echoing it made in the Spacious hall, cauSed no Small perturbation in the heart of my friend. We were ushered into the governor’s preSence by an English laquey, who bowed down to the ground every step he took; and, as we imagined it was the etiquette of the place, we followed his example.

Thomas, for his prosperous and happy voyage to Cadiz. As we were deScending the steps of the palace, we met Navarro, who had like wile been Sent for by Don Fernando dLbara^ y Figueora., y Mafcarenes.^ y Lampourdos., yr Souza.t upon Some emergency of the state ; as we walked back to De la Font’s shop, he did not utter a word all the way; but after we had Sat down for a few minutes, and had stared at one another Sufficiently; what Say you now, my friend.

The promptitude of the executive power is admirable j it is furprifing all free states do not Submit to the will of one man. My dear friend.

I mean no offence, De la Font, I anSwered ; So far Srom exulting at your reverSe of fortune, that I Sincerely condole with you upon it. My intention was only to make you lenfible of the abSurdity of your political notions, and the tyranny and oppress-fion of that System, which you and Navarro uSed to extol with Such hyperbolical encomiums. You should, however, I continued, endeavour to bear this accident with patience and refignation ; a Submishon to the divine will, in matters where human prudence and industry can avail you nothing, is not only incumbent upon us as a duty, but like wife the only alleviation we can hope for under Such circumstances.
Whilst I was administring this Spiritual conlblation to my French friend, Navarro came in, who bore marks of rage and choler in his countenance, rather than me-lancholly and dejedlion : Ah, my reverend father. Said he, addressing himSelf to ' me, you are but too right in your idea of government; and by fatal experience, I am now too late thoroughly convinced, that one man, let him be ever So great or good,

been ten years Scraping together a Small Sum of money, that I might educate my family, and provide for the neceshties of the old age, of mySelf and my wife; and here, in half an hour, it is irrevocably Snatched from me, by the avarice and rapaciouSnefs of the governour of Buyenos Aires. Happy are thofe men, who have the fruits of their industry and honest labours, lecured to them by good and wholSome laws ; the just and due observation of which is enforced by a wife, upright, and incorruptible juriSdidtivc power. For my part, life is become a burthen to me, stripped, as I am, of all Subfistence; I have nothing now to defire, but that the Same arbitrary power, which has robbed me of my property, would likewife put a period to this unfortunate existence of mine. Let us hope for the best, my dear friends, De la Font, Said I, and Don John Thomas Nunez Navarro, the money his Excellency the governor has borrowed of you, may very possibly be paid much Sooner than you expedl; befides, you have confiderable interest with Don Gordinos, who is every thing with his Excellency, and, by that means, you may possibly be able to obtain a quick order for your reSpedlive Sums of money, with interest at the rate which has been promifed you.	,	yMy

“ My dear Friend (interrupdng me, an-fwered Navarro) “ you are a stranger to “ the manner of our Spanish governors, “ particularly to Don Fernando dLbara, y “ Figueora., y Mafcarenes.^ y Lampourdos^ y “ Souza; and as to your countryman, Don “ Gordinos, I have been Since credibly in-“ Sormed, he is the minion and instrument “ oS the injustice and oppreshon of the go-“ vernor; our intercourse with him, a-“ las ! I but too much fear, has been the “ caufe of our ruin; judge then whether “ we should alk or expedt any thing from “ that quarter ? ”
I know too much of Gordinos’s history from his own mouth, to have any doubt remaining concerning the integrity of his heart, which I should now have diScloSed to my two unhappy friends. Had I not thought it more adviSeable to be filent upcn that article, for the following rea&n ; the Fryars of the fociety of Capuchins at Bnyenos Aires had often invited me to take up my abode in their Convent; the way of life and principles of that order of men was what, in my heart, I abhorred and detested. I therefore always thanked them for their civility and good-will; but excufed mySelf by apologies. Sometimes founded in truth, but more frequently frivilous and

fidfitious; which, being sh oSten repeated^ had created a Suspicion, that there was fbmething very remarkable about me^ which I was ashamed, or rather afraid of discovering; the conSequence of which was a report to my disadvantage, which Gor-dinos very candidly and amicably told me-had reached the governor’s ear.
o
It was to no purpole my two fellow-passengers bewailed the cruelty of their lot;, the day following, according to his Excellency’s appointment, the fecretary waited upon my friends, and carried away what they valued more than drops of their hearts, blood. I could not help thinking, that the tyranny and injustice of the governor' to De la Font and Navarro was a providential punishment for their ingratitude and inhumanity to the African prince, and the fix princesses, his daughters.
Gordinos no longer viSited De la Font,,., for which reaSon we were all confirmed in, the opinion, that he was the caufe of the governor’s demanding the loan; a messenger one evening came to me in a great.
^ hurry from this gentleman, with immediate orders to repair to Don Fernando d.Vara^. y Figueora.^ y Mafcerenes., y Lampourdos., y Souza's houSe; I obeyed the Summons instantly," andwas introduced into Gordinos’s

apartment; who, after making an apology for Sending for me in fo Sudden and abrupt a manner, told me, that the governor’s lady, hearing that there was a Romish priest of the English nation at Buyenos Aires, and having a remarkable partiality towards people of that country, had defired to employ me as a fupernumerary cfiaplain, and wished the very next morning to have a probational conversation with me. Gordi-nos in fisted upon my staying to Sup with him, and the entertainment he treated me with, which was his uSual fare, convinced me, beyond a possibility of a doubt, that he shared with the governor the fortunes of thoSe unlucky people, who had acquired a tolerable property in the province.
After Supper, when the Servants had Served the deSert, and left us to ourfelves, Don Gordinos having drank a glaSs of Malaga, to my fucceSs in the agreeable employment I was going to enter upon, reSumed the recital of his adventure in the following words:
“ After I had Sollicited all my former great friends to no purpofe, to obtain a pardon for the robbery, I was confined in a dungeon; I at last thought of writing to, my wife, who, it Seems, had upon her marriage Secreted a large Sum of money, that
she

she concealed in the hole of a wall, which she cauSed to be bricked up a short time before she changed her state; she immediately came up to town, and promiSed to procure my enlargement, provided I would quit the kingdom, and never return to it more.
“ Her money had a very powerful and miraculous effedl; for one morning, as Icon as I waked, I Saw my door open, and leized the opportunity of making my ef-cape. It was inSerted in the News-paper, that I died in priSon. I went in the packet-boat to Ostend,where,having Spent two pieces my wife’s bounty had furnished me with,
I travelled to Antwerp, where I enlisted in the Walloon guards, and was Sent with a body of recruits to Barcelona, which was the head-quarters of our regiment. Finding at length that honesty is the best policy, I determined to recommend mySelf to my officers by my good qualities, and Sue- . ceeded So well, that I obtained my discharge, and was recommended by one of them to wait upon the Son of the Marquis De I’ASminas, governor of Catalonia, not merely as a laquey, but at the Same time to instrudl him in the English language, which his father was defirous he should learn. Flattery, that most powerful of all engines,
by
• «
\
28^2 )
by which the human mind is to be worked upon, was the means by which I engratiat-ed mySelf with my young master, to that degree, that I acquired a total aScendant over him; he governed his mother, who had an entire Sway over the Marquis; So that I acquired the dominion oS the whole province of Catalonia.
I accompanied the family to Madrid,, where I was recommended by the Marquis De I’ASminas to Mr. Wall, as a proper peribn to attend his relation, Signera Donna Clementina Jttanna.^ to South Amierica. I was employed in a very diSagreeable eommiS-fion, as I was near the perSon of one of the most beautiful women it is possible to conceive, who had let herlelf So much against the perSon, and part of the world she was going to, that it was enough to melt the heart of a Savage, to be a witneSs to her grief and lamentations.
It was in vain that we represented the dignity and magnificence of the employment, with which Don Fernando dLbara, y Figueora., y Mafearenes., y Lampourdos., y Souzat was invested with, the nobility of his pedigree, the gentleneSs of his mannas, and the beauty of his perSon, it was all to no purpoSe.
During
( 283 )
During the passage, which was a very long one, as we were detained by contrary winds, she never ceaSed bewailing her fate ; and, when she was brought into the governor’s preSence, she fainted away; every thing that could be imagined, was done to conSole her; his Excellency had made the greatest preparations it was pof-, Sible, to receive her with Splendour and magnificence. The day after her arrival was fixed upon for their nuptials; she de-fired it might be deferred till after dinner, which was granted by the bishop with Ibme difficulty. The fatal hour at length came, when the indissoluble knot was tied; when the ceremony was over, fixing her eyes upon his Excellency, the lovely Clementina fetched a deep Sigh ! It is true. Said she, the words are pronounced by which I am married according to the laws of my country; but I must do that justice to you, and to myfelf, to declare, I never will be yours. The governour tried every method to bend her stubborn heart. After the tables were removed, and they had ? drank coffee, he led her through the irn-ipenSe apartments of the palace, which were more remarkable for the taste of the architedture and furniture, than the magnificence of them. From the palace she
was

was condudfed into the most delightful gardens; all that art can invent, either with regard to Symetry and brilliancy, are joined in this delightful Ipot, to the charming fimplicity of nature: On one fide were rustic grotto’s and meandring rivulets, whoSe gentle murmur invited perlbns that v/ere near, to repoSe themSelves upon its verdant and moffy banks; on the other fide was a fucceffion of cafcades, which reached almost out of fight; Superb curio-lities and statues which would rival the fumiptuouSneSs of stow-gardens; in one place the new-married couple lost them-lelves in the winding and unequal walks of a wood, the wildneSs of which rendered it the more agreeable ; in another part, a-venues of a Surprifing height afforded a more eaSy, but a leSs voluptuous walk r The parterre’s enchanted the beholders with the variety and beauty of the flowers with which they were adorned. Flora had fixed her empire for ever in this Spot, and the gentle zephyrs Seemed as if they had lost their inconstancy, by the delight they Seemed to take in this place. The woods and groves were filled with all kinds of birds ; the turtle-dove mixed its tender and plaintive notes with the lively and tremulous Song of the thrush and nightingale.
Every

( 2§5 )
Every thing, in short, naturally excited the idea oS love in this delicious retreat; every objedt offered it to the eyes, and inspired the heart with it; it almost Seemed as if it was communicated to the air of this enchanting place.
Clementina, however, retained the de-jedted look she had all along borne upon her voyage from Old Spain. During the walk of the new-married couple through theSe delightful regions, Don Fernando dL-bar a., y Figueora., y Mafcarenes^ y Lampour-dos., y Souza., was continually talking to the unhappy Clementina about the ardour of his passion, and Ibmetimes Squeezing her hand with the utmost tenderneSs, would give her a hint of thoSe more than Sublunary pleasures he was going loon to feast upon; but she, all the time, appeared to be absorbed in melancholy contemplation ; and, whenever she could do it with decency and good manners, withdrew her hand. After they had beheld the most curious and Surprifing fire-works, the governor con-duded her back to their apartment in the palace, where she placed herSelf in the corner of the room at a considerable distance from the rest of the company; the gover-nour, after she had been there Some time. Seated himSelf near her, and began a tender

She uled every art in her power to prolong the repast ; which, however, at length was ended ; and she inSisted upon playing a party at ombre or quadrille, which, after a good deal of entreaty, his Excellency conSented to ; when this was finished, the governour conducted Clementina to her apartment, and, assuring her of his Speedy return, left her to her waiting women, whom he enjoined to do their office with the utmost diligence, and quickly to put Clementina in a Situation to anSwer to the impetuoSity of his deSires.

The unhappy, dejedted Clementina shuddered upon her going into her apartment, and as Soon as Fernando had left the room, . stung herfelf upon the bed, which she bathed with a profusion of tears: Unhappy wretch that I am, faid she, my duty, and the laws of my country, on the one hand, exadl an obedience to the will of Don Fernando ; but, on the other, what violence must I do to my own inclinations ? And must I fubmit to be folded in thoSe odious arms, to have thofe detestable whiSkers.... Her fighs, and the deluge of tears that stowed from her lovely eyes, prevented her . from finishing the Sentence; she Spent a constderab'e time in restedtions and observations of this fort. Her women at length, however, finished the greatest part of their employment, all the pins, by which her magnificent Suit of clothes had been put on, were stung about in the most brilliant confufion. The bride was now covered only with a light Silken garment, and her women had prepared the nuptial bed for her reception, as Soon as they should finish their bufinefs entirely, when she ordered them to withdraw, and leave her to herSelf.
They represented to her, in the most re-Ipedlful manner, the necessity of her going

to bed. She anSwered, stinging herSelf upon a Soph a that stood very nea, she would not go to bed the whole night, and shewed So inlurmountable a resolution, or rather an obstinacy in this matter, that her women, at length being tired oS waiting, leSt her. As Soon as they were gone out of the room, she run to the door, which she double-locked, bolted, and barred. The waiting-women run down stairs tittering, and defired I would inform his Excellency, Don Fernanda dLbara, y Figueora.^ y Maf-carenes.t y Lampourdos.^ y Souza, of what had happened, and the reSolution Donna Signora Clementina had taken. His Excellency having already had a Specimen of the lady’s coldneSs, reServe, and appearance of distike to him, was not So much astonished as I expedted, when I imparted to him what the waiting women had told me, relating to her reSolution, and her having Secured the door. Oh ! Said he, (stroking both his whiskers with his two hands at the Same time) I warrant you, I will contrive matters in Such a manner, that she will change her opinion relating to the necessary fundbions of her state; let the women fit up all night, and do you be ready,

Let me alone, my dear Gordinos, replied his Excellency ; and, taking two wax-lights in his hands went up a Small stair-caSe, near which was a private door, that opened into the bed -chamber, behind the tapestry, which Donna Signora Clementina had not perceived, and consequently left unSecured. Clementina still continued upon the Sopha, cooling her heels, and thought herSelf very Secure from Don Fernando dLbara., y Figueora-> y Maf~ ■carenes., y Lampourdos.^ y Souzd.s Entreaties; as Soon as she Saw him come into the room . from under the tapestry, was So extremely lurpriSed, that she twice fainted away. The governor, being a man of great forefight, brought a fmall vial of hartshorn, which he instantly applied to her noSe ; and it had the defired effedt of recovering her. He had got her left hand in his right, and when she had perfedtly come to herlelf.

Ah, dearest Clementina, vouchsafe to turn thoSe piercing and bright luminaries towards me; one look, be it only of compassion, will fet my heart at eaSe. I • am not your enemy; it is not a Savage, or a barbarian, that is Ipeaking to you, but the most tender and passionate of lovers, who, totally yours, would for ever, if he was able, blot out from the annals of time, the days he has lived without adoring you. Is it me therefore that you ought to hate, and fly from ? I do not hate you, anSwered tqe lovely Clementina, lifting up her eyes, which were Swelled with the tears she had shed ; I have as great a regard for you as for most men, which indeed amounts to no more than a perfect indifference. Love is an involuntary passion, and if it was in my power to put it on, or command it, my duty to you as my lawful hushand, and my obedience to my cruel parents, who have forced me into your arms, would be reaSons for my defiring to have it. I have then nothing more to lay, anSwered - Fernando; your interest, if nothing elSe, mcthinks, should engage you to behave

with IcSs rigour and Severity. Go then, enjoy your cruelty ; I never shall talk to you more oS my passion, and the necessary matrimonial Sundtions you have this day, in the most Sacred manner, engaged to undergo ; by your unaccountable capri-ciouSneSs the more I talk to you upon the Subjedt, the more averle you are Srom it Ah, charming Clementina, he added, I deServe better treatment Srom you; and I am convinced, if you had any lenfibility at all, you would be mollified by my entreaties ; will thoSe eyes, and that charming mouth. Said he, kishng it with ardour, for ever put a negative on my defires ? Upon his Excellency’s taking this liberty, Clementina stew to the bell in the corner of the room, which she rung with the utmost violence; upon which her maids run up stairs and she opened the door to them.
Don Fernando never has been able to prevail upon her to Submit to the Hymeneal fundlions, notwithstanding every stratagem fallen upon to effedt that end. And if you can, by any means, foften her stubborn resolution, you may expedt to be rewarded in the most ample manner. After Gordinos had drank fucceSs to me in the agreeable

office I was going to enter upon, I wished him a good evening, and took my leave for that night.
The day following, when I had waited upon the governor and bishop, I was ush-' ered by Gordinos into Clementina’s apartment, who paid a great many compliments to the Nation from which I was fprung. Notwithstanding her refraftori-jieSs, with regard to the matrimonial duties, her looks very plainly indicated, that she had not a bit of Nun’s flesh in her whole composition ; during our intercourse I frequently observed her to look at me with more attention, than I thought any religious motive could engage her to do.
She had not been been Sparing the day
before of her languishing locks, and, after
I had left her in the evenino- Sent me a

message, with an injunction to wait upon her very early in the morning. I thought there must be Some very extraordinary rea-fon for this message, as it is unuSaal for the Spanish ladies to Send messages to per-Ibns, who are not of their own Sex, however Sandtified by a religious calling. I obeyed the Summons at the hour appointed, and perceiving a remarkable stillneSs and Silence in the palace, I naturally enquired
the

the reaSon oS this extraordinary quiet ? One of the porters told me his Excellency Don Fernando dLbara^ y Figucora., y MafcareneSy y Lampcurdos., y Souza, was gone into the country, with many oSthe nobility, to hunt the wild boar, and was accompanied by the greatest part of his retinue and houS-hold. I w'ent to Ciem»entina’s apartment, who was fitting upon a Sopha; she leant her head upon one of the cushions, and was amuSing herSelf with knotting; and was dressed in one of thoSe dishabilles. So extremely careleSsly put on, that, by the accident of a pin’s giving way, or the break • ing of a loop, more is expoSed to view, than was at first intended to be concealed: A tunic half open before, discovered a neck of So admirable a form, and So tranScen-dent a whiteneSs, that, had I not been fortified with the strongest reSoIution of never more being SuSceptible of gentle feelings for any woman, but the adorable Lucinda, 1 very possibly might have lost that relpebt for Clementina, she now, I could eafily discover, ardently wished I should no longer preServe. Her legs being careleSsly ssung over one another, were rested upon a footstool, by which she contrived to distover her well-formed ankle, and the most con-

fiderable part oS one oS her legs. She almost appeared as iS she had lost all decency, and when I approached her, my Sace was covered with blushes : Come near me, my dear and reverend father. Said she, in a IbSt tone of voice, taking me by the hand. Sighing, and looking at me in the most languishing manner, come here, she Said, and be Seated, that I may hear the more di-stindlly the Sweet and mufical Sound oS your enchanting voice. It is a thouSand pities, she continued, that you hide the greatest part of Ib genteel and elegant a perfon, by the homely garments of your order. Limbs made like yours, the grace and nobility of your gate and gestures, are entirely concealed and lost by the ugly and uncouth teguments that cover them; theSe accidental or fortuitous advantages, I anSwered, Donna Signora Clementina, can Scarcely be deemed our own; whatever is the effedt of chance, in no meaSure belongs to us; therefore are little to be valued. The mental qualities, or thoSe which depend im-meeliately upon ouSelves, are the only ones that are truly meritorious; virtue, prudence, dilcretion, generoSity, benevolence, and particularly an endeavour to fulfil the duties of that state in which our own inclinations,
or
« •
I
( 295 )
or chance, has placed us ; theSe are the qualities or perfections that are really and in-trinfically valuable. Our duty, Madam, in every reSpeCt ought to be performed with the most Scrupulous exaCtneSs. In the first place, our duty towards our Creator; in the next, our duty to ourSelves; and, lastly, our duty to Society, or to thoSe with whom we live, or have connections of any Sort; Such as a just and rcaSonable obedience to parents, and, above all, a Submishon to the necessary and proper inclinations of a huff band. In this place, Clementina fixed her eyes upon the floor, and gently pulled her garment downwards: we are in general by nature, 1 continued, formed for the marriage state ; and when we have once taken the vow of obedience to a hushand, that, as well as the intentions of that condi-tion, as a political institution, and the pur-poSes of fulfilling the first general hail, should be forcible and cogent arguments to prevail upon every woman to Submit to the wishes of her hushand.
My dear and reverend father, anSwered Clementina, I can plainly See the Scope and tendency of your difcourSe ; my unconquerable antipathy to the man I have been compelled to marry, is a misfortune which time, place, argument, nor any thing in na-

I am formed by nature like other women ; but, alas! she continued. Sighing with defire stashing from her eyes, I am but too SenSible that I am made like other women, and would willingly Submit to the wishes....... but taste, you are very Sen-
sible, as well in women as in your Sex, is totally involuntary; and we are no more ahle to diredt the choice, upon vshich our love is fixed, than we can alter our taste for a pine-apple, or a ne£l:arine, into an averfion for thoSe fruits, or into a liking or fondnels for wormwood or rhubarb. Believe me, we are not mistresses of our own defires; and if Don Fernando was as amiable as a perSon that you very well know :
She, in this place, feiled my hand, and, fc|ueezing it, looked at me with confufion ; then, lifting up her eyes, let them fall upon me with the utmost tenderneSs, and Sighing with violence, continued ; too happy should I be to yield him what he has wished for with Such impatient defire. Clementina had now gone So far, that she thought there was no possibility of retreating; she therefore determined not to mince the matter, having hold of my hand, and still

continuing to preSs it; many, I have the vanity to think, have been penetrated with the graces and charms of my peribn, and was I Sure the man upon whom my arderrt wishes are placed, was not inSenfible to my pashonate defires, he should find, that I would reward........in this place, pul-
ling me gently down upon the Sopha, she kissed my cheek.
The great perturbation my whole foul, and every petty artery in my frame, was, at that instant, stung into, is inconceivable; my complexion is naturally Sanguine -, Clementina’s perSon, always incomparably beautiful, received new lustre from the confufion her excefs of passion occafioned; her Snowy, heaving boSom, her eager looks, her gentle Squeezes, and broken fighs, were circumstances that concurred in no Small degree, to stagger my resolution of unalterable fidelity to the lovely and much injured Lucinda. But the image of that divine creature coming strongly into my mind at that critical moment, I jumped up from the fopha, and v\?ent out of Clementina’s apartment with the greatest haste.
My ruin, I took it for granted, would Ipee-dily be estedled, if I did not% the country ; for which reafon I immediately waited

upon the Captain oS a Frigate, that was to Sail the day following for Ferol in Spain, who gave me the liberty of going in his vessel.
Late in the evening Clementina’s favourite waiting-woman and confidante brought me a purle of an hundred pistoles; in •which I found a paper containing the fol-• lowing words:.
“ You are defircd for ever to forget the “ most unfortunate of women, who loved “ you. with an ardour and delicacy of “ paffion your obdurate and inSenSible Soul *• was uncapable of perceiving, and conle-“ quently of making a Suitable and adequate “ return, and to sty this province with the “ utmost Speed. And let me repeat it to you “ again, and for the last time, eternally “ bury in oblivion, that ever you knew the “ unhappy
“Clementina.”

The wind continuing fair, we failed the next morning, according to the Captain’s intention, and, in a few days, reached the line. The morning after we had got thus far, the man at the mast-head gave us notice, that a Sail was bearing down, and Ibemed to gain upon us every moment.

We Soon discovered her to be a ship of
force; at length she came up with us, and, hoisting English colours, fired a gun. We ^ made a shew of fighting ; but, after we had fired our broad-fidc, struck. The principal officers were all removed on board ^ the English man of war, and I had the lot of being Sent for amongst them. There was upon the deck an officer of marines, whofe features I thought I had Somewhere Seen before, but could not that moment recoiled: the perSon’s name. I therefore aSked the centinel that guarded us, the names of the officers of the marines ; who informed me, that the Captain was named Jacobs. I had now no doubt remaining, but that the perSon, whoSe features had struck me, was my old School-fellow.
The centinel, by my defire, went for Jacobs, who was infinitely amazed to- fee me in the dreSs of a Capuchin fryar I briefly told him my adventures fince our last Separation at Ingerford-park, after our having adted the Tragedy of Julius CaeSar; and defired he would, in his turn, inform me of what had happened to him during that time.
Lie' told me, nothing very remarkable; except his having obtained a Captain’s commission,

The captain of which corps had been killed in the beginning of the adlion ; and the command had devolved upon him.
I purchased a Suit of clothes on board the man of war; and my beard being shaved, I affumed once more the charadter and appearance of a temporal being. Our ship bore down with her prize to Jamaica, where she arrived very Ibon, having a brilk trade-wind, and came to an anchor in King-:Q;on harbour.

and my heart was in no Small perturbation for the fate of the angelic creature. Upon enquiry, however, the gentle ssutterings Subfided. She had retired, it Seems, with her mother to the Blue mountains.
Eugenio was arrived from England; but was, at that time, in a remote part of the issand upon a vifit, from which he was not to return for a confiderable time..
The public was, at this time, making-merry at the expence of the Ipeaker, who had not long before married a^ young woman without any fortune, and of an obScure family, entirely for love. His former marriages, which had been confradted wholly with an interested view, had been fruitless. His last wife. Soon after their nuptials, was declared pregnant, to the infinite joy of the Speaker; who had lent three hogsheads of beer, and one of claret, to be drank upon the birth of his child. Several chaldrons of coals were fent likewise to make a bonfire upon the top of a hill, which could be leen all over the issand, and every other prepartion was made, that could mark the event with joy, festivity, and eclat.
The Ipeaker had all the attention poffi-ble for his lady during her being with child,

and waj ready to devour her with SondneSs and caresses. The carriage, in which she uSed to take the air, was ordered to go a foot-pace, and a coachman was turned a-way for preSuming to trot his horSes. Three midwives were retained, and lived four months in the houSe before she was brought to bed.
The' time of Mrs, Boat’s delivery at length arrived, when behold she brought into the world a mulatto. Epigrams and pasquinades were written, and diSperSed in all parts of the iOand. His pifture was ludicroussy drawn upon every wall and fign-post; and the Negroes compoled a Song in his honour, which was bellowed in the streets of Kingston, and in every plantation in the issand.
I wrote Lucinda a letter, in which, after a confession of the fault I had been guilty of, and the injury I had done her, offered to make her reparation by marrying her. She anSwered my letter immediatdy, and with a great deal of civility. But concluded, that a man, who was capable of ■ uSing her iii the manner I had done, was unworthy of ever being her hushand.
Upon Eugenio’s arrival in town, I prevailed upon him to go with me to make a

vifit to Lucinda; in hopes that a perSonal expostulation might have more influence than my epistolary entreaty had made; but all that I could Say was to no effedt.
My brother’s wife had still posseshon of High-grumps; and, notwithstanding my clear right to the estate, obstinately per-fisted to keep poffeffion of it; which, she Said, she had a power to do, by virtue of a deed of Settlement Humphrey had made after his marriage. Her stubbornneIs,it was evident, would be produdtive of an expen-five law-Suit, Scandal prevails between the tropics, as much as it does in the cities of London and Westminster. The story of the time in Jamaica was, that Lucinda had refuSed to marry me, becauSe I was kept out of my plantation, and, in all probability, ruined.
This report, in no Small degree, hurt Lucinda’s delicacy, which, together with her compashon for my distresses and miS-fortunes in life, had a greater influence upon her heart, than all my fine Ipeeches and protestations. A meeting between was us contrived; but I will not tire the reader with a dulstthreadbare, hackney’d account of the Soft things I Said to her,and the coy manner of her anSwering a first, and other things of the fame important kind, which Swell

Eugenio gave his Sister away, and the wedding was graced with the preSence of many people of distindlion in the issand. But let me not violate thy holy mysteries,

1	shall Say upon the Subjedl is, that they alone, whoSe hearts are SenSible of the hallowed joys of chaste love, are capable of forming a just idea of the ecstatic bliSs, with which all my Sufferings v/ere crowned.
We continued to live with Lucinda’s mother, and Eugenio, till the iffue of our legal dilpute should be known ; and as I found, that my brother’s wife stiM continued obstinately to with-hold his personal estate from me, as well as to continue in possession of High-grumps, I was under the necessity of bringing a bill in Chancery against her; to which purpole,

Thomas Pennyfeather, counsellor, Sol-licitor, and clerk in Court in this cauSc.
I deSired Mr. Pennyfeather to be as expeditious as he could in having the bill engrossed and filed, as: I had information the lady was upon a treaty of marriage with a merchant of Kingston, a man of a noto-rioussy bad charadter, who had an intention of Sending all the staves of the plantation to a lettlement he had bouo-stt in a . neighbouring Spanish colony. A fuhpcsna was accordingly forthwith isslied to compel the defendant, Elizabeth Grant, to appear ; but the lady was still obstinate, and would not deign to give Mr. Pennyfea* ther’s clerk a civil anSwer, when he Served her with a fubpcena; but abuSed his master, and the whole profession of the law, with Such a volubility of utterance, that even that pradiSer of wrangling and chicanery /
!
( 315 )
canery was confounded and astonished; we waited the stated time for her appearance, which she negledled ; upon affidavit of Service of the writ of fuhpatnay an at--lachment was iffued out against her; and upon non efi inventus., being returned, an attachment with proclamations went forth; Mr. Pennfeather declared she was the most obstinate and refradtory perSon he ever had to deal with; but did not doubt but that he should at last bring her to reaSon; as the lady stood out farther in contempt, a commission of rebellion was issued for apprehending her, and bringing her to the common priSon of the issand ; in the execution whereof the Marshals officers were authorised to break open her doors; but file always had a Servant in the mill-top, who gave her notice of the approach of any SuSpeded perSon to the houSe; and as High-grumps, from its very name, is denoted to be an elevated place, you may diScover a perSon from a considerable distance; it was therefore found expedient to Send a Serjeant at arms to the lady, which had as little effedt as all the prececding procels; for Mrs. Grant had retired into the blue mountains with her lover, who uSed Sometimes to come down to High-grumps, to inSpedt the bufineSs of the plantation; So that we
P 2	at
f
r
( 31^ )
at last obtained a Sequestration of the lands and Negroes; which, preventing their pro-greSs in the manuSadture of the Sweet commodity, the lady put in her appearance, and Sent me word, she was willing to fettle the matter by arbitration. The award being drawn, was made a rule of court, and the matter adjusted, with great equity, by the arbitrators.
I now Saw mySelf in possession of a very good plantation; and, to crown my happi-nels, Lucinda promifes, that, in nine months from our nuptials, she will bleSs me with a pledge of our loves. I have a fort of divination that whiSpcrs to me, it will be a boy ; and, if I gueSs right, I will here give a fketch of the manner in which he shall be educated.
As Soon as he is born he shall be plunged into cold water, and his head washed in it every • morning, till he is three years old. He shall be dressed in a loofe, cool robe, which shall neither bind nor confine him ; for it is undoubtedly to the injudicious method of dressing infants, the many distortions and deformities we meet every where, are chiefly owing.
Lucinda has promiSed to shew herfelf at least equal to the tigreSs or lioneSs in maternal affedtion, by Suckling her own
off-
" /
t
( 30 )
off-Spring; a duty So incumbent upon every mother, oS whatever rank, condition, or denomination, that I never yet have heard one argument, oS the least weight, endeavoured to be urged against it by thoSe, who, in all probability, have racked their imaginations, to find out Some colourable pretence to excuSe their ov</n shameSul ne-gledt.
IS Lucinda, however, should be prevented by SickneSs, or accident, Srom discharging this natural obligation, my Son shall not be Sent out, and put under the care of a mercenary nurfe, whole want of fenSibi-lity and tenderneSs, in putting away her own child, in order to take mine, for the lake of a Small pecuniary emolument, would render entirely unfit for the office. Neither shall it be dry nurSed, as that method is generally allowed to be extremely hazardous. What courSe then will you take ? He shall have a quadruped for his nurSe. The idea, you v/ill fay, is lingular ; but I know it to be pradlicable; and I maintain it to be wholSomer than his living upon any other milk than that of his mother.
Mr. Durlach, who made the Speedy tour of Italy with me, in quality of my travel-
P 3	ling
I )
ling tutor, affured me, that, in his journey through the provinces of Roussillon, Bearne, Navarre, and thole other distridls, amongst the Pyrenean mountains, he has frequently Seen (and it Ss the general cuS-tom of thole countries) children Suckled by goats ; that ani 1, Soon after it had dorgot its kid, and was accustomed to its Substitute, would come regularly to the . cradle where the child lay, and if happen-ing to be at a Small distance from the houSe, brouSing upon wild thyme and other Sweet herbs, the child should cry, well knowing the Sound of its voice,the goat would sty to it with the most affeDionate eagerneSs,and ap-peaSe it by giving it Suck. When the children can stand alone, it is natural for the pealants in thoSe parts, to go into the fields and vineyards, leaving no creature to take care of the child but the goat its nurfe. Thus much for stickling.
I agree with Rousseau, that he must cry; but, at the Same time, I will take care that it shall be as Seldom as possible; but I promiSe that philoSopher, when he falls down, or hurts himSelf, he shall not have an unnecessary dread impressed upon his tender mind, by the apprehenSion that shall be painted upon my face, or by too Ipee-

dy an assistance. When he is a year old, it will be necessary to begin the method I deSign to teach him Latin: The hint I have taken from the facetious, the eaSy and elegant Montaigne, whom I would go at least as far to fee, as Tristram Shandy would to See his favourite Cervantes. When I am reading Montaigne, I cannot help thinking T am conversing with an old man of
o	o
erudition, the utmost chearfulneSs, and a frankneSs and candour that never fails to af-fe£t us with Social and exhilerating feelings. The way his father took to instrudl him in the Latin tongue was as follows:
“ The expedient my father found out, “ for this was, that in my infancy, and be-fore I began to Speak, he committed “ me to the care of a German, who fince “ died a famous phyfician in France, to-“ tally ignorant of our language, but very '	“ fluent, and a great critic in Latin. This
“ man, whom he had fetched out of his “ own country, and whom he entertain-“ ed with a very great lalary for this end, had me continually in his arms; to whom “ there were alSo joined two others of the “ Same nation, but of inferior learning, to attend me, and Sometimes to relieve him; “ who all entertained me with no other
P 4	Ian-
4
( 320 )
language but Latin. As to the rest of “ his family, it was an inviolable rule, that neither himSelf, nor my mother, man,
“ nor maid, should Speak any thing, in “ my company, but Such Latin words as “ every one had learnt to gabble with me.
It is not to be imagined how great an ad-;	“ vantage this proved to the whole family ;
my father and my mother, by this means,
“ learning Latin Sufficiently to understand , “ it perfe(5Uy well, and to Speak it to Such “ a degree, as was Sufficient for any necd>
“ Sary uSe; as alSo thofe of the Servants “ did, who were most frequent with me;
“ to be short, we did latin it at Such a rate, that it overflowed to all the neighbouring “ villages, where there yet remain, that ‘‘ have established themSelves by custom,
“ Several Latin appellations of artizans,
“ and their tools.
“ As for what concerns mySelf, I was a-bove fix years of age before I understood either French or Perigording, any more “ than Arabic; and, without art, book,
“ grammar, or precept, whipping, or the “ expence of a tear, had, by that time,
“ learned to Speak as pure Latin as my “ master himSelf; if (for example) they “ were to give me a theme after the college
“ fashion,
«
¥
( )
“ Sashion, they gave it to others in French ; “ but as to me, they were of necessity to “ give it in the worst Latin, to turn it in-“ to that which was pure and good. And “ Nicholas Grouchi.y who writ a book Pe Co-“ mitis RomanorumWilliam Guirentes, “ who has writ a Comment upon Aristotle ; “ George Buchanan, that great Scotch ‘^poet; and Marcus Antonius Muretus, “ (whom both France and Italy have ac-“ knowledged Sor the best of his time) my “ domestic tutors, who all oS them often' “ told me, that I had, in my infancy, that “ language So very fluent and ready, that “ they were afraid to enter into difcourle “ with me; and, particularly, Buchanan, “ whom I Saw attending the late Marshal “ De Brissac, then told me, that he was a-“ bout to write a treatile of Education, the “ example of which he intended to take “ from mine; for he was then tutor to the “ Count De Brissac, who afterwards prov-“ ed So valiant and So brave a gentleman. “ He Ibon after continues:
“ He (my father) Sent me at fix years “ of age to the college of Guienne, at that “ time the most flourishing in France ; and “ there it was not poshble to add any thing “ to the care he had to provide me the
“ most
V
v«
s
( 322 )
“ most able tutors, with all other circum-“ stances of education, reServing alSo Seve-“ ral particular rules contrary to the col-“ lege pradlice ; but So it was, that, with “ all thde precautions, it was a college still. “ My Latin immediately grew corrupt, of “ vrhich aiSo, by discontinuance, I have “ fince lost all manner of uie. The first
V
“ thing that gave me any taste for books, was the pleaSure I took in reading the “ fables of Ovid’s Metamorpholes; and “ with them I was So taken, that, being “ but Seven or eight years old, I would steal “ from all other diverfions to read them; “ both by reaSon that this was my own na> “ tural language, the eaSiest book that I “ was acquainted with, and, for the SubjeD, “ the most accommodated to the capacity “ of my age. As for Lancelot du Lac, Amadis de Gaule, Huon de Bourdeaux, “ and Such trumpery, which children are “ most delighted with, I had never So much “ as heard their names, no more than I “ now know what they contain; So exaft “ was the discipline in which I was brought “ up.”
I wrote, not long ago, to a friend at Prague, and to another at Vienna, to Send me three perSons capable of executing my
pro*
__#
( 3^'B )
projedt, which are more eafily to be found in thoSe places, than in any other part ot Europe. I have often lamented, that Maupertius’s idea of a Ijatin town was never put in practice; O heavens' how much time, how many blows and fcourges, and bow infinite an expence would it net five ? My fon shall neither go to School, or the Univerfity, any more than RouS-Seau’s Emelius, or Locke’s young Gentleman. His health shall be one of my principal attentions; for I am very fenfible of the short description of a happy state in this world, a Sound mind in a found body.
I will neither have his feet wetted in cold water, or his shoes bored to let in water ; but he shall go without shoes or stockings till he is fix years of age, as the children in the remote villages do. He shall certainly learn to fwim; but I shall trouble mySelf very little whether he is costive, or otherwise, notwithstanding Mr. Locke’s particularity in this article. Lie never shall be struck, neither v:ill I accustom him to be awed. He shall be treated amicably from the beginning, and learn early to think me his best friend. He shall be inured to all hardships; and shall be taught
very '

( 324 )
very Soon to fence, and shoot with a pifi tol, by which means I shall be Sure of his courage, which is very properly defined by MonteSquiou, to be a perSuaSion of our own strength; not that I would have him quarrehbme, but he shall always confider thole arts purely as defenfive, as well as Rousseau’s Emelins.
He shall read and study RobinSon Cru-Soe; it is now transtating into Latin for his ule. But when he understands Greek, he shall not priSe Elerodotus above ail o-ther authors; 1 would as Soon have him read Glanville upon witches. Zenophon’s Cyrus shall be his favourite book ; but I wish he did not make Cyrus laugh fo much like an Idiot. ,
When he has learnt Latin of the Germans, he shall have no other tutor but my-Self; and I will, at the Same time, be the companion of his studies and purSuits, and my own example shall rather be the incitement to his application, than my precept or advice. Rousseau and Locke go into contrary extremes, and, in my humble o-pinion, are both wrong ; the former would give his pupil none but Senfible ideas till he is past twelve years of age: At eighteen, Says he, he shall not know that he

has a Soul; the latter would store him early with as many as possible. His capacity should be conSuIted ; for there are Some, who are as capable of conceiving abstradt and complex notions, and following a concatenation of ideas, at twelve years of age, as others are at eighteen or twenty.
He shall certainly learn a trade; but I do not intend to make him a joiner, like Emelius, nor a gardiner; the former is an employment that would keep him too long in one place, and generally under cover from the air or weather : The latter is a trade that encourages luxury in the world; and for that reaSon, as Rousseau justly observes, to be avoided. As to perfuming, varnishing, graving, and the polishing optical glasses, they are entirely out of the question. He shall learn hushandry; that is to Say, 1 will Set him the example my-Self, and we will go hand in hand in that art, and advance step by step. We will hire a farm of ten pounds a year, and he shall begin by driving a team, while I hold the plough, which I shall make him SenSible is necessary, as I shall be the stronger of the two; therefore the more able to perform that buSineSsjWhen he has •'^iScharged the Subordinate

ordinate, inSerior oifice of drivinsr the hor-Ses, for at leaSt four years, he shall <hen have the honour of holding the plough, which he shall be taught to look upon as Such.
The accounts of the dishurSements and profits of the farm shall be exadtly kept by both in Separate books; and at the Same time that wc acquire a knowledge and fkill in agriculture, we shall likewile get a knowledge of the method of book-keeping, or merchants accounts; in which he shall be thoroughly verSed. When we are masters of the common method of farming, and know perfedlly the nature of Soil, vegetation, the SeaSons of Sowing, the nature of grains, and the common received notions relating to hushandry, then we will begin to make experiments ; but in all our experiments we shall, in the Same piece, and in the Same Sort of Soil, continue to pradliSe in the old way upon an equal quantity of land, taking particular care to make no unreasonable allowance, either in favour, or against any System. Our agriculture shall always Serve as a relaxation to our Severer studies, and we shall endeavour to make them Serve, not only as an eaSe, but an illustration to one another.
It
( 327 )
' It is necessary, when he arrives at years of maturity, -that he should know the different manners and customs of the Several nations; and the Same perSon, who was the companion of his studies and rural labours, shall likewiSe be his attendant on his travels. He'shall not have a Spaniard for his governor, notwithstanding the excellent method in which perSons of that nation travel. Indeed, I candidly own, that I never heard of a Spaniard’s travelling, nor ever met with any perfon that did. We shall generally go in a stagecoach, or diligence, never post, but very frequently on foot. We shall stay fome times in great cities, but more frequently in final 1 ones; and shall paSs the greatest part of our time in the republican governments ; in which, however, our abode shall be proportioned to the degree of liberty they enjoy; a pure democracy shall take up more of our attention than a mixture ; and a mixed government more than an aristocracy.
