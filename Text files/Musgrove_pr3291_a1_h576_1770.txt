I again repeat, it was her lovely granddaughter, not the village, however de-lightSul its fituation or valuable its inhabitants, that I have Ib long preSerred to all your boasted world.
I own it has been at all times astonishing to me, that you, who are a fellow of the nicest dilcernment on most occafion's,
, should not be able to distinguish between stupidity and a Softer caule—elpecially as you accompanied me down on my

exchanging Eton Sor this little Ipot, and Spent one happy day with both the ladies; but I beg your pardon ; Eliza, tho’ per-Sedly charming, was then only twelve years old—and your honour Sull twice that term, consequently it was beneath your dignity to bestow much attention on -the child, notwithstanding the gld lady’s countenance, where peace and benevolence are So abundantly conSpicuous, rhade a due impression on your SenSibility.
It is with this Samily (with the addition of one Sair neighbour) that Harry Hindley and mySelS have contrived to Spend the chieS oS our time; with them we contemplated the opening beauties of the East, and confessed the milder graces of the evening ray—in a word, no elegance, wit or vivacity were wanting to gratify the lively wish, or harmonize
the Soul,
TheSe were the kind of circumstances under which your idle raillery attacked me; you cannot therefore be Surprised at its producing no other effedt than contempt Sor the author—turned of two and twenty, and a stranger to the polite follies
of the age—a terrible reproach truly

I have nevertheless been only Seeding • a stame that will at length Seed on me— Harry Hindley’s heart is equally Subdued by^ this divinity ; nor can my tender . Sentiments be once revealed without Sor-feiting his Sriendship and wounding his =
. repofe.
You are no stranger to Harry’s perfections (from my deScription I mean) either perlbnal or mental; he has indeed by much the advantage of his friend— but whilst I feel and acknowledge the justneSs and propriety of the young lady’s taste, in her too obvious preference of him to all her male acquaintance, I cannot Secure mySelf Srom the most poignant mortification,
I have had Several opportunities of Soliciting her favour—but if I had been capable of waving all regard for Harry’s peace, I should have found mylelf utterly at a loSs Sor proper language—there is a strange aukwardneSs in diScioSing the
deep-Selt attachment---but above all
things (Sor I will not attempt to palliate)

Should Mrs. Mufgrove be taken off, I doubt not but the unSortunate con Sequence would be the removal oS Eliza to London, where she would be at once beyond the reach both oS the wretched Harry and mySelS—there is not, there cannot be So amiable and accomplished a girl in your whole metropolis ; nor would I wish even you, with a leSs experienced (I SnppoSe I must not call it a hardened) heart, to behold her.
If she leaves this place I firall not long continue in it—-nothing can compenSate the loSs of her preSence—she has ever been the grand animation oS the Scene, and the flowers would Saintly bloom the instant she was withdrawn.
I would immediately on Such an event rnake you a yiSit, if my own inclinations v/ere all I had to conSult—but shall I at fast prove mySelS devoid oS Saith, Si lend-ftip. and humanity; and whilst I boldly Seek to confble my own breast, plunge a dagger in my Sriend’s, r

Now I am in the most imminent dan ger oS becoming the very thing I So much . deSpiie—a wild inconSiderate young Sellow—I have no affedions- to bestow —no eledion to make, and whatever connedion I may be induced to have

But, Frederic, let this disappointment be produdive of ever Such unpleaSmg effeds in my condud, take notice, I will not abate you an inch of that duty or reSped the being born your uncle entitled me to.
The early marriage oS your mother, and the late birth oS your humble Servant, expoSed you to a double misSortune—the

T© give you your due, however, I must confeSs you have borne the grievance (ever Since my knov/ledge of it at least) with manly fortitude—fondly claSped your bane in your generous arms, and doated on the mushroom that So unSeaSonably Sprung up in your way. Yes, that you are a valuable nephew, friend, and companion, I have always granted you—but why will you"' not be uniformly valuable-— your intimacy with lord Hindley, and the unworthy opinion you entertain of the' women, are what greatly disturb me— be admonished—what you now call gallantry, in a more Serious hour will affume another name—and prove a Source of endleSs and unavailing compunction.
There goes Harry, apprehenfion and deSpondenceon his brow—I cannot blame him—nor are all my alarms inSerior to his.

Mulgrove,
LETTER I. 9
MuSgrove, iS Same may be relied on, has So narrow and corrupt a Soul, as to be capable of making an adual property of his child, and expoSing her to Sale at the first promising market.
I should like to receive Ibme account of the whole family as Soon as possible, to enable me to form a just judgment of my Eliza’s Situation. If I am not deceived in my opinion of the old fellow’s dist poSition, my title and fortune would be no ill recommendation of your uncle. But, Harry, there is the distreSs—was he not the friend of my infancy, the first born object of my tender affeCtions—-but shall I then fink under the evil, I dare not attempt to redreSs.? No, Frederic;
I will (if Mrs. Mulgrove is restored to us) play a more diScreet. and polite part.
Harry has hitherto caught all his impressions from me; for the first Sigh that was breathed for MiSs MuSgrove, was breathed by your Edward. Could I with . the Same facility but teach him to make a Second choice—it would be a blessed • piece of finesse—nor is Mils Harley in any degree exceptionable (tho’ this un-

happy youth, as well as mySelS, conSiders her as a mere latellite in compariibn with our Sweet mistreSs)—how would I then bend my muScles to an affedation oS a passion I could not Seel; and having once fixed him Mils Harley’s admirer, reaffume my primitive faith, and render us all compleatly happy.
I am lenlible how truly ridiculous I must appear to a man oS your cast, who proSeffes himSelS incapable, nay, glories in being of the weakneSs I am now manifesting—but give me leave to tell you in return—that tho’ there may be a joy in your lels interesting purSuits, it must be a licentious joy; conlequently equally delpiSed by the village Swain, as his Softer concerns by you.

And nothing leSs, my good uncle,
will SatisSy you, than the characteristics oS the MuSgrove Samily—yet am I aSraid, my compliance with your re-^ quest will be productive of very Small SatisSadlion to you, as the lines are by no means Savourable to yours, or your Harry’s caule.
Mulgrove’s connexions'are- gay' and ■ extenfive, but Sor your comSort, he brings but Sew vifitants home—declaredly to avoid the restraint his wife’s preSence would communicate, where licentiouSneSs pastes for wit, or the forward cenSures of his upstart children.

improprieties to the utter restedtion on the taste of his friends, but abfolutely careS-led, for being a man of entertaining faculties—and whilst the world will continue this pradlice, what reformation can be expedled ! His principles, I believe, either moral or religious, are still unfixed; and So little tenderneSs, nature, and Sen-Sibility has fallen to his share, that provided his own purpoSes are but anSwer’d —no Sacrifice would be deemed too great in his estimation. He married from the unworthiest of motives—Self-interestedneSs and Self-gratification. The lady’s birth and accomplishments flattered his vanity, her perSon plealed his eye, while the mild perfedlions of her heart promiSed him the utmost exultations of tyranny and pride. She yielded herSelf implicitly to the will of her relations, and has for years endured the most ungenerous treatment without complaint—he boasts that never man was more blessed, tho’ no man on earth ever made Such ill returns Sor unremitting indulgence as himSelf.
His daughter Mary inherits all the graces of her father’s perSon as well as temper, and it is So natural for us to

Two little boys and a Sweet-diSpostd girl are wholly at her mercy and command ; for she gives what impreshon she pleaSes of every adfion or objedt to MuSgrove’s breast, an unhappy circumstance for your
Eliza.
But, Edward, is not your behaviour very extraordinary reSpedting this young lady—if she had on any occafion acknowledged her preference of Harry to yourSelf; Silence and Sighing would, I
grant you, be your only reSource---
but as the cast is, how can you be certain of her stntiments—I would bring matters to a fair trial—he should make his application; and if SucceSs was not his portion, you might then honestly inquire what you had to trust to.

LETTER III.
Mifs Musgrove to Mifs Harley.^
I THANE you, my dear good girl, Sor your well-timed condolance—to dole the eyes of a tender and valuable relation, was a fcvere and melancholy talk, especially alone and unassisted by that Sriend who was never- beSore under a necessity of absenting hcrSelS Srom the village—the neceshty was, however, no lest ill-timed than indiSpenSible; and we ought both oS us to Submit to it without com-plaint.
I am aSraid this misSortune will be pro-dudfive oS many others—So alarming a change in my circumstances, cannot but be Succeeded by as alarming a change in my Situation; Sor you are very Senstble that my dear grand-mamma’s jointure (which devolves to her eldest Ion) tho* considerable, was but ill-proportioned to her generous heart. Was there a diS-treSs that ever reached her knowledge she

could reSist relieving; or a grieS that wag unwept or uncompassioned. by her ?
My dear child, she would frequently Say to me, it will never be in my power to make a proper proviSion Sor you—but I will teach you the happy art oS being Satisfied with a little—your Sather is a man of fine genius and abilities, and your mother’s fortune will enable him to push himSelf in life—but his family is large, and he has already exhausted his patrimony as a younger brother—therefore tho’ there is no reaSon to apprehend your wanting, a proviSion—there can be no harm in guarding against every possible contingence—and believe me, the girl who has not learned to confine her wishes, and regulate her expences—and contem.plated as well the humble as exalted walks of life, is but ill-qualified to make a figure in either the one or the other. My few jewels, plate, and a very Small restrve of money, is all I have to bestow—yet perhaps even thole trifles may give you an uneaSy distindion in the houSe of your father, whenever you may have occaSion to return to it—Brothers
and Sisters will think equality their due

This lesson is now become my only relburce; and it is by a proper observance oS it alone, that my little bark can Sail with any tolerable Security. My brothers and Sisters are almost entire strangers to . me in every particular—I have indeed been brought up with the tenderest impressions oS them, but what I have to expedt at their hands is altogether uncertain ; yet the being the eldest of all my • Sather’s children, I should imagine, my Harley, could not Sail to give me Some consideration—and the rest will in great meaSure depend on my own behaviour. My mother’s dilpofition I know to be Sar from exceptionable—bear SoSt, my pen— for is it not my other parent 1 would arraign—we will, we ought to leave all ft theSe things in the boSom of futurity, nor

I have but one real difficulty to con^ tend with—^Our friend Harry Hindley is now one and twenty, and has too much thrown off the boy,_ to be any longer, in*. dulged in all thoSe pleaSing Samiliarities he So late enjoyed.

Lord Hindley is^ indeed, an mtimate of my father’s—but Harry is too unSor*-tunate a Son, to claim any toleration on that account. He could, not viSit me, however prompted by. inclination; nor if even that was practicable, would it be possible for the peculiarity of his attention to eScape the observation of my relations—he has. nothing to recommend him to the approbation of age and experience—for there, there, my Harley, would that finished form, that inexpressibly

I am now in my eighteenth year; and as my beloved grand-mama has thought fit to appoint that the diScretional period, I ought to give mySelf conSequence, and be an exam.ple to all thoSe that are younger than my (elf—and you, my kind girl, will, at your return, infallibly reconcile him to the necessity of my affairs.
Perhaps it may be best for both, that our friendship should know fome bounds —my prolpedis are as little flattering as his—nor must I ever hope to be lady Hindley. .

From the Same to the Same.
IT is all over, my Harley, and I at a most wretched distance Srom the happy village. Harry made many efforts to fpeak to me, but Sir Edward was the unkind and perpetual interruption; nor do I think L shall ever Sorgive him.
My mother tenderly reproved me Sor my too apparent reludance to accompany her ; and declared, that iS she had Sore-Seen the alienation oS my affediions would have been the conSequence oS my being brought up Srom under my paternal root, no consideration on earth should have prevailed on her to have luffered me to quit it.
Happy perhaps had it been Sor her poor Eliza, iS—but it cannot be recalled, and we must make the best oS it.
The young Sriends begged leave to Sup with us, or more properly to be permitted to Sit at the Supper-table—they neither

ther of them eat any thing, nor was my appetite over keen—Sir Edward, with an officioulhels that hurt me no leSs on the recollection, than in the practice, for ever met my eye^; and as I had not the confidence to indulge them under his observation, as I could have wished, I fixed them on my plate, in anguish-and diffa-tisfaCIion.
The next morning brought them again to the hall—my distreSs was unlpeakable —and to compleat the whole, when we got into the chariot. Sir Edward contrived to fasten my mother upon his friend, whilst I was compelled to accept his unwelcome hand; and we were Ibon, too Soon, removed beyond the utmost straining of their fight.
We arrived at Hanover-fquare only last night, and at a very late hour, a flight accident or two unexpectedly detaining us; and as I was much fatigued, (at least in mind) my good mother infisted on my retiring, after a little refreshment, without waiting my father’s return from a neighbouring tavern, where he happened to be engaged. But notwithstanding I went to bed, repoSe was what I Sought in

vain, until about three in the morning, when I was instantly awaked, and terribly alarmed by a conSuSion of male voices in the dining-room.
I hope theSe midnight revels are not very ushal—but, my dear mother, iS you can patiently Support them, well may I—■ Six and thirty is too early a period Sor fb fine, Ib amiable a woman to Sink into the groSSest negledt—I have done, I have done, my Sriend, and do you obliterate the daring cenSure.

them in Lincolnshire-Patty will never-
thelefs, I believe, be still the Savourite—• she has shch an uncommon share oS SweetneSs and Senstbility; and her attention to her mother is Ib truly amiable. The two boys appear haughty and confident----but there is no Sorming a proper
judgment, on So short an acquaintance —and I find in all events they are more pitiable than blameable—as too great indulgence will ruin the best turned diSpo-fition. I am impatient to know if you have Seen any thing of Harry, and how he bears my Sudden departure—Friend-

I have promised my listers to prelent each oS them Ibme little ornament out oS my colledlion the day I am eighteen, as they will then become my undoubted property, on the strength of which, I flatter mySelf, the preceding months will paSs Smoothly away—Shall I confels to you, my Harley, that I had the mortification to find it necessary in Ibme degree to Sacrifice my interest to my peace-And

HOW compleatly miSerable, my dear
Eliza, has your departure rendered me ! Never talk to me oS your Harry—-what are your Harry’s fufferings to mine —his maSculine charaOer v/ill enable him to Sollow whereSoever you sty—but I, alas, must yield to the helpIestiieSs, the insufficiency of my Sex; and whilst ray heart pants after you and London, remain in the odious Solitude of my ancestors.
Why have I not expressions adequate
to my Seelings-------my stars, the fates,
what would I not accuSe-------yet you can
give up your Harley with an offenSive phi-loSophy, and only Sigh ard lament for a filly boy ; who, with all his deServings, ought not Surely to have been admitted in competition with Such a friend as I.
It is a grievous restedlion, that, in all probability, if we could have continued a Sew months longer as we were Situated,
only
L E T T E R V. 27
only a Sew days ago, Edward and Harry had been our own. Yet I verily believe, on more mature consideration, it is much better as it is,—Sor iS I have any dilcern-ment (and who except yourSelS would once dare to call it in question) my Sair Sriend was the univerSal deity.
Harry has a warmth in his nature, that cannot be Ib ealily restrained as the more amiable Edward’s—but, depend upon it, the one was your open, the other your Secret admirer; and that all that behaviour that gave you So much dilpleaSure at parting, claimed, at least, your compass-lion ate toleration.
Believe me, my dear Eliza, the hours we have Spent, the days we have shared, can never be Sufficiently regretted ——It was innocence—the most refined and perSedI innocence, that gave the gout to our enjoyments—not one ungentle paS-fion to ruffle the Sweet Serenity—not one stern guardian to Srown us into diston-tent; but all was harmony, and all was love.

Yet, Set your heart at rest; your beloved Hindley’s grieS is in no danger of destroying him—I grant you it is lively, it is inceiSant—it is, indeed, to lay the truth, very little inferior to my own—• but it is unrestrained—O think, if you can, unmoved, of the lover and the friend; how strong, how generous must his conssidls be—but he is born as unfortunate as mySelf, and will live and die a prey to hopeleSs affedtion.
The arrival of each of your letters was likewise produdtive of a viSit from Hind-ley ; the Sly inquiSitive youth, it Seems, Spent half the day at the post-houSe, and -was with me by the time I had broke the

He has communicated his intention of leaving us this very week, and Harry is reSolved to remain as short a time after his friend as possible.

IAifs Musgrove, to Mifs Harley.
T AM, my Harley, a very unhappy j. being, nor shall the cauie be concealed.
Notwithstanding my Sather’s great endowments, and the Sortune he received with my mother, I have the unhappinels to find his circumstances have been for
Ibmetimein a declining state-and that
• all the additional Splendor he thought proper to diSplay, was insufficient to hide Srom the diScernment oS Sriendship, the real perplexity he labours under.
I believe I can already SoreSee what will be the conlequence—I am not now many
weeks Srom eighteen--can I behold the
iTiiSery oS my Samily, and not endeavour to remove itAll I may become post Seffed oS shall be theirs, and I will chear-Sully stibmit to share my Sister’s Sate.
I shall, I SuppoSe, on the whole, be worth rather more than three thouSand
pounds
L E T T E R VI. 31
pounds—a Sum that would have amply anSwered all my humble views—but to live Sor ourSelves alone, was never the intention oS Providence—and iS charity or generoSity v/as ever amiably exerted, it must be on Such an occaSion as the one beSore me. I am quite angry with you, Sor persisting in your strange opinion respecting Sir Edward—me the impediment ,to his approbation oS you—dilcard the thought—my diSpoSition is in no degree calculated to his taste—he has understanding, he has great goodneSs oS heart------
but his vivacity, and my gravity, are glaring and irreconcileable contradictions.
Was there a possibility of awakening him to a SenSe of his Selicity, I should* .never be dissatisfied with the place he liolds in your esteem—but depend upon it, my too Sufceptible girl, he will Soon become a general admirer of the Sex; nor once think of fixing (agreeable to the conduO of all Such lively gentlemen) until age or infirmity point out the necessity. Had he Harry’s steadinefs or principles, I would not thus diScourage you. But it is clear to me, that he is that Sort of being, that will be implicitly hurried down the
B 4	Scream

stream ofliSe, without reflection, const-deration, or permanent SatisSaCtion.
Lord Hindley is Srequently at our hoiife, and I assure you, honours your Sriend with peculiar attention—Did he know a man that he could perSuade himSelSmeritedme, how warmly would he eSpouSe his interest —can he Sorget how nearly he himSelS is allied to the first excellence ; or does he only addreSs me in the true courtier stile, without either meaning or Sentiment?
1 have Sormed a deSign, and yon, my Harley, must pray Sor its SucceSs. To pleafe Lord Hindley, to communicate a Savourable impression oS my deServings to his heart, is now my only cai'e ;—nor have I any reafbn hitherto to repent my toil—He every day Seems to regard me with additional complacence, and to lend
a more willing ear to all ray prattle--1
have even gone Ib Sar as to mention my
intimacy with his Son---and if he has
much penetration, I doubt not but he will read the rest—how alarming this inSatua-tion—what rest—what is there Sor him to read ? My Sorward inclinations, and his Son’s modest reServe--—I would, but cannot
LETTER VI. 33
not Spare mySelf this mortifying convidtion of my indistretion and folly.

WELL, my dearest Eliza, you have
at last contrived to make a won-derSul figure in the eyes oS yor Sriend.
So you are difplaying all your fine accomplishments to catch the old Hindley’s approbation, in order to obtain an interest . in his Son,—but I can tell you, it requires t ho stipernatural wiSdom to SoreSee a very: contrary, effed.
His lordship is nofmuch turned offiSty; and when you clap his title and Sortune in the oppoSite Scale to his infirmities, cannot be deemed an ineligible lover—nor would you,; in the charatier. oS a mother- -in-law, Sail to shine.

Indeed, my dear, you must be very cautious what connetftions you Sorm, or you will be the destruction oS this young Seilow, who, I am poSitive, is not halS So SenSible oS his own existence, as your charms; or would Suffer any bleffing to come in competition with your dear, your deSirable approbation.
I have my regrets, my languishments ; —for Sir Edward Selwyn is no longer at the village—but I am reSolved to turn all my attention to the Supporting and con-Soling your poor drooping Harry. This Second stroke, my Eliza, has quite undone him; nor is his obdurate Sather to be prevailed upon to allow him to come to London, notwithstanding all the judicious remonstrances of the good old parSon, who inSists upon it, that it is the greatest injustice both to his pupil and the public, to let him remain any longer in obScurity.
TheSe Lords are a kind oS hard natur’d beings, I think—one would imagine he would be impatient to behold So riSing a ;genius—but on the contrary--—^he is meanly afraid oS being elbowed at places oSpolite reSort, by So accomplished a youth as all the world would proclaim his Son to

Sir Edward is now at Buxton ; he mentions both the place and the company with great indifference—I know a lady^ wlioSe preSence could render it a paradile, nor can I wonder it is tasteleSs without her.
, Nothing could be more tender, or nobly interesting, than the last Scene between thefe young friendSi

But all was ineffectual—Sor whilst the gentle Harry acknowledged himSelS aS-SeCted, and but ill capable oS reSisting the united rhetoric of friendship and inclination, he declared himSelf determined to forget the tyrant, in order to revere the father; and never, on any provocation, renounce the obedience God and nature
required of him------They parted with

I am grieved to hear of your father’s,

of the dead-----to fee miSery gathering
around you; and instead of sheltering yourSelf, invite its utmost violence, ap-^ pears to me to be contrary to every dictate of nature and propriety.
At least, my Sweet girl, let me prevail on you to relerve a Srnall annuity against an evil hour. I should not

up whatever esse you may be entitlai to, return to that peaceful Ipot from which your mother Ib injudicioufiy conveyed you. I can never forgive mylelf for not flying home to prevent our long Separation, by convincing that lady how unnecessary it was for you to expoSe yourSelf to the brow-beatings of a parcel of little unjudging beings—but though the fault, the omission, cannot be recalled, it may be retrieved; and I inSist upon it, that Ib proper a compliment is paid to my advice, that one more week at farthest may restore you to she wishes

YOLJ'R Salutary, your most judicious advice,, m>y Harley, reached me too late to be Serviceable—I had, in .a moment of filial apprehenSion, offered my father all^—and with great difficulty prevailed upon him to promiSe to accept it.
It is a-grating circumstance, my Eliza, cried' he, to be compelled by cruel
necessity to rob my ehild^-why will
you enter So tenderly into the distresses of a man, whom thllworld in general is dilpoSed to condemn for inattention to his family, and freedom of living—— should you. repent' your generossty—you are fenSibie of my inability to restore what you are So defirous to Sorego. Consider well the conSequences, for be assured, no evil in nature would bear So heavy on the heart of your Sather, as
the

the brow-beatings of his own miserable offspring.
How was my very Soul Searched by this behaviour—O Sir, Said I, Spare me,
I beSeech you, on this occaSion-you
gave me being, and it is alone by your parental indulgence, that I am in a capacity of being Serviceable to you — you have no child that could do lest for you, and it was your own pleaSure, that I should recommend mySelf to my dear grand-mamma; or you would have been master of what I am entitled to by a different claim'—only permit me to enjoy the felicity of a paternal roof, and an equivalent portion of. your approbation with my brothers and Sisters; shall I not then be amply reqompenced ?
There is Something great, returned my father, I must confeSs, in this condiA
of yours, if it is but Sincere-women
are often Subjecft to theSe Softnesses, thele starts of heroiSm—Yet I will not prejudge you-—nor shall I long be impoSed upon—your will must be as pliant, your obedience as exemplary, and your Self-negle(ft as meritorious on every future demand, as you have now shewn them,

or I shall deem you tardy---1 stifferno

Be affured. Sir, that ycur happinefs will at all times be dearer to me than even life itSelS—nor can I prove So weak or unworthy as to make a merit of my duty-----do you but obliterate the re-
membrance oS this day’s tranSaCiion as perfedlly Lrom your breast as 1 Sliall
from mine-----He preSSed ray hand and
retired : my mother’s tender professions were inexpreffibly wounding, but I at length Soothed all her agitations into peace.
And now, my dear, am I as destitute of every hope or expediation of a pro-visson, as if my worthy affeDionate grand-mamma had been ever So deficient in her care or kindneSs. But let it go '—the necessity was irreSistible; and if the grave has knowledge of the actions of the living, even the pardon of my indulgent beneSadtreSs must be mine.
Yet my Situation (I cannot SuppjeSs, the acknowledgment) v/ill never be a happy one—I have neither Sri end nor
companion
LETTER VIII. 43
companion in any of my relations, nor the power or opportunity oS Seeking them Srom any other quarter; and my days are past in recollections that have much more oS pain than pleaSure in them. You must not mistake me, tho’ the iinhappinels I thus lament, is alone produced by the malignity oS my Sister Mary’s diSpoSition—she governs the family, possesses both her Sather’s heart and eat; nor dare my mother indulge the affectionate impulSe of her nature, or the Sweet Patty her tenderneSs, under the malicious eye of this overgrown favourite, Sor fear oS mistepreSentation.
Should any thing very unfortunate deprive me of a paternal roof, be ashired, the village is the place I would sty to— I know the generoSity of your compo-fition too well not to confide in it; nor will I have So mean an opinion of my own abilities as to conceive mySelf incapable of being uleful in shch a family as yours. Perhaps, my dear girl, our‘ re-union is much nearer than you may imagine; fori have no Small realbn to shlpeCt that my little Sacrifice will rather amuSe than Satisfy my father’s creditors ;

and that a still greater calamity is in store Sor us—to aggravate all which, it is vrhiS-pered, that Some late ill-fucceffes at play are on the point of tranSpiring-:—and heaven only, knows where it will end.
I have likewise another alarm that I must'Communicate; this miSerably mil-taken father, has, my dear, a strange Scheming turn,, and I overheard him the other day, lamenting to one of his bottle companions, that all his girls were not marriageable; as he could then diSpole of them to the greatest advantage—but a brace or two of years, he added,, (with Some expressions that shock me on the recollection) would blast the flattering pEoSpeCt,, and render them drug? upon his hands.
Here I confels Ifeelmystlf vulnerable —•Poverty, all the evils of life that are in general the most formidable to a youthful mind, have no terrors, for me when compared with renouncing ray last fond hope of one day—but Spare me, my good Harley,, and let me fly the horrible idea.
And yet to behold' the too probable, if not actually impending stroke, and
not
LETTER VIII. 45
not endeavour to mitigate it, iS to avert it should be impracticable, is the height of folly and madnels. I will therefore from this hour, begin to prepare mySelf —and as a most essential step, remember, the name of Hindley must never more fall from our pen—to feed So un-promiSing a flame, is to deServedly incur the punishment of disappointment that would infallibly await it. I need not be told that we are both Sufficiently ill qualified for a life of industry and inconvenience ; and I cannot imbibe the extravagant faith, that love alone is a lecurity for matrimonial felicity.
For me, the lesson of humility is held forth by the hand of reaSon ; nor shall it be held forth in vain—but as Harry is master of many fine accomplishments, and So nearly allied to nobility, he may confidently look forward to better days,. No woman of whatever rank or fortune would be degraded by her election of him, and I now as Sincerely wish the friendship he bears me may never prove an impediment to his advancement, as I was once childishly ambitious oShis being irrevocably attached to me.
How

IS we could elope, it should be Srom a very different motive—To avoid the indignity and weight of chains is one thing, and to purchaSe them at the most unworthy price, another—But your mother and her helplels children—your own humanity, firmneSs, and long-tried principles, Eliza, must determine you.
And yet, my much beloved and fatally deServing friend, is there no possibility of redeeming them without loSing you— Must then all the graces of your perfbn be blighted by Silent afflidion, and the beauties of your difpofition obicured by never-dying diScontent—I am incapable of advifing you—nor must I dwell on the too painful fubjed.

Was viSibly ill-affedted towards my cOn-trading an intirriacy there.
I thought it was very extraordinary Sor a man (naturally ostentatious) to conceal intentions that did him Ib much honour —and yet Lord Hindley was ever dilin-clined to make his Son the Subjec^t oS his conversation, nor on any occaSion proclaimed what your letter imported.
MuSgrove and his Lordship were both abfent; the impatient youth then deSired that the young lady might be made ac-qiiainted with our viSit—she came down —Harry’s raptures happily Secured him Srom too nice observations on her altered countenance—but I was peculiarly alarmi-ed by it. Her whole behaviour was constrained and timidly Significant—Now the SoSt eye oS compassion was turned upon Harry, and again the Sound oS Sect in the lobby drew it apprehenssvely an oppoSite way—There is no deferibing it. —But at length the opening door threw her into an adual tremor; which was rather increafed than mitigated, by our being Summoned to attend the brace oF unnatural fathers at a tavern.

Harry’s worthy confidence and lively gratitude were his protection—it would,, Said he, (as we passed along) have been equally blameable and impolitic to have; delayed complying with this however unwelcome request; as I shall Xo (bon fee her again to my utmost SatisSaCtiom
My lord affeCted to receive him with great cordiality—but be assured, it was only affected; and whenever the youth caught at an opportunity to proSeSs his grateSul SenSe oS his intended goodneSs,. always interrupted hnn and changed the
Subj eCt.
He then told him (flightly apologizing for the necessity) that he must get him to take a ride into Kent, upon particular buSinels; he yielded even to this propoSal with astonishing resolution; only reSolv-ing, as he privately acknowledged to me, to make Somewhat quicker dilpatch than his Sather had mentioned.
I never once Saw his lordship during his absence, The Sixth morning brought him to London; and tho’ aukwardly early Sor a vistt, no arguments could prevail upon him to Sorbear attempting at least to fee his beloved.
But

But how was he chagrined on finding a coach and Six at the door, and his Sather condudfing the halS-dying Sair one into it to be conveyed to Bath !

Yet notwithstanding all his mortification and regret, he is perSeDly unSuSpi-cious of his greatest misfortune. Depend upon it. Sir Edward, this most amiable girl is either already (or on the very point of being) Sacrificed to this barbarian of a lord.
I would ad vile you to go immediately to Bath, and starch into the affair—'on Such a contingence, Harry’s miSery, by being incapable of every Ipecies of alleviation, will claim our united tenderneSs —f»and you may in all relpedts rely on

Could you conceive it possible to Silence injuries like mine by fo paltry a method ? what is a proviSion where liSe itSelS is not worth that care ? you have robbed me of all that I ever held valuable, and I fcorn to join hands with you on any occasion.
Harry, Harry, anSwered his lordship, do you know who it is that you are thus inSulting?
Yes, Sir—^—you are the man that I have considered and honoured as my Sather—but how little your condudt has^ corresponded with that endearing cha-ra<5ler, the v/orld will bear you witneSs^— Was I not buried in oblcnrity, denied the privilege oS a paternal rooS, and excluded from every, Species of paternal indulgence—until, by Some Satal accident, you dilcovered it was in your power to effecfl my destruction—when I was called

that has deprived me ot every fond delu-Sion-—the mother and the bn are irreconcilable distinctions; but whilst defpon-dence and reSentment are our portion, the bitterneSs of remorle cannot fail to find you out.

Soothed it into repentance, compassion, and generous conSuSion—•—I would, by shewing you the Sad product of your industry with reSpeCt to me, have incited you to Ipare the dearer part of me all further persecution—But it will not be:

All my intercourst with Lady Hindley must now be at an end; Sor as I have on all occaSions been the Sriend and confidant oS the Son, it cannot be expeded that the Sather should be over-Sond oS my poffefling her Ladyship’s ear or approbation.

I was more than once tempted to have diSclofed my fentiments to the little good-natur’d girl, and have got her by Some means to Search out the particulars of Harry’s proceedings—But heaven was too gracious to permit me to Sink So much beneath my uSual dignity ; notwithstanding all the deluSions of a fond imagination—that would have represented the demands of duty and conScience as proper to be anSwered—and that not to bestow attention on Such a Son, was an affedation that could not Sail to betray

A Sew moments before we were hurried from Bath, Sir Edward contrived to fee me—• he was exceedingly diScompoSed at our abrupt departure, and to the last degree inquisttive refpedling my Sister’s health— He must, my dear madam, be a very tender hearted gentleman,. I am convinced, no lefs in this parting interview, than one or two former one& we had abthe rooms: Yet I cannot help thinking it very extraordinary that he should So earnestly intreat me to Support,, amufe, and comfort Lady Hindley—What deficiency or inattention can he have discovered in me I own I am rather hurt by ' the bare infinuation of my want of natural affediion—but he is too well bred and too generous to offend any one intentir onally ; and as the cauSe of the little inconsistency with his general charader, which I have taken notice of^ can be no more than stis over-abundant friendship for my Sister,* I ought not only to excuSe, but to honour him for it.
He

, He begs that you would write to Lady Hindley, and Set the affair in the IbStest light imaginable.; but it is his opinion that Sor the better concealment oS the most dreadSulcircumstance, Some inSerior ones should be communicated: But above-all things he recommends the abSolute assurance of his having leSt the kingdom., as the grand effential to restore her peace.
I need Say no more to you, madam, on this head ; your own tendernels and difcretion (to borrow Sir Edward’s ex-preffion^) will be your best instrudor; but it was necessary to give you his plan; or I should not have preSumed to didtate to MiSs Harley.
What a strange turned mind Lord Hindley’s must be—He married my Sister by the cruellest compulfion that ever Surely was pradliSed—Yet would you believe it, madam, he is at times little better than a madman ; Sor ever more rendering her unhappy, when at home, by his teafing ways; and Sollowing her when in public, as iS he apprehended he should loSe her. I can tell you, he was never shuch delighted with Sir Edward’s addressing her; tho’ he well knew how
old

old an acquaintance he was oS her ladyship’s, and could not deny his being a very agreeable gentleman. I thought his happinels would have at least continued to the end, and shat the promotion oS my Sister’s would have been his incessant care, or I should not have borne to have Seen her lacrificed even with the refolution I did; let whatever would have been the conSequence.
Nothing can be more pleaSant than the houSe we are now at—but if his lordship will not change his humour, w hat but miSery can be her portion .? He will break her ladyship’s heart, and what would liSe be to me without her ? Ah! madam, iS Sir Edward Selwyn had but been my brother, how I should have , doafed on him; or even Mr. Hindley might have made my Sister very happy— but the adlion he has been guilty of, rather inclines me to give his friend the preSerence; for is it not Something oS a piece with the unaccountable violence of his father.

When you have convinced yourSelf of the tye. that now SubSists between you, and duly weigh the unavailableneSs and i.mpropriety of every SoSter consideration, you will find it no hard talk to confels yourlelS his rnothery or breathe the figh that is truly maternal.
But don’t be diScouraged, if this change is not altogether So eaSily effeDed as you could wish—A.blence, reflection, piety, and necessity, will all contribute to aid the work v/hen once properly undertaken—We could hardly have flattered ourSelves that lucn an affair could blow over with Ib little conSuSion ; and tho, I ofrant you, there is much to lament,

There is Ibmething very extraordinary, my dear, in this Lord’s behaviour—He torments both himSelf and rne, from exceSs of affedion as he calls it—He found me once in tears—it was a flagrant offence—And another time, notwithstanding every difagreeable circumstance, he happened to come into my dressing-room, when Patty had just called forth a tranSient Smile—nor do I know which occaSioned him the greatest mortification.
He has never once mentioned his Son’s name to me, from what motives he can best tell—I am neverthelefs much relieved by your account of his having quitted England; for whether love or diSgust is the incitement, the conSequences may be equally happy to us both—Yes, my Harley, I can now Safely assure you the storm is quite laid^—the matrimonial
yoke
*
L E T T E R XXIV. >27
yoke properly assumed, and every rebellious inclination at rest; and you may hereaSter write of him, how and when ' you pleale—For to Spend my liSe with him was not half So essential to my fc’* Ikity, as to know him exempt from Suffering from any fault or misfortune of mine—We are very young, and'it is not impossible but we may one day meet the happiest of friendsj tho’ we should havb proved the most wretched of lovers.
My Situation will certainly require peculiar nicety, to Secure me from many mortifications ill luited to the delicacy of my nature. My Lord’s connexions, we are all fenfible, have been Inch as can have given him no very favourable impressions of the Sex—but my condudt shall, if possible, defeat the utmost malice of Suspicion; and command his reSpedt, tW his caprice should be un-Subdued.
The fweet Patty is beyond meaSure dejedled; at what she is unable to comprehend—TTo have married me only to make me miserable, is a Species of gallantry she cannot enter into—and when I Speak encouragingly to her—she only
F 4	weeps
128 LETTER XXIV.
weeps her lister’s hard Sate; and in Ipit^ oS all my chidiiig, will wish that Sir Edward Selwyn had been born for her brother in stead oS So unaccountable an old gentleman.
There is to be a great stag hunt next week, in this country, as I shppoSe the papers have informed you; Lord Hind-ley has engaged himSelS—but he is stich a mifer.^ that perhaps he may prefer watching over his ill-gotten Jiore^ to all the pleasures of the chale—I need not
explain to you what I mean on this oc-
casion.
I will take the opportunity of his ab-fence to write to you more largely on every fubjedt; for when I know him in the houle, I cannot but be apprehenSive that our correlpondence is in danger of being interrupted—A circumstance too alarming not to teach me the utmost caution.
This place is a kind ofpalace—But what cliarms either its Situation or magnificence can have for my heart, I leave to you to judge, who are So well acqiuinted v^ith its natural humili ty, and the poignance of its regrets.

NOW let them do their worst—not
another tear, another complaint' shall they extort Srom me—I have Seen this injured Harry, been witneSs to all his endearing distrefs, and will fit down and own mySelS overcome.
The morning the stag was to be
turned out. Lord Hindley arole for the
p'urpoSe of purluing it——but with an
irreSoiution (fufficiently justified by the
consequence) quitted his home, as if
Some much apprehended evil was at hand.
Patty and I met at the breakfast table

death; and were glad of even the most

I lervant threw open the door-—A gentleman Srom Lord Hindley—It instantly occurred to me that Some accident had befallen him; and as violent deaths will shock the tender mind, I for the first moment experienced a SenSation that had nothing to do with diSgust or reSentment.
I lifted up my eyes—to cloSe them' again for a long period—it was Harry ; the milcrable, dejedled, ruined Harry— He caught me in his arms, and with great prelence of mind restrained Patty from calling assistance, and expoSing me to my family,

now only to indulge myfelf with one
last Sad view of that precious Sace, and—
Mr. Hindley was always good—and, Eliza, had I but been appriSed of your intention, it most affuredly should have been prevented—I have a friend—his fortune -would have been at my command, nor would I have heSitated to make uSe of it in stich a cauSe—Your father’s circumstances should have been rendered eaSy, and tho’ the employment Lord Hindley has procured him had been withheld—could he have complained —I have a great dependence on an im-cle, his possessions are unbounded, and as all will be mine at his deceaSe, we might have ventured to anticipate—if you had not been Ib precipitate—
My hushand, Sir—Death and destruction, exclaimed he, what would you fay—O Madam, that hushand and Sather —I will not rave—^But do not name him again, I shall asse nothing at your hands unfit for you to grant—your pardon, your blessing, your promile of tender re-Xnembrance, is all I would Solicit—And

Lady Hind LEY to Mt/s Harley.
Your observation, my dear, is
but too just, that times must be Very dreadSul, when writing to your Eliza becomes a difficulty, which is most
evidently the preSentcaSe—This last consolation however remains with us—they cannot be much worst, let come what
may; and to be relieved Srom Sushenst IS no inferior blessing.
^ It is impossible to defcribe the Singularity of his Lordship’s diSpofition—what delights him one moment, diSgusts him the next; and I am ever too melancholy, or too gay, for his repoSe.
That he has an affedtion for me in his way, is most undoubted; but it is his own gratification (as in the instance of buying me) that he is eternally Seeking, and by which he defeats his deSired pur-post 'Was he capable of but one distn-terested adtion, would he for example
give

give me an opportunity of enjoying the company of my friend, a Smile of approbation would infallibly await him— But he will leize, not win my heart ; and instead of breaking open, he only strengthens every avenue ; and will never gain the Slightest footing there.
Yet becauSe I have not already Sufficient impressions to his disadvantage, she has thought proper to add the irreSistable, charm of jealouSy to the number—Jealous of his own shadow, my Harley, for Such is the life I lead, that Scandal ite
felf would ficken at the view—I never

go from home, not even to church, dine constantly in rhy dressing-room, and ani attended only by the houSe-maid—If this conduct cannot Secure rhe from cehfure, t must confeSs mySelf utterly at a loSs ia what relpedt to correct it.
Yet upon the whole I am much hap-, pier than I could have expeded-—and am, properly lenfible of the indulgence of Patty’s continuance; I should be completely wretched if she was torn from me.
She is really grown finely, and is now
entered into her fifteenth year--Will
not

not Mr. Mulgfpve, think you, have shme fchenie advancement for her
beSore many months have elapSed___-But
however repugnant his choice to her inclination, she has at worst the happinefs of an unengaged heart—What would become of me on Such a contingence I will not however anticipate afflidiions-
for either her or mySelf---To^ lofe her
would be an inlupportaBIe stroke under
my circumstances; and to be bestowed
after the example of her lister, a heavy calamity to her nice Senfib ility-—May,
heaven avert both the one and the other for a long period!
What importance we are apt to give thoSe oBjeOis we Behold with, approbation ?—First r was to run away with your Sir Edward, and now the little undeSign-ing Patty is to be cautioned against becoming your rival—But if the inequality of their years is your only Security, I
need not point out how inadequate a one
'—^Would she heSitate, we will SuppoSe, at eighteen to accept an agreeable baronet of eight and twenty; when her fister at that blooming juncture was united to venerable threefcore—I can nevertheless

Sir Edward is certainly your own— Why, as you obServe, should he Ib Soon reviSit you, if he had no particular incitement—and I must very loon find my Harley in the perSon oS lady Selwyn.
I am reSolved to make the best of my disappointments—Harry once Satisfied with his Sate—you, rny dear girl, happily dilpoled of, and Patty exempt from arbitrary persecution, I shall be rich in ■ fatisfadtions—and may perhaps at fome future period, be restored by an unforeseen turn, at least to the tranSient parti-

MtPs Harley to Lady Hindley.
ALAS! my lovely Sriend, your prophetic pretenSions are utterly gioiindlefs Sir Edward— —»but you shall
have the particulars and judge Sor your-SelS,
V
We had a little party yesterday—my father, mother, Mr, Selwyn, (the gentleman that conducted Sir Edward to our village when a School-boy) and the
worthy old parlbii his tutor, occupied the coach, whilst the too charming Baronet and your Harley took up their fitting in an elegant little chaiSe—the most convenient oS all fituations for private chat.
There was Ibmething I could perceive strongly labouring in his breast—He attempted once or twice to give it vent, (and fool that I was from vainly conceiving I had an interest in his distreSs) Smiled encouragement upon him, and should have rendered mySelf completely ridiculous,

lous, had he not been too much engrost-Sed by the important purpoSe he had in view, to honour me with a moment’s attention.	.
A-t length—I have, my dear MiSs Harley, Said he, the highest opinion both of your understanding and good-nature— To relieve a Suffering heart cannot there-Sore be an unpleaSing exerciSe Sor either the one or the other—It is in your pow-er—
My power, Sir Edward .?—What can be in my power So essential to your Selici-ty Our long acquaintance might render you more assured-—Sir Edward Selwyn cannot make, a request, that I ought not to comply with.
This was pretty well, you will Say, on my part—my cheek, -all mantling witli conSuSion, bears honest testimony to your observation.
ASter a short paufe, you are yourSel^ ray dear madam, returned he, (reSpeCt-Sully taking my hand) on every occaSion —I apprehended your delicacy might be alarmed—Circumstances are tender, but

I beg, Sir, you would jjot waste the time in apologies (a good hint again) that if properly employed would procure you the Satisfaction you Seem So niuclx to de-Sire—I will not deceive yoU'—
Generous MiSs Harley, bu- you must alSo pardon me,, or your goooneSs will be incompleat.
I was upon the aOual verge of making a. reply that would have beti -ycd me to his everlasting deriston and contempt;, when he reSumed, tho’ rather timidly.
Our Harry, my dear madam, is most inevitably excluded from the wish of his heart—but give me leave to alk you. what would forbid my looking up to lady Hindley with hope, if her lord: was but once out of the way
Sir, lady Hindley; cried I.—•
Yes, madam;. I lee my fears were too well grounded, but she is the only woman to whom I was ever tenderly attached, _^and is the only woman that could addi a charm to my life, or diSpel the discontent that preys upon my Soul.
Lady Hindley is truly amiable. Said I, (but tho’ I think you So, my dear, I had a farther motive at that instant for proclaiming
letter XXX. 165
claiming it than merely doing justice to your merit—It was a mean artifice to cover my unworthy chagrin.
O most truly amiable, returned he; Lord Hindley cannot live Sor ever, and in the courSe of nature she will be the Survivor—^What would twice feven years of anxious expedlation be, in compariibn with Such an acquisition as her hand, if there was but the most distant proiped: of obtaining it. You are well acquainted
with your friend’s Sentiments-and I
must conSeSs to you, I have troubled you with this viSit in order to Solicit your kind information in one Single article. Has she, my good MiSs Harley, any peculiar diflike to me }—^Is there any part of my conduct or appearance that I could redlify to her taste ?—Only teach me the blessed art of recommending mySelf to her favour, and my best gratitude shall be yours.
This was a most delightSul Setting off, and could not Sail to render the excurlion wonderfully agreeable to me—notwithstanding which, I Supported the mortifying disappointment my vanity had expoS-cd me to with amazing fortitude, and
assured

assured him, he might not only depend upon my good wishes, but endeavours to ferve him iS ever in my power—A pro-
mile I will most religioufiy perSorm--
For next to being ablblutely beloved, is the certainty of being esteemed by the man of our choice.
And yet that I may entitle mySelf to the cenSure I deServe, I will own to you I should be lest affedted at knowing him destined to the little Patty than yourSelS—• I can bear a rival however extraordinary in my love—but our Sriendship will admit of no competitor.
Yet whilst I was thrown at a distance by the uncle, it was evident the nephew
beheld me with partiality---In short, it
w^as a day of persecution ; for my ear was hurt by one, my heart by the other—and retirement was all I wished for to relieve—
Yet I am proud of the compliment Sir Edward pays me—Any fool might have admired rny perSon, any knave might have been captivated by my fortune— but to have discovered the requiSites in my composition, that conciliate the tender friend, the judicious adviSer, and the
compassionate
LETTER XXX. 167
compassionate advocate is a flattery of the Sublimest Species, and shall be duly estimated by rhe.
Now that this grai?d point is gained-^ that I have engaged my interest, and rather cherished than checked his hopes, he very compoSedly propoSes returning from whence he came—Be it So—-I will not be Sound unworthy his good opinion, or unequal to mySelf.
Adieu, my Eliza---That one man ^
for your Sake should have been tempted to tranSgreSs the laws of humanity, a Second become a voluntary exile, or a third renounce the whole Sex Srom the precarious wish of one day being united to you, is in no degree astonishing to her that considers her as the first and most valuable of females, the dearest and most precious of friends.

Lady Hindley to Mifs Harley.
« '
SO you have had fine doings, my dear, at the village-^-—Innocence, Simplicity, and honest shame, have, I Sear, fled the once Savoured lf)ot never more to revifit it.	'
How can Sir Edward Selwyn have the -confidence to proSeSs (or you So little delicacy as to be capable oS listening to) his views on the wiSe oS another—VVas I at liberty this instant and dilpoled to make a choice, and had sto other objedUon to him than this glaring breach oSpropriety, be assured, he is not the man. But you know my lentiments both with relpedl to him and Second marriages in the general, thereSorc should not have added in the Smallest degree to my dilfatisSadfion.
This is one oS the many mortifications that attend unSuitable unions—But my particular caSe ought above all others tc have lecured me Srom the indignity of
being

being beSpoke—I neither changed my condition for a title, or what is quite as iiSual, in order to shake off parental authority-—but tho’ bartered for, I will remember I have been a wiSe, nor put it in the power oS an unrefined world to be witty at my expence.
Lord Hind ley has had a Severe attack of the gout ;■ Patty and I were as assiduous to divert and relieve his Sufferings as iS he had been adually dear to us—But we did not meet with altogether So grateful a return as w e might have expected— He has Sound out I am too Sond of her, and complains bitterly that my affedion is all lavished on others, whilst he languishes in vain Sor the Smallest share oS it.
What can I do to make him eaSy ?— Such is his extraordinary turn oS mind, that if I was capable of adding the Sacrifice oS my Sincerity to what he has already obtained, it would have no better effed than expoSing me in the first fit of phren-zy or impatience to a new Species 'oS in-
Sult.

ijo LETTER XXXI.
To See an old emaciated being, tottering on the very verge of eternity, yet panting aSter youthSul acquisitions, is exceeding dreadful---yet every inter-
val oS eaSe his Lordship enjoys is devoted to trifles--the purchaSe or al-
teration of a gay Suit of clothes, elegant pair of ruffles, or a renewal of his claim to livelinels and vivacity. Without a friend he can confide in, a creature whoSe attachment might chear his drooping Spirits, or, I fear, one worthy mental conSolation, does he struggle with diSeaSe, and labour to render even his shfferings uopitiable.
He has been writing great part of this afternoon, but I never give him the con-fequence with me to inquire into his affairs, or would alka favmurat his hands in the most trying exigence.
On Some occafions I have the honour of being a deity with him, then am Sunk to an errant driveller—That he would but be uniSorm, tho’ in morostneSs, it would be leSs in Supportable than the shd-den changes he is stibjeO; to—Yet if your correspondence had not Sailed me in point

From the Same to the Same.
All my resolution, my Harley, is
beginning to SorSake me—this Lord —how indeSatigable he proves himSelS in destroying the peace oS her whom he proSeffes to love.
Patty is to be conveyed Srom the Grove, on the mean Supposition that she is the impediment to his willies—Sent back to a houSe that So ill protedted her Sister ; and a Sather that will think himSelS entitled by his Single authority to diSpoSe oSher without considering aught but his own convenience.
There is no doubt but my affedlions must be conciliated by So endearing an action—I am exaSperated beyond all endurance, at Such repeated and cruel absurdities—my heart bleeds aSresh—every calamity Seems again to rear its head, and I must at last fink under the Sad complication.

I absolutely wish she could, sty to shelter herSelSfrom all the consequential evils of her change oS Situation—But it cannot be ; the poor child is Sriendlest and unknown ; and must, like me, abide the mifery of her deSencelels state.
Was I not born in an unlucky hour,, thus to ruin every one that loves me .?— Harry—as you obServe, I think by way of compliment—Harry has been incited to banish himSelf; do I not by the most perverSe Salcination, stand between you and happineSs ^ And is not this inoffend-ing Patty irreparably undone .?
The only thing leSt with me will be our correspondence ; and that, in all probability, will too Soon Sollow the rest— We ought to be prepared, however, and render our letters as unintelligible as possible ; nor will I longer delay the Security

tears, to restore her to me beSore this time to-morrow.
But what dependance could I possibly have on Such a shuttlecock—Nay, in all probability, the next whim would be even more inSupportable than the present ; I thereSore declined listening to him on the SubjeD, and I Sancy he will giv^e up all thoughts of recalling her.

IT is very true, my dear Harley—I am, as I inSormed you, cloSely confined at Mr. MuSgrove’s.
It stems, the moment Lord Hindley became acquainted with Patty’s intended elopement, he threw himstlS into agonies that were little inferior to the utmost violence, nor were they in any decree abated on his arrival at the Grove. ^
I fled to my cloSet Sor shelter—but he purSued me thither with reproaches and inSults of the grossest and most aggravating nature.
‘ I had a private communication with
his unnatural stn ; and he had no doubt
but the next attempt would be either on
his liSe, or what was still dearer to him, my perSon.’
I Smiled contemptuoussy upon him— and disdained to open my mouth; tho’
I 2	the
iq6 letter XXXIX.
she conSutation of all his abSurdities had depended upon that fingle acfiion.
‘ I thought he would have beat me—• It is thus. Said he, that my Sufferings, my injuries, are ever the Iport of her that ought to relieve them—Why did nature lavish Such abundant gifts on your out-Side, and leave the internal part utterly devoid of perfedion ?—You have noshing of the woman in your whole mental composition—neither credulity, vanity, SoStneSs, nor compassion-—you can behold me tortured to the last extremity—diS-traded, and beyond all defcription
wretched—without one pitying Sigh---
Yet I continue to adore you in Spite of my realbn, pride, and strong incitements to the contrary.’

IT is an account of Lord Hindley’s illneSs, my dear madam, my Sister

take leave to make my Self of So much conSequence, as to give you- Some particulars relative to my affairs.
You cannot but recollect the distressed circumstances under which I wrote my last letter to you. What the conversation was between Lord Hindley and my lister, on his return with me to the Grove, I am still ignorant, but the reSult was, that she was hurried av/ay beSore my eyes, without my being permitted to Speak one adieu; and So Soon as another carriage could be got ready, I was informed by the ill-natured looking houSe-keeper, that
she

she was to attend me to a ladies board-ing-School at Bologne.
You may be Sure, madam, I was greatly afflided at this news—but it was in vain to reSist, and we reached Dover that very evening. I Sound, however, that we were to proceed no Sarther without a letter Srom his lordship, or my Sather, and was beginning to flatter my-SelS, when a man arrived and determined the whole affair at once—In a w'ord, all miserable as I was, I was compelled to embark, remained Sor a whole month in no better nor v/orSe place than an adual nunnery.

pleaSed to give me only a very cool reception ; lectured, examined me, but I held Sast to my integrity, and I was sternly commanded by my Sather to prepare mySelS to make atonement for my breach oS duty. I would give all the world, my dear madam, to know what they had in their heads—but to my great mortification. Lord Hindley^s illneSs prevented their dilcloSing their dessgns, and doubt and apprehenSion are still my portion.
My Sather, you must know, never intended that 1 should have the pleaSure, the happineSs oS being restored to my dear lister, nor would he even have let her know I was in the houSe—iS his lordship in a happy fit (I must call it) oS penitence, had not inli'sted that I should be produced ; and he v/ill not admit of the Slightest contradiction.
But lord bleSs me! how wide have I run Srom the point—yet will you not excuSe me, as I really meant to oblige, instead of wearying you—I may be vain ; but Such is the opinion I entertain of your goodnels, tnat I cannot perfuade mySelf you are indifferent to what concerns the

What was the wanton declaration I made in a Sormer epistle, when the meteor hope was dancing beSore my deluded eyes—that I should find but little difficulty

ladyship to Patty---it was a baSe, a
punishable Salshood ; Patty, all lovely, accomplished, and attracting, is not my Eliza; nor is it more natural to me to breathe, than to breathe only Sor her.
And yet, my boy, I am Ib cloSely attacked on all Sides, that I know not how to deSend mySelS—Harry hinges all his Selicity on this unthought of union— Lady Hindley declares it to me her earnest deSire; Mrs. MuSgrove tacitly entreats me to lave the worthy girl from all future persecution ; and MuSgrove, either from a principle of Self-interest, or shame, or both, is to the last degree Iblicitous in promoting the univerSal wish.

Mufgrove’s top-Sails are amazingly lowered, occaSioned, as he tells the story, by the dying behaviour of his friend— I would not be ill-natured or uncharitable, but, if I remember right, he rather antedates his reformation—the deprivation of power will work a more wonderful change in a mean Ibul, than any other circumstance—yet we will not examine him too minutely, but accept his Services and concessions, and leave his Sincerity to be questioned or evinced, by the permanence of his good behaviour.

Every thing is Settled—Lady Hindley will take up her ressdence under your -happy rooS—his lordship is to be your friend’s guest, and the lovely Patty his dearest companion. Thus will the whole be wound up—yet all is not So well with me as I could wish—I cannot write,
