For Providence, in its wife Difpofition of Sublunary Circumftances, has created no Nonpareil; and however extravagant, and feemingly alone, a Perfon of your Charader and Merit may appear, ’tis without Scruple affirmed, (by

there are within the Bills of Mortality Two thou-fand three hundred and feventy nine, who differ very little from your illu-jflrious Self; infomuch that ’twill be impoflible to do Juftice to your Merit, without at the fame time alarming that Number with a natural and juft De-fcription of thofe amiable Qualities and Perfedions they fo happily poffefs.

From Perfons in thole Circumfiances, ’tis nati ral to exped; an inexhauflible Fund of Satyr, whi( could not want Occafion of exerting it felf a Scene, where the Pleafure and Indolence appare in the Countenances of all around ’em, afforded t' grating and harfh- Refiedion of having been, and b ing now no more, the blooming Objeds of fuch Tiiodiih, and fiiperficial Adoration, which howev defpicable in its felf, and in the Opinion of t wifer Part of that Sex, is what {as a Right a> Time immermrial their Dm) they can’t- fubmit

He had already Love and Impatience enough to ex-prefs much DilTatisfadion and Uneafinefs at the Prof-ped of having his approaching Happinefs adjourn’d for fo long a Time as might be fuppos’d to determine Phillis's Stay in the Country : He wonder’d how a Perfon fo doatingly fond of him, could have fo muchAbftinence as to entertain any Thoughts of a Diverfion which piuft fo' necelTarily retard the amorous Congrels.
’Tisealy to guefshow tickling the Pleafure was that pofTefs’d the envious ^uthrefs of his Epiftles, when he fo loudly prais’d the inimitable Stile and Spirit with which they were wrote. Flattery is fo bewitching, that ’twas next to impoffible to conceal the Pleafiire that refulted from it, even tho’ it came from him ; and ’twas very vifible to thofo whom fhe would divert with a Detail of her Amufoment, that her taking all Opporunities of depreciating the Merit of her Performance, and ridiculing thole Billets
Ihe had wrote, tended manifeftly to point out thofe Beauties and Graces which are interlpers’d, and are
pretty vifible to thole who have perus’d ’em ; but in
a more particular Aianner to herfelf.

But to return to our Love-Creditor. Flis Stupidity and Want of Penetration was a proper Object: for the Envy as well as the Diverfion of his AlTo-ciates. Ye Gods ! What ravilhins; and extatick

Many and great were his Squabbles with his fage Confidante^ as well ss others of his Acquaintance, who in vain attempted to convince him, that all this ro-mantick Proceeding was calculated only to expole him.

Phillis’s being a Widowi added, in his Opinionj' very much to her Charms; no jealous Husband, or Bravo Brother was now to be fear’d, who might interrupt his impending Toy by an unfeafonable Demand of Reparation for deluded Innocence, or violated Vertue : Cupid and Alars are feldom in Pofref-' lion of the fame Breaft; the little blinking God is apt to infpire his Votaries with a more than ordinary" Averfion for pointed Steel ; and Reafbn good, for hard would be that Mortal’s Cafe, whofe Heart and Lungs fhould be both transfix’d But it has been whifper’d, that our enamour’d Hero was not entirely indebted to his Paffion, but had naturally an unalterable Affeftion for a whole Skin, tho’ when fo »ood

She fpoke the very Sentiments of his Soul, wh( ihe feem’d to wifh for a Method of correfponding *twas what {next to feeing her) he moft wilh’d foi the Elegance of his Stile, he did not doubt, wOu fecond his lovely Superficies, and eftablifh his Coi queft. Often, during this Chicane,did he write whc Reams full of Profellions of eternal Love and Coi flancy, and fhew ’em to his Confidante, People her Caft of Mind are feldom very free of Comp ments, and fhe was very diligent in pointing o what was ridiculous and abfurd in thofe CompoJ tionsj but that he had Addrefs enough to impute her Ignorance and illTafte. She has likewile, < exprefling a feign’d Diftafte at fome Expreflions fome of her own Letters to him, had the Satisfadk of being convinc’d, that fhe had not a Soul elevan enough to difcover the Beauties that breath’d in ev ry Line which Phillis wrote.
’Twas happy for him that he had admitted to 1 Confidence one lb capable as Urganda was of dive

A long Interval now enfu’d, in which he receiv’d no more Billets from Phillis; whether the old Lady who favour’d him with the reft was otherwife engaged, or thought him {as he really was) an Objed unworthy to beftow fo much Labour on, is uncertain. It’s probable ftie had refolved to put a Period to her Chicane, and give the Lover a Refpite from his bewilder*d and blind Purfuit, when the fame ill
Fortune that firft threw him in her Way, prompted him, (when he now receiv’d no more Billets from
Phillis) to affirm, and with a Thoufand Oaths and
Imprecations aflert, that his ador’d Charmer had
at laft blefs’d him with the PolTcffion of her Perfon,
and had already fix’d on a private Part of the Town
moft commodioufly adapted for the amorous Rendez.~ vous; to thele folemn Lies he would add fuch a De-

title him to the Envy of all Mankind.

*Twas above Meafure diverting, to fee the Concern and Uneafinefs he was under at the fuppos’d Sick-nefs of his kind Vnknown; he had no other Method of re-admitting his old Friend into his Confidence, but by retra(fi:ing all he had told her in relation to his pofTefling of Phillis; her Advice and Affiftance he thought too valuable, not to be purchas’d by fo
trifling a Sacrifice as that of his Feracity.
It was a Scene eafier imagin’d than exprefs’d, to
have feen with how contrite a Face he mufi; inform her, that all he had been boafting of was but meer Invention, and LieSy and with how much ill Nature ihe cenfur’d his Behaviour. This Scene of Hypo-crify was carried on fb far, that Ihe in good Earnefl perfwaded him, that this Sicknefs of Phillis was a Pu-
nifhment from Heaven for his monftrous Lies.

How often did fhe rate him for fo black an Inftance of Ingratitude, as that of fo ungeneroufly facrificing the Honour and Reputation of one to whom he was fo much obliged ? Our Penitent fincerely refolv’d to do fo no more; and if his kind Stars would refiore his charming Vnh^own to Health and him, prornis’d that nothing on his Part for the future fhould hazard her Health or Repofe.
’Tis pleafant to obferve, how meer a Piece of Me-chanifm humane Nature is, and how eafily wrought on; for behold here a Lover to all Intents and Purpo-fes, made fb by mere Dint of Art and Dexterity ; and ’twill increafe his Wonder, if the Reader be inform’d, that Vrganda was not Mechanick good enough ever ^:q have equipp’d with the Tramels of Love any other

How precarious is humane Felicity ! No Joy y^ithout Alloy ; how hard was Philandefs Fate, who could not enjoy the Refleftion of being now in the fame Town with his dear Incognita, and con (equent-ly much nearer the happy Moment of an Eclaircijfe-menti without the Perplexity of refleding that Two of his Letters had mifcarried ; this furnifh’d him with difmal Apprehenfions, left they ftiould have fallen into the Hands of his Relations, from whom many Reafons made it necelTary to conceal any amorous Engagement.
It muft be acknowledg’d to be a refin’d Coup
d*Eclat of Urganda's^ thus to mention two Letters more than Ihe had wrote, or he receiv’d; it had its intended Effed, and afforded much Pleafure to ob^ ferve, with what Caution and Art he direded an un^*

But Time wore put the Uneafinefs he fuffer’d upon that Account, and gave him an Opportunity of exprefling his Joy at Phillis’s Recovery and Arrival in Town, which he did in a moft moving and fignificant Manner; for, ’tis faid he made a coftly Collation to entertain his Confidatfte and her AlTociatee

No fooner faid but done ; the Cane immediately receiv’d its Blue Ornament, and confefs’d the Ma-r fler’s Flame ; for Philander would as fbon have employed it to break Heads as Hearts; he had too much good Nature, too little Gall, to permit it to be fo

Eftablilhed in this Conje<5ture, he follow’d her, and omitted no Opportunity of difplaying a Thoufand impertinent Aires, and confirming her in the Opinion which moft who had taken Notice of him that Day had entertained, viz^» That he was befide himfelf ; his Behaviour and all his Geftures could import no lefs ,* his importunate Familiarities at laft compell’d her to take Refuge in a Friend’s Floufe, and leave him to fuftain the Scoffs and Gibes of a gaping Mob. But what o’ that ? Many and more fevere than thofe are the Combats and Difafters that every Knight^Errant meets with in the Purfuit of Miftrefles, perhaps as chimerical as Phillis,
But Nothing would beat our Hero out of his Love and Refolution to perlift, in Obedience to his Nymph’s Commands ,* and for a firmer Adherence to the Letter of her Injundion, he next Day affixed to his Cane a Ribbon of a deeper Hue, true Blue, an Emblem of Conftancy. I'hus every Day equipped, he omitted no Opportunity of publifhing his Obedience to his Vnknown-, till his Folly became as confpicuous as his Cane-String; efpecially when he declar’d his Refblve to perfift in wearing it till Phillis blefs’d him with an Interview, which in all Probability muft be foon, after he had given fb flagrant a Proof of his Love and Conftancy.

The Time appointed for the Meeting was elapfe before this reach’d his Hands, which aflPeded hii with the moft fenfible Remorfe and Defpair j a Di appointment like this was too great to be borne wii any tolerable Share of Patience; that after fuch a t dious Courfe of Expedation, his evil Genius Hiou hurry him out of the Way juft at the CriJiso£\ Happinefs; that he who had always fucceeded in I: Attempts on the Fair, ftiould have his Hopes thi fruftrated by damn’d ill Fortune; Nothingelfe, 1 fwore, could be any Obftacle to his Progreft in ar Amour; for he, ’twas well known, never had fail
to infpire with the warmeft Defires all whom he h; condefcended to invite to his amorous Banquet. Bi
this is the Cuftom of that inconftant fickle Baggag the worthy and moft amiable Part of the Creation a her Averfion, and often, too often, feel the fatal E fedls of her Frowns and Difpleafure.
A fatal Inftance did Philauder think himlelf of tl:
her ill-tim’d Rancour; he could have no Acquai:
tance with his Phillis’s Humour, nor how ftie mig
be prefum’d to refent her Difappointment, but h
heard that the moft violent Hatred fucceeds the me
ardent Love, when neglected, and that Hell does n^
contain a Fury like a Woman fcorn’d. ’Twas re
Ibnable to fuppofe, that a Woman of her fine Sen
would be very poignant, and that it might be fuppos
Ihe could not want Inftruments to execute the Dr
tates of her Revenge. Thefe Surmifes, however r
mote, are the natural Refult of an habitual and una
terable Paftion for Safety, which Philander from h
Youl
Youth up had moft religioufly entertain’d, arid was incori)orated into his very Being ,• thefe Impreffions were indelible, and not to be obliteratedi no,' not by Love it felf.
Dreadful might have been rhe Conlequences of his dwelling perpetually upon thefe, and llich like melanchoUy and tremendous Reflexions, had not a good-natur’d and fincere Friend footh’d his troubled and unquiet Mindj by reprefenting, that the good Senfe that Phillis by her Letters moft evidently ap-pear’d to be endow’d with, could not but prompt her to ftilpeXi that other Gaufes befides NegleX or Indifference^ might occafion his not appearing at the Place of Rendez/vous : She muft, without Doubts know full well, that innumerable Accidents are infe-ptrable from humane Affairs, Sicknefs, Miftarriage of a Letter, or, what was now the Caufe, an acci-* dental Avocation, are Incidents as common as una-* voidable.
Sooth’d with the pleafing Hopes of her putting the true ConftruXion on his Abfence, he began to recover, in fome Meafure, his ufual State of Eafe and Tranquility, and vifited his Confidante^ in Order to impart to her the terrible Source of his Chagrin^’ in Hopes that fhe likewife would fpeak Comfort to him,- and confirm him in the Hopes he had flatter’d himfelf with, of being ftill happy in the Poffefliott of his fair Vnk^owni But alas! that was the wrong Quarter to expeX Redrefs from; fhe had long fince iefolv’d to lofe no Occafion of exerting her ill NaK fifre# and grately told him, fhe, as a Woman, wa$

by far the propeter Judge how a Woman would lent fuch a Difappointment ,* flie, for her Part, (j Phillis Ihe could not but think had as much Spi and as elevated a Soul) would as fbon cut off her H; as employ it in Writing to a Man, who Ihe had much Realbn to think unworthy her AlFe(51:ions; Ihe’d tear the fond Paflion from her Heart, and | fecute with eternal Vengeance the hated Objed her Refentment.

She indeed began now to think the Fatigue of Impertinence too great a Purchafe for her Diverf and would have been glad of this Opportunity drop the Correfpondence, had not feveral whom had from Time to Time diverted with Accounts her Progrefs in it, prevailed on her to profecute it After Ihe had fiifficiently fretted him with a !

What Heart of Flint but muft o’erflo'' with Tendernefs, to refleft on being the Occafic of lb much Chagrin to the only Perfon in the Wof worthy of his Care ? He was firmly convinced ( the Juftice of her Claim to his Love and Conftanc and folemnly refolv’d to her to devote ’em.
From thence he went, in Purfuance of his Pr mife, to the Apartment of his Confidantey to who he fliew’d the Billet he had been blefs’d with t IHight before, together with a Copy of that, he h wrote in Anfwer to it, and left underneath t^ Bench ,* and befides the Encomiums he beftow’d up( her’s, his Task was now doubled, and he had full much to lay in Praife of that he wrote in Anfwer it. Nothing furely but the immediate Influence the little God himfelf could infpire him wi
> Thoughts and Expreflions lb moving, lb pathetic lb appofite.
One ought to be poflefs’d with as much ill Nati as file was, to recount the various Faults fhe four and Criticifms fhe made on the Letter he had wrote Anfwer to Phillis's: The fagacious Reader w without Doubt, eafily point out thofe Parts of which are moft liable to Exception, and at the fa] Time candidly impute ’em to the Violence of Love, which had intoxicated his Brain : Perhap Perform as far gone in that Paflion as Philander^ mi^ |in4 as g*^acef^l Beautifs in Stile §nd Co;
pofiti
pofition of it as he himfelf did; for it is univerfally allow’d, that the powerful Influences of Love caule a wonderful Revolution throughout the whole humane Syftem, and ’tis not ftrange to find in a Perfon agitated by the fl:upendious Effeds of it, that Wit and Folly, Senfe and Nonlenfe, change their Places, and are promifcuoufly blended ,* whether we, the ftu-pid Infenfibles, or they, whole Spirits are thus elevated by the little infinuating God, judge mofl: conformable to Truth, mufl: remain a Secret till the lafl: general Bonfire.
As fbon as his Confidante had it confirm’d from his own Mouth, that he had thus thruft the Didates of his enamour’d Heart into the deftin’d Crevice, a Do^ meftick Pacolet was immediately difpatch’d to explore
that intricate Magazine of Love, who fuccefsfully rumag’d, and as faithfully return-d with that elegant Epiftle which juft now entertain’d the courteous Reader, and fhe had the Satisfadion of finding, that her hide-and-feek Lover had not difguis’d a Syllable, but had been exadly pundual in communicating the whole Contexture of it.
The next Day he himfelf return’d, and finding his Letter gone, without Hefitation concluded, it had reach’d the fair Hand of his kind Unknown; a Perfon in his Senfes would fcarce have imagin’d other-wife, and how fhouldit be expeded from him ? For who elfe could be fuppos’d to fearch for a Letter there befides the Perfon who direded his leaving one ? Nobody could, or did, that’s moft certain.

*Tis uncertain whether his Pleafure or Uneafinels was the greateft at the Receipt of this, for he hadi been fo perpetually harangu’d with the innumerable Faults and Abfurdities which Vrganda was perpetu. ally pointing out in the Letter he had left under the Bench, that he began to rejoyce it had not reach’d his Phillis's Hand, and prudently refolv’d to profit by his very Difappointments, took this Opportunity
of affuring his Confidante, that the Letter he fliew’d her, and pretended to have wrote to his Vnknoivn, was merely to amufe and impofe on her ,* Purely ftie could not in earneft think him capable of writing fuch a Heap of Nonfence, with an Intent of fending it to a Perfon he valu’d.
r
This Deceit added to his Folly, firengthened his Title to her Refentment, and without doubt invigorated her Refblution to continue her Diverfion at his Expence ; fhe cou’d fcarce contain her Spleen and Patience, formally to tax him with Want of Sincerity, and the Ingratitude he had been guilty of, in fb meanly im-pofing upon one who was always fo ready to inter-

c T Think I have now effedually fecured my { J. ‘ againft any future Difappointment, pro^

*	Mill, is a narrow Lane, at the Left Hand is « Gate that leads into a Meadow that is very full ‘ Chalk-Stones, at the Infide of that Gate, at t ‘ Side of the Tree which is next to the Hinges ‘ the Gate, I have buried a Horn Box with a Pi(
/
‘ of Paper in it, and cover’d the Place with Cha' ‘ Stones; if you pleafe to take that away, and in t
<	Box put a Letter for me ,• I lhall go to t
*	bridge again next Week, and as I have done no 5 pretend to be fick, and flop my Coach arid take
*	away. This perhaps. Sir, may look a little roms
<	tick and troublefome, but depend upon being fi
*	ficiently recompenced, asfoon as I am conviri( « by your Letter that you are equally defirous of i:
*	Acquaintance. Let me know your Leifure Da]
<	and I’ll not fail giving you a Meeting, for I <
<	almoft diftraded at the many Dilappointments , < have already met with. I hope this Method v

CHILLIS*
A Si ‘The Box is wrapt in white Paper, Don’t « fail me of a Letter, tho’ it be to tell me, you hate
*	and defpife me. If that be my hard Lot, I’ll ‘ ceafe to trouble you more, tho’ I eternally plague
*	myfelf.
As loon as this came to his Hand, he thought he Could not be too expeditious in obeying the Contents of it j nay, he had been provident enough to have! wrote a long Letter before he had received the Di-regions for the Conveyance of it, fo that it was Ibonfinilhed and copied fair; and ^s foon as it was thus equipp’d for killing the fair Unknown’s Hand of his PhilliSi he poftpon’d all his other AjBFairs, to be vacant and at Leifure for a Tourney to the Chalk-Meadow. To compleat the Farce, this Place was more than Twelve Miles from Town, and ’twas more to lave her own Labour in fetching his Letters from ' thence, than his in leaving ’em there, that Vrganda did not fend him thrice as far; there’s little Reafon to doubt his Obedience, to what Place foever he had
been fent bn fuch on Errand.
•	*	>
Early	next	Morning	he	mounts	his	Horfe,	and
I
hies away in Search of the Horn Box, and to his in-expreffible Satisfaftion, in left than Six flours, he had the marvellous good Fortune to find the Place, and the very Box ; it’s prefumed, no Inftance can be found in a Chriftian Country, fince the Warfare of Don Quixote de la Manchuy of immortal merry Memory,	that a Windmill,	a	Bridge;	a	buried	Box;
E	and
and a hollow Tree, ever encounter’d each other in tl fame Place.
He could not but miftruft, by the estraordinai Situation of the Place> and the Oddnefs of the A fair, that Witchcraft and Enchantment muft neceffai ly be employ’djand did with muchPleafure refledijtl the very Devils had confpir’d with the reft of t Creation, to make him compleatly happy.
After having kifs’d the Box that had been tli happily employ’d by his dear Vnknowny he devout entrufts it with the foft Didates of his Heart, t dear Excrements of his Brain; and no Cat ever to^ more Care fo give a decent Interment to the odori: rous Superfluities of her Podex, than did our Loi to cover and conceal from vulgar Hands and Eyes t Overflowings of his Wit and amorous Ingenuit After having carefully look’d around him, to be cc vinc’d that no prying Eye had difcover’d him maki thus a Sacrifice to the Cods of the Earth, he : mounted his Nag, and jocundly rode Home, abc Meafure pleas’d and fatisfy’d with a Thoufand ravii ing and diverting Refveries that refulted from bis IVl trefs’s Commands, and his Obedience.
Th is gave him frefti Occafion to extol to his Q fidante the refin’d Wit, and more than humane C( trivance of his Angelick^ Incognita : Nothing but i moft ardent Paflion could infpire her with fo mi Ingenuity ; a Place like that feem’d by Nature ( fign’d for extraordinary Scenes and Events; fo
little trivial Circumftance in the Situation of i
Pla
Pkce, was what perpetually occupied his Imagina* tion; Nothing elle, (at leaft for Ibme Days) employ’d his Thoughts and Tongue, and he was without Ceafe harrafling his Confidante with repeated De-fcriptions of it. A Pot of Gold would not more effectually have cheat’d the Heart of the moft penurious Mifer, than his Was with the Horn Box.
The next Day, Vrganda^ with Mr. Noedig, vifi-ted the Tree, and loon rak’d up the Box, in which they found Philander’s fecond Epiftle, and had the Pleafure of obferving how exactly nice he had been in fhunning thofe Faults flie had upbraided him with in the former; but w'’hether he did not in this afford a larger Field for Criticifm, the Reader will beft j udge when he has perus’d it; which is as follows.

It did not lay long there before Vrganda feiz’d it a
a Tribute due t© her refin'd Invention. ’Tis hard r<
fay whether he or fhe took moll Pleafure in thele mac

But what was now to be done ? ’T would be car* tying the Jeft a great deal too far, befides giving the Laugh out of her own Hand, to have fent the Thou^ fand Pounds he had fo gracioufly lignified his Acceptance of I file was loth to do that, and equally loth to forego the Diverfion flie promifed herfelf by prole** curing this AlFair a little farther. She very prudently confider’d, that in real Intrigues, Nothing contributes to keep up the Spirit and Vigour of the Paf-fion more than a well-tifn’d Quarrel, and that the Fair one’s Wit and Smartnels never appears more to Advantage, than in the genteel and tart Re£le(3:ions didated by a pregnant Refentment. But while the
Lover was all Submiffion and Obedience, *twill be
\
hard to pick out any Circumftance whereon to ground her Indignation ; no Matter forthatj a fiditious Quarrel may very properly owe its Birth to a fidi* tious Caufe, and ’twas very eafy, ("while there was the leaft Probability of the Mifcarriage of a Letter) to deny the Receipt of this laR and the Negled of an-fwering a Billet fo wonderfully obliging as her’s was, eou’d not but be fuppos’d to give arnple Occafion for her Anger.

Q T Have been Ib happy as to find your Letter, but ‘ am very, much alarm’d at not finding my ‘ own, not knowing what Conflrudion to put
<	upon a Refufal of that Nature, unleJfs it be with an
*	Intent to expofe me. I dare challenge you to pro-‘ duce a Prefident of a Man of Honour’s not com-‘ plying immediately with fuch a Demand. ’Tis

P.
P. S, ‘ I fhaD go to Vxhridge before I depart the * Kingdom, and fliall call at the Tree for my Letters: ^ Perhaps on fecond Thoughts you may fee your felf ‘ in the Wrong, if not, I muft fall a Sacrifice to ‘ your pretended Honour, and curfe my Folly. You ‘ defire me to meet you in a Mask j how can you ‘ think me fo eafily impos’d on, as to have Honour ‘ in one Part, and not in another ? No, Sir, Ho-‘ nour is a Perfection of fo nice a Nature, that its
< Votaries are incapable (on the moft trivial Occafion) t of acting contrary to its Dictates.
Alas ! too cruel and inhumane Fair ! is Nothing of Force enough to divert you from your barbarous Refolves ? Can’t you be content with denying Phi-^ Under the View of your Mask, without adding to his Misfortunes the Lofs of your dear Scrawls ? Thus did the unhappy Swain argue, and in the moft moving Strains, deplore that fatal Hour and Accident that had drawn down the Difpleafure of his ador’d Vnhnown, In vain did he endeavour to prevail with himfelf to part with thofe dear Inftruments of Love, and in vain attempt to dare to difobey; fatal might have been the Confequence of fuch a Procedure; one fo foon provoked as flie was, and that without any certain Proof of an Offence, would without doubt be inexorable on fuch a bare-fac’d
r
Contempt of her Command.
lv\ this Dilemma he was ftrongly induc’d to return the Letters, on Confideration of her having declar’d} that Nothing deterr’d her from giving him an
F 4	Inter-*
»
Interview but her Sufpicion of his Honour, which he could not but imagine would be effedually clear’d up by fuch an implicit Obedience; he had too moft extravagant Expectations from fuch an Interview, and did not doubt the immediate PofTeffion of the large Fortune fhe boafted of, as well as her Perfbn: A Woman, enamour’d as fhe was, furely could deny Nothing to the Man fhe fo paflionately lov’d, one happy in fo engaging an Addrefs, in a Perfon fo lovely, fo replete with infinuating, bewitching, and ir-refiftable Charms.
I By his forming thefe politick and defigning Schemes, ’twas eafy to difoover him to be in a great Meafure difengag’d from thofe Ties of Love with which he had been heretofore fo effectually muzzled j in good Truth, her avow’d Sufpicion of his Honour, calling him Compting-Houfe-Drudge, together with fome other difrefpeCtful Expreflions fhe had us’d, had very much weaned him from giving into thofe fond Foiblejfes, and diverted his Purfuits more direCtly into the Channel of Avarice ; which is a farther Specimen of Vrganda's Addrefs and Dexterity, who could with as much Eafe extinguifh as kindle thofe fictitious Flames. But this Refpite was given to his amorous Pangs only with a View of redoubling their Force, and if Vrganda lives, they fhall as furely return as a Fenian Ague; ’twas but diverting herfelf by Halves, to fee him engag’d only iq
^^^triying Means of enriching himfelf,
/
During this Vacation it was, that he employed his Wits to find outfome Means of retaining the Letters > and at the fame Time, regain the Efteem and Favour of his 'Unknown ; in Order to effect that, he very judicioufly excus’d his Difobedience, by pretending his Fear of their Mifcarriage; and to foften the Rigours of her Refentment, artfully murmur’d at her making fuch harfli Returns as fhe did to his Paf-lion.
This perhaps is the only Epiftle in the whole Series of his Correlpondence that he penn’d in cool Blood, without having his Quill lhaken by the feverilh Palpitations of an enamour’d Heart ; and therefore by theDidion of this only the Reader is to form a Judgment of his Ability and Capacity. The Prolixity on’t is a farther Proof that his Mind was more fedate, and his Spirits riot fo volatile as formerly.

He had fo little Doubt of this having the defired Effed, that he immediately acquainted his Confidanttf with the Contents cf it, and could not avoid ex-prefting his Admiration at his own Adroitnefs and happy Turn of Wit, in fo dexteroufly parrying the impending Blow, by forging fo plaufible an Excufe for not having lent the Letters, but was more particularly loud in expatiating on thofe beautiful Paragraphs,

The Aire like wife of Triumph he had afliim’d, and the pofitive Affurance he had entertain’d that flie would condefcend to any Terms rather than his leaving the Kingdom fliould deprive her of all Hopes pf an happy Confummation of her Amour, made it necelTary for Phillis to realTume herfelf, and be very peremptory in enforcing that Proof of his Obedience which die had fo often exaded ; befides, there was (as before hintedJ very good Reafons to induce Vr’‘* gmda to wifh for a Review of her Letters; fhe therefore very fpeedily after the Receipt of his lafl:, wrote to him in the following Terms.

But now, with down-caft, contrite Countenance, and flow melan-cholly Pace, he approaches, and moft devoutly turns up thofe Clods, which till now had been the fkred Repofitory of all that could be didated by the foftefl: Love, and to them commits the dear Remains of his expiring Joy, a levere Proof of an unreferv’d O-bedience ! earneftly invoking the Powers propitious to obfequious Lovers, to guard that ineftimable Packet from the unhallow’d Touch of or Hog-Loufct to drive far from thence the filthywho, blind as the God that dragg’d Philander thither, might prophanely difturb thofe Alanes of his Love, and la-crilegioufly expofe them to the Air, and humane Eyes.
As foon as he return’d and acquainted his Confidante that he had thus pundually obey’d the Commands of his charming Tyrant, Ihe jocundly rode thither, and foon rak’d up the Seven-Seal’d Box, in which ftie found he had been exadly pundual in not embezzle-ing one of her Billets, among which flie found this mournful and complaining Iflue of his Brain, which her crudLCommand had extorted from hinj.

Q T Have taken up my two Letters, with yoUr’s^ ‘ and had firmly determin’d to meet you next « Week, but that unlucky FatCj which has hitherto ‘ prevented my long-expecfed Blifs, has now thrown ‘ a Bar in my Way more fatal than all the reft : I ‘ am under an abfblute Neceftity of going to Holland, ‘ for 1 Yefterday received a Letter, that my Brother ‘ and Sifter are coming from Paris, and expecl to < meet me there to fettle our Accompts. I am under ^ fo great Obligations to him, for the prodigious Im-^ provements he has made of my Fortune, that I can’t refufe to meet linu, tho’ ’tis Death to me to

‘ think of going without feeing you : But when I re-‘ fled on the repeated Affurances you have given me of
‘ eternal Love and Conftancy, I am more at Eafe, and
‘ fltall, with all imaginable Speed and Chearfulnels
‘ go and finifli my Affairs; but beaffur’dj I have
‘ left fuch a Spy on all your Adions, that I lliall
be convinc’d before my Return, whether your
t Profeflions of Conftancy are real, or not; any Con-
verfation you have in my Abfence with any of my
‘ Sex, will be infallibly communicated to me ; but
‘ if I am confirmed, by your good Behaviour, in my
‘ good Opinion, you fhall, at my Return, be the
‘ happieft Man breathing, if you can be made fo by < an abfblute Poffeflion of Riches and Grandeur, and

This produced a Scene entirely new, and different from the reft; nor was it a-whit lefs entertaining ,• he rightly imagin’d, that he lliould not now fb often as formerly be blefs’d with thofe Specimens of the Fair one’s Love, Wit, and Gallantry, the Conveyance of Letters from Abroad being infinitely more flow and uncertain, and by that Means lofing the Pleafure of expofing to his Confidante, and others, thofe amorous Billets, in which fuch advantageous Mention was made of his dear Self, apprehended he might meet with many Mortifications to his Vanity, flom the ill-natur’d Suggeftions of fome of his Intimates,
JL	^	XX XX XX	X XV X •	X X
mates, who might pretend to believe, that he had not Charms enough to maintain his new Conqueft ; and that it was owing to a Decay of Inclination, that
had made this plaidible Excufe to difcontinue her Correfpondence.
To obviate therefore any Difficulty of this Sort, he roundly publifli’d to his Confidante-, and to all the reft whom he had admitted to any Share of his Intimacy, that his Fair one had at laft furrender’d, and
that the Houfe fhe had provided for him was now the Scene of their amorous Rencounters ; that he there in her Arms did ev^ry Night forget all thole anxious Cares and provident Inquietudes infeparable frcm the Man of Bulmefs that, as the utmofl: Summit of his AmbitioA was terminated in the Enjoyment of her, he had now no other Care or Concern, but to find out every Day new and diverting Amufements, in Order to while away the Remainder of an indolent Life, and give a Reliffi to that State of Tranquility and Pleafure in which he was fo happily fituated.
Vrganda had given him and herfelf a Refpite for three Months, in which Time, his Invention had form’d thrice three Thoufand Lies, and during which Time, he would often with folemn Gravity recount fuch amorous Circumftances, as he imagin’d Would attend an unreferv’d Intimacy with his unknown, enamour’d, trivial Incidents, and fuch as could not befu})pos’d to enter into the Thoughts of anyone who was not perpetually ruminating (as he was) on his fantaflick and expelled Felicity.

In this Manner did he long continue to entertain and divert the fneering Tribe of his Acquaintance, who, inform’d by Vrganda of the Progrefs of his Intrigue, could not but heartily delpife him for fuch an accomplifli’d Series of Lying and Vanity.
At laft, Vrganda fortunately found an Expedient for Conveyance of a Letter by the publick Poll: from Hollands which came to his Hands, and was con-ceived in thefe Terpis.

He was thoroughly fenfible, tliat the expoftng.this would falfify the Romantick Stories his vain Imagination had eqiiipt him with, and with which he had fo long diverted his Acquaintance ; the greateft Favour now that his Confidante^ or any other had to boaft of, was the Sight of Phillis's Name at the Bot-

tom; fince he was admitted to fo intimate a Familiarity, as he pretended, ’twas ealy to infinuate, that Letters from a Miftrels in that Situation might treat of Subjedls improper to be communicated. His I-magination was perpetually upon the Rack for the Invention of what he thought fine and fond Expref-fioas, with which he would confidently affirm his Billets abounded, and a Quire of Paper would fcarce have contain’d the Quotations he made from this laft I.etter; nor was he at all lefs cautious of affirming, in the moft folemn Manner, Fadls, as monftrous, as falle; for no Circumftance occur’d to him in Con-verfation or Reading, that had any Relation to Love or Gallantry, which he would not immediately af-fume, and as confidently recount as a real Incident in the Profecution of his Amour, infomuch that by Per-fons unacquainted with his notorious Propenfity to Lying and Vanity, he had been pronounced the darling Endjmion of the Fair, the moff compleat adonis of his Sex; tho’ the fmall Probability his Out-fide afforded of his being fo fuperlatively admir’d, did not a little contribute to raiie a Diftrufl: of what he was without Ceafe affirming.
’Twould naufeate the Reader to relate half the Circumttances which his Imagination didfatedas Attendants on the happy Poffeffion of his Phillh ; let it fuffice to be informed, that he took m.ore Pains to

In this Manner did he entertain his Acquaintance, and expofe himfelf} till he had exhaufted his whole Fund of Invention,and had not left himfelf oneLye he had not told before, fo was under aNeceffity of repeating or being filent; it was therefore judg’d feafonable now to amufe him with fomething new and furpri-2ing; and to effect this, Vrganda, who fpar’d no Pains for the Decoration of her Farce, found a Means of conveying to him a Letter, dated from Varisy and in fuch a Manner as could admit of no Diftruft of the Reality of its coming from thence.
How divided was his Heart between Love and Fear, when he received a Letter wrote by that Hand from Paris ! His confeious Guilt at firft made him
furmife, that his Boafts of Favoui's unreceived had reach’d her Ears, and then what was to be expelled, fomething dreadful muft enfiie. But before his Fright had proceeded fo far as to be attended with any {linking Confequences, to his inexpreffible Comfort, his Eyes were blefs’d with the following fweet, tender, and engaging Lines.

In vain was all this Pain and Caution, he, harm-lefs, loving, and gOod-natur’d, never diftrufted the Sincerity of his unknown Adorer, but was more and more confirmed in the Belief of it.
How defpicably mean and contemptible does that Perfon appear, who fuflPers thus his Reafon to be aCrea-ture to c3pinionatry and Self-conceit j notwithfland-
irig that Co0p d'Eclat of Vrganda’s, in taking fuch a dextrous Method of re-eftablifhing Philander in his former falfe and glittering Expedations , yet it can’t be fuppos’d to have that Effed-, had not the moft flagrant Spirit of Self-Approbation been predominant in our Hero’s Heart. It did not appear at all ifrange or incredulous, that once in an Age> his Perfon and Accomplifhments might fo far diffufe their Influence, as to precipitate fome enamour’d moifelle into* amorous Extravagancies ; but on the contrary, it had long been Matter of much Surprize to him, that till this Affair, the Female World fhould be fo indolent in foliciting his Intimacy, and that he had not till now met with one infpir’d with Love and Refolution to lay Siege to his Perfon and Affedions.
’Tis doubtful, whether the Difappointment Vr-ganda met with in not meeting with an Anfwer to her laft, proceeded from his DifBdence of the Reality of the Affair, or any other Accident ; the fmall Regard that is to be had to what he affirms in Relation to it, won’t permit any Certainty to be gather’d from him , for in whatever Capacity he ads, ’tis eafy

A felecS: Company was pitch’d upon to partake of the Diverfion, and obferve the obedient pundual Philander^ at the Time appointed, and in the Shape directed by his Vnk^own, appear at the Place of KendezAJOHs ; and not doubting but he would give his Attendance, made all necelTary Preparations for compleating their Mirth, and making him fervilely contribute to it.

Every thing was now in Readinefs, and the next Day, the Time which had been aftigned for the Lover’s Appearance, when fome accidental Engagement prevented one of the Company from attending at the Time appointed; this made it neceffary to adjourn it till the next Day, which obliged our Vrganda to write the following Billet, to acquaint him, that his

A
PHILLIS,
The long expeded Thurfday Morn rouz’d the
enamour’d Philander early from his Repofe, if that
can be properly applied to a Night fpent in anxious
Impatience for the approaching Dawn, with ftarting
unquiet Slumbers, often interrupted by the terrible
Apprehenfions of fome unlucky Chance to fruftrate
his now impending Joy j 3 Joy which had hither-
to
to been the Butt of Fate’s moft inveterate Envy and Malice.
As foon as he had adjufted his Perfon as well as his eager Impatience would permit, and covered it with a Scarlet Coat, the direded Charaderiftick, he mounted his Steed, and purfued his Journey to the Field of Love, wrapt in the moft agreeable Refve-
ries that could poftibly engage the Mind of Mortal, ruminating on the blelfed and long-expeded Opportunity he was now about to enjoy, in entertaining the beft and iovelieft of her Sex with a Thou-fand pathetick Profeflions of Conftancy and Paffion. Many quaint Sentences, and little ElTays of Wit, he had charged his Memory with, in Order to play ’em off upon the ftrft Interview, to improve the Prejudice fhe had fo manifeftly entertained in his Favour.
He, like a true and conftant Lover, unable to enjoy the leaft Quiet, but reftlefs and impatient for the happy Moment when his Angelick Charmer was to appear, had render’d himfelf at the appointed Spot fome Hours before the Time appointed ;	'
lb that Vrganda and her Friends, who had mounted their Nags merely to take a Survey of the expeding Lover, found him at all Points well accoutred, in the very Place, and Colour, which had been alTigned him, travelling the Qround as far as he thought the Limitsof his Patrole extended,and watchfully looking out to every Avenue from whence he could exped his kind Vnknown. They to take a nearer View, rode up to that Part of the where he was fo pun-
124	Tick : Or,
dual a Centinel, while he, cautious of coming near enough to be known, leaft ^any Acquaintance ihould accoft and joyn him, as carefully avoided them: In this Manner did they purfue him, and in Spite of all the Care he took to avoid it, he found ’em perpetually at his Heels.
When they had thus diverted themfelves as long as Riding was pleafant, to his great Comfort they gallop’d off, and left him to wait for the Arrival of his Phillis, which he did with much Oblervancy for many Hours, till to his great Chagrin he plainly perceived, he was not to exped that Day the Performance of her Promife. This was an infup-portable Addition to his former Difappointments, and happy it was that Tyburn was feparated by a Wall, a dangling Lover might elfe have grac’d that venerable PalTport to Eternity.
He knew perfedly well the four Perlbns who had been purfuing him, but was fo far from miftrufting on-^ what Errand they came, that he had a particular Plea-fure in amufing them with his being acquainted with their Ramble, thinking it ablblutely impof-fible for them to difcover how he came to the Know-^ ledge of it, by Reafon of the Improbability of their miftrufting him to be the Perfon they faw in a Place and Habit fo foreign from his Drefs and Refort.
But it was not long before the following Letter convinced him, that inftead of intermedling
with the Affairs of his Acquaintance, he had thofe
of
V	•	*
i
9	%
of his own of greater Confequence, which required his ftrideft Attention.

« think you capable of a due Submiffion to
Tour ever difobliged
PHILLIS.
P. S. ‘I had once Thoughts of never writing
*	again, but think it ablblutely necelfary to have my
‘ Letters, and I’ll lend you yours. I exped ’em ' at the Tree in three or four Days.----- I had
<	fortunately put on my Cloth-colour’d Cloak, to

f
’Twas, v/ithout Doubt, in Order to this, that the Company before Ipoken of were Ib affiduous in clofely purfuing him in the Park^ and fince they were not unknown to him, ’twas wonderful his Reafon did not diredl: him to lufpedfc the Source of the whole long tedious Purfuit he had been now two Yeais engaged in. But he, rivetted in the Allurance of his being in Reality the happy

Obje(9: of the AfFeftion his Vnknown had pro-fefs’d, did not fufped: but that the Whole was r^a!> iand prepared to convince her of his Inno-cehce> in Regard to the heavy Charge Ihe had branded him with.
Wherein confifts the Difference between fuch an irhaginary Amour as this of Philander's, as any other call’d a real one ? PhiUnder receives Affigna-tions, rejoyces, triumphs, and prepares with all imaginable Alacrity to obferve ’em, is difappointed, frets, curies his ill Fortune, till he is blefs’d with anothei* fi€i:itious Occalion of diflipating his Chagrin. Thus the feemingly more happy Lover, whom the fair Objedt of his Pallion blelTes with all his Wilh, with like Alacrity and Impatience waits for that Hour in which he promifes himfelf the happy Completion of all his Joys his warm Imagination didates, but when arrived, fuftains a DiC appointment not inferior to Philander^s; he traverfes another Circle of Hope, Expedation, Difappoint-ment, and Chagrin. Such is the Condition of us deluded Mortals, always purfuing, ever difappointed ; happy he, who does not fufifer himfelf to be carried away by any of thole tormenting and uneafy Fits of Pallion, but can love and dine with the fame Indifference, and be direded only by the Clock, and his Appetite.
Philander did not feem now very far from that defirable State his PalTion feem’d to be adjourn’d for ; the Convidion of his own Innocence,

This laft Difappointment made him refled to how little Purpofe he had gone through a long Series of Anxiety and Inquietude ; he therefore refolv’d boldly to averr his Innocence ; if he was believed, ’twas well; if not, he had gain’d Courage enough to ftand the Shock. Be-fides, he thought it but reafonable he fliould make Ufe of the Hold he had of her Affedions, and refolv’d roundly to play Truant, and to convince her, that he muft either have Wages, or no longer wear her Livery, wrote the following Letter, which Ihews more of the Man, and lefs of the Lover, than any the Reader has been hitherto entertained with.

The Wretch to whom the- Ottoman Tyrant dif-patches the faithful Mute-^ upon the View of the fa^ lal Bow-String, can’t fuftain a more tremendous Hor-^ tour, than did the trembling Philander, on Perufal of thofe peremptory and formidable Orders ; already he figured to himfelf the murdering Bravo making the threatned Demand, and without waiting for his Re-fufal, purfuing the fhocking fatal Command of the Perfon he had fo imprudently dared to provoke.
Thefe Contemplations could not but afford much Uneafinefs (not to mention the ufual Concomitants of a fudden» Surprize) to a Perfon of Philander s IkklTemper, great is the Value, ’tis confefs’d, he ah ways had for thofe dear Teftimonies and Certificates of her Love, but as to fighting for ’eub — he could do no more for her her felf; and therefore that laft unerring Proof of his Paffion would be inconfiftently given in difputing her Commands. ’Twas now ne-ceffary to find fome Means of appealing his angry Deity, and averting the fatal Effe<5ls of her Vengeance ; a Hecatomb of lying Vows, and Petitions of Pardon, would then have been thought a cheap Pur-chafe of her Favour.

in fending her Letters ; and left that Ihould not be judged a fufficient Attonement for his rafti and unad-
viled Defiance of her and her Power, was by no means fparing, in a fervile Submillion and firm Relblution, never more to rifque her Difpleafure, fince it threat-ned filch rueful Confequences.

.1 V
The laft Part of her Letter, no Doubt) extorted from him a lecond mean Submiflion, the Profpe(3; of her Wealth would inlallibly produce that ; but in what Terms it was conceiv’d, the curious inquifitive Reader has no other Means to know, but by a Jour-ney to the Tree, which he will find exa(5Hy fituated as herein before defcribed, where what-ever Anfwer the afflided Philander thought proper to fend, may be prefumed flill to remain, fince unmolefted by XJr-ganda^ who firmly adhering to her Refolution, contented her felf with the Pain Ihe had procured him by her former Management of him j who now jaded and founder’d, was peaceably (as foon as he could forget the infulting Rage, and infinuating Offer of fingering Forty Thoufand Pounds contained in her’s^ at Liberty to return to his humble Amufements of Brothel-Huntings (and what Nature defign’d him for) the Drudgery of a Compting-Houfe.
And long it was not before he enjoyed that State of Tranquility : Impreflions on Perfons of his foft and fhallow Capacity are almoft as foon crazed as made ; and momentary are the Effeds of the moft . violent Paffions and Difappointments on thofe, who like him are void of a poignant Refiedion, without
much
inucli Difficulty; therefore it was that he refunded himfelf and reverted to the dull, infipid, lifelefs Clod he was, before.his affiiming Vanity, heightned by the artful Applications made to him under the Difguife of an enamour’d Nymph, had infpir’d him with a ridiculous Vivacity.
Vrganda, contented with the flagrant and egregious Dilplay Ihe had thus made of the Follies and defpicable Foiblejfes of Mankind, and fated with the Diverfion ffie had in the Performance, found Means to comfort her felf, under a continued Series of Neg-led, by defpifing, like the Fox in the Fable, what hitherto had been out of her Reach.
How unjufl: foever it may appear, that the whole Sex fliould bear the Odium of what none but the
contemptible Obje(51: of her Amufement would be guilty of it, anfwered her End, in equipping her with perpetual Topicks of Satyr, and by that Means inducing a ftrong Probability, that it was owing to the Nicety of her Tafte, rather than to the Neglefi of her Cotemporaries, that ffie had not been celebrated as the Objed: of feme flneere and devout Paf* fion.
Thus fell the unhappy Philander^ a Sacrifice to the Revenge of the negledfed Vrganda; and happy for the reft of his Sex, if lb mean and worthlefs an Ex-piation will fuffice ; hereafter llie may in Rage be prompted to exercife her Invention on an Object more worthy, efpecially if encouraged by the Ap-plaufe ffie expe(fts to meet with in this Specimen of
her
her Abilities that Way; which if denied her, ihe has Dexterity enough to impute it to a Defign of preventing any further ill Confcquences that may attend fuch a Gratification of her Spleen, rather than on any Terms to fufpe<51: it poffible, that this Performance of her’s fhould not be tacitly (at leaft) appoved of and admired* *Twould be abfurd to make any affeiffed Apology for this long and (perhaps) tedious Detail of trivial and minute Circumftances, after the Author’s Approbation of the Performance has been fo frequently ex-* prefs’d in the Profecution of it. If it does not meet with the fame Applaufe in the Perufal, as it has done (by her) in the Compofition, ’twill be readily acknowledged to be the Effed: of the Reader’s nicer Tafte and better Judgment; in Cafe he does not approve of the Turn juft now given for hisDiflike^ being owing to his Fear of inftigating her to expofe any more the Foiblejfes of his Sex.
Thus prepared to endure the moft fevere Cenfure^ let it be either real or pretetided, Ihe concludes, with a firm Refolution to bear with equal Unconcern and Indifference, what-ever Reception her Performance
may meet with, either from the prejudiced or' im'** partial Perufers of it.
