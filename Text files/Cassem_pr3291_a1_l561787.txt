TH E eafhsrn way of writing hath been justly admired in all ages. The bold metaphors and noble simplicity aL most peculiar to the orientals add a lustre* to their compositions, not to be rivalled jby the greatest orators of Greeee and Rome. ThoSe who are in the least converSant in the oriental languages can evince the truth of this; and even the Englijh Reader may form fomo idea of their Sublime writings, by the tranjlation of the Jcrip-tiiresy which yet falls infinitely short of the divine original. The blooming fiow-r of the eajl loSe a great deal of their fragrancy and livelinefs of colour, become more languid and Sickly, by being transplanted to the colder climates of the North, The Arabs justly claim the preeminence

eminence in polite writing among the eajiern nations : for a great number of excellent authors have flourished among them, wlioSe works are extant to this day. Arabia hath produced many renowned philosophers, mathematicians, poets, orators, historians and physicians, who were the envy of their owny and the admiration of future agesA This may partly be attributed to the * liberty they enjoyed above their neighbours ; which, according to the	Longinusy conduces very
much to fine writing, and partly to the copiouSneSs and purity of their language, which remains almost uncorrupted dov:n to this time.
I have, in the following pages, endeavoured to fliadow out Some of the beauties of the original Arabic, and if I have Sailed in the copfy I hope the reader will pardon me, since the pidurc is almost inimitable, at least a very dissi-i cult tash for an unexperienced hand. i

This illustrious Arabian was born oSnobIc parents, and had an education Suitable to his rank and quality, as we (hall See in the Sequel.
His Sather, the renowned Hamid, was no IcSs famous Sor his knowledge and virtue, than he was Sor the lovelineSs oS hia perSon, and his fiiill in the art oS war ; Sor he dedicated a great part of his time to the study oS the Belles Lettres, and the improvement oS his mind, and united the ffkholar with the courtier and the general. His mother wras deScended Srom the illustrious race oS the Caliphs, and inherited all their virtues, tempered with a certain foStneSs peculiar to her fex. Her exquifite beauty chamied the eye like

Her eyes had a Sparkling vivacity, and darted innnmcrous rays on the behoHers like the fun in his might, inSomuch that (he was compared to one oS ihr. daughters of paradije. Caflem wa$ the only child oS this happy pair, and partici-pated oS the perSedions oS both, whether oS body or mind.
He was born at Lima, a city oS Arabia-Selix, (now called Ayaoaao) fituate on the Perfian gulf, which is known at preSent by the name oS the GulS oS BalSora, and near the deSart of ElcatiS. As Sor the exaQ time oS his birth, we have no certain knowledge of it, my author being Silent on this head. However, we may SuppoSe it to be about the 316th year oS the Hegira, or Mahometan ^ra, which anSwers to A- C. 938.

But theSe have a taste Sor arts and Sciences, dwell in cities# and encourage trade and commerce, f this being the plcaSatucst part oS Arabia, and abounding^ with Spices and odours. During Caffem’s inSan-cy he was attended by twelve oS the Sairest oS the daughters oS the land at hi« Sather’s houSe, §nd under the care and infpe^tion oS his pother. Zeboide, (Sor that was her name) as he grew up, feaSontd his Soul with the early love oS virtue. She cheristied every good idea, and impreffed it the more strongly on his mind ; but timely era** dicated, or at least checked the bad. The pure iinfullied mind is equally qualified to receive any ..J^mpreffions, like the unwritten page, and is apt to retain ihoSc ideas it first receives during its

Saw how greed-ily he imbibed every precept ; and how the first dawn oShis reaSon portended a strong and clear judgment, as the brightfiar oSthe morning Sore-tells the approach oS the dazzling lustre oS thi fun. She never Suffered the tendrejfe oS the mother to make her Sorget her duty to his noble part : Sor (he thought it not IcSs incumbent on a parent to cultivate and improve the mind oS a child, than to nourifh him with daily Sood, and to proted him Srom external injuries.
When he arrived at the tenth year oS his age, Hamid affembled all the wiSe men oS Arabia, and out oS them choSey« perSons who were verf-cd in all the learning oS the eajl, to form the mind oS young Gaffem, and to make him acquainted with the polite arts and Sciences; At the Sam^ time, he had an eye over him, and at proper intervals gave him all the instrudSions which, .hist-long studies, joined with a perSed knowledge of the world, had made him master oS. Under all theSe advantages, it is eaSy to imagine what great improvements a youth of Caffem’s genius
' and
( ir )
and capacity made. I stiall thereSore paSs over the occurrences that happened during the Sollow-years ; only obServing that he Spent that time without any interruption, ifi following the wiSest men oS the age in their reSearches aSter truth. They conduced him through all the/a-lyt-inths of the creation. They Sunk to the centre, or aScended above thediars, beyond the vast circumScrence of nature, till they were lost in the boundleSs regions oS immenjity. Hence they Sormed a great, but inadequate idea of the Supreme Being, and ended their Sublime enquiries in the adniiiration oS his incomprehensible nature, and tranScendent brightneSs.
I am now j(S^y® author) going to relate an incident in CafSem’s liSe, which, in my opinion, is no ways disadvantageous to the idea I have Sormed oS this great man. For noble minds ari not inScnfible oS the SoSter paffions ; but are rather the rooft SuSceptible oS love and Sriendfhip, as their SenSations are quick and lively. It is an account oS his amour with the lovely Selima, whoSe death, which happened about the nineteenth year of his age, put a period to his love ;

the origin and cauSe oS which \vere as lollows^i In his childhood he entertained a particular esteem Sor one oS the twelve virgins that attend-^^ ed him, which still encreaSed- with his years-. This Sair Arabian was deScended Srom an antient family, and SurpalTed all the daughters of the east in every thing that coirld render her amiable in the eyes oS the other Sex, or excite the jealouSy and envy oS her own. Her body was Sormed \vith the exaftest Symmetry to charm the eye y whilst the harmony of her voice ravistied the ear. Add to this the beauties oS her mind, and her taste Sor the Bel/es Lettres, which was infinitely Superior to that oS the generality oSher Sex. For file had been instrufiled in virtue aust philoSophy from her infancy. Her Sather’a fortune was reduced by repeated lofles at Sea, and a numerous family ; Sor he had ten Sons and twenty daugh'-ters. Selima and her parents parted with great reluftancy ob' iMlv Sides ; but the liarrowneSs oS their Sortane, andThe kind? invitation oS the noble Hamid, obliged her to do it, at least Sor a time, till Ibrahim (Sor that was her Sather’s name) fhould in Some meafure repair the breaches canS-

pd By cruel chance. CafTem, who at .first was charmed with the SwectneSs oS her temper, and her tenderneSs to him during his inSancy, as he grew acquainted with reaSon and philoSophy, doubled his esteem Sor the lovely maid when he perceived the nobler beauties oS her mind. Zeboide was So pleaSed with Selima’s conversation, that live begged oS her to continue at Hamid’s houSe, aSter the other .virgins were discharged. Selima’s grateSul Soul could not deny So eaSy a request, as (he had always met with the kindest uSage In Hamid’s Samily, and had cantrafted a great esteem Sor his Son, who was now in the Sixteenth year of his age. CaiSem was overjoyed at this propofal ; Sor the Sear oS being deprived oS the agreeable companj’’ oS this lovely virgin, by her quitting Cima, had given him an iineafineSs nnSelt beSore. By this means CafTem had Sre-quent opportunities oSSeeing and converfing with '^his beloved Selima, at his hours oS recreation, svhich he generally Spent in her company, Zeboide was not appt ehenfiye of the conSequence of thoSe interviews ; for Ihe attributed his love and ^t^findernefs to a childisti fondnefs, which he had
^oatraisicd
( 8 )
contra&ed Srom his inSanqy ; and was pleafed to fee this early instance oS Castem’s gratitude. Selima appeared more amiable in his eyc8 every day ; though he could not account Sor the growing paffion : Sor he looked upon it as an esteem for her learning and conversation, and never could attribute it to love, which infenfibly stole upon him. Alas ! how difficult a thing it is Sor man to know his own heart, or the latent fpFtngs and caufes oS his own happineSs or mifery. Selima, who was more advanced in years and experience, eafily perceived his love, but careSully diffenstled her own : Sor the flame was reciprocal. She thereSore Summoned all her philoSophy to her affistance, in order to check the courle oS this little Jlream, which, without proper care and prevention, would increase into a Surious torrent, that Sorces its way through all obstacles, and bears down every Scrupulous thought beSore it. She oSten entertained young Caflem with lating the pernicious effedis of love ; how it ei ' ervates the mind, and hinders it in its purSuit c philosophical enquiries. But this, instead of abating, increafed the flame j for he was charip-
'	'	€d
( 9 )
ed with the greatneSs oSher foul, the strength of her reaSoning, and the justneSs oS her Sentiments.
Gafiem and Selima were in this doubtSul Situation Sor three years, without coming to an echirdtjfement, though they had frequent opportunities to discover their Sentiments to each other; for they met every day, about Sun-Set, in a «Vro« grove, on the banks oS the river that flows by Lima, and waters the neighbouring gardens with its winding meanders. The limpid stream formed Several murmuring cafcades, and the Sanning %e-phyrs bore fpicey odours on their wings, and ivFtJpered whence theyflok them. The Seathered choir joined in the concert, and completed the harmony. This was the Scene where the lovers met to communicate their thoughts to each other. Philosophical points were commonly the Subjedl of their conversation, which he difcufled with great judgment, and a becoming gravity.
" Selima was all attention to his Surprizing discoveries, and every truth came mended from Caffends tongue. On the other hand, pFtlofophy in So Sair a Sorm to him appeared doubly amiable ; Sor (he Softened the Severer studies with a peculiar grace,
and
( JO )
and strewed the path to virtue with the flowers of rhetoFte. Perfuqfion dwelt on her lips, and honey flowed in every harmonious accent of her tongue. He never interrupted her diScourSe, but was al-ways extremely attentive ; till at last her virgin-modesty would check her freedom, and make her stop stiort :—For (he thought it imprudent to engroSs the conversation to herSelS ; eSpecially as (he looked upon it as her greatest happinef* to hear his stronger reaSonings, the reSult oS hi? cloSer application, and maSculiue judgment.
Thus the happy Caflem and his beloved Sell-ma continued in this mutual intercourSe oS the fublimest Sriendstiip Sor a confiderable time ; till at last an untimely Sate Snatched the beauteous Selima, in her early blpom, and in the Space of one hour Separated them Sor ever. Alas ! how precarious is human happineSs 1 How fleeting are the joys ! how tranfitory the pleaSures oS the Sons oS men !—The all-wiSe Allah has given us a' ^ mixture oS pleaSure and pain in this world, in order to make us aSpire to the happier climes of pa. radife, whok ]ojs are unfading, and vvhoSe inhabitants are immortal. We must not therefore-
think
( ” )
think ourSclves fixed or fettled in this prcfent state ; it is rather a cara’uanferah where we must take up with numberlcSs inconveniences, and meet with many rugged difficultiee in our way to the lowers of blifr, our happier and more durable Seat.
It unSortunately Sell out one evening, that the unhappy Sdima, according to appointment, came first to the citron grove, and happened unwarily to walk among the arowai/V reeds, which grew very thick by the river fide. She was unmindSul oS the danger oS Srcquenting Such places ; her mind being wholly taken up with the thoughts oS Seeing her beloved Caffem. It is well known that Arabia abounds with \feraphs, or winged ferpents, which are Speckled, or oS Several colours, but not very large : they love Sweet Smells, and frequent Such trees at, bear Spices, and the marsties where the cajjia and aromatic reed grows. The Arabians cover themStlves with fliins, and burn fsjrax when they gather the cajfia, in order to defend themSclves Srom thefe Serpents ; Sor theif

Venom is So averfe to the animal economy, that It destroys the principles oS liSe in a Sew minutes, by coagulating the blood, and abrading the folids. Selima, by the rustling oS the reeds, routed up one oS theSe ferpents, which stie no Sooner Saw, but (he Selt a fatal wound in her Snowy arm. She started back—but it was too late to elude the winged death. The Subtle poiSon Soon inSedied fluids, and (hook every fibre in the beauteous frame ; which threw her into Such an ^gony> that Ihe could no longer Support herfelS. Stic Sell down languid and pale, like a blooming flower that is blasted by Some baleSul dew, and droops to riSe no more. A heavy torpor Seized the extremities oS her body, but had not as yet reached the vital parts ; Sor (he still retained the fenSe oS her prefent miSery—and Sormer happineSs. She was in thefe dreadSul circumstances when Calfem repaired to the uSual rendez.vous. Ashe approached the place, he Snw the Sair^ Arabian stretched on the ground, which made hinr start back with horror ;—but recovering himSelf, he advanced, and Sound her just expiring ; and Soon, too Soon, perceived the Satal

tauSe. Words Cannot expreSs the griet that harrowed the wretched CalTcm’s Soul. It was too big Sor vent.---All the love and tender-
neSs which he had beSore concealed, and hardly understood, notv rUlhed upon his tortured mind at once, and checked his Saultering tongue. At last his Sorrow forced utterance, and embracing her in his arms, while he bathed her with a flood oS tears, he thus Spoke :	“ Alas! my dear Se-
lima ! ’Tis (he 1 Art thou gone Sorever ? Shall the fineerest Sriendstiip, the purest love that ever warmed a human breast exist no more ? WitneSs heaven ! that I would willingly die ** to Save thy precious liSe, which now like a dying lamp quivers on a point just ready to leave its “ lovely manfion.”—Here a briny torrent intcr-rnpled his Speech.—Thrice the lovely virgin aflay-ed to Speak, and her last struggle gave her utterance. She held up her dying hand, and whilst her eyes overflowed with tenderneSs, Ihe thus Spoke in broken accents ; “ Farewell Sorever !—-My Soul “ hovers about thee as loath to quit its hold I hasten to the immortal bowers of paradife, ** which are prepared for the lovers of virtue.
C	unlefs
( H )
“ unlefs /ow, the fineerest, tenderest lo’oe for Caflem be a crime."—Here her Speech Sailed her, the purple Jlream oS llSe ceaSed to flow, and the icy hand of death cloSed her eyes. Caflem’s grief was So great that he could not quit the breathleSs corfe, and the houfe being at Some distance, he in vain called for Some help ; till at last one of the eunuchs, who was fent to call him to his studies, Saw this mournSul Scene, and alarmed the houSe. Caflem stifled his grieS as much as poffible, In order to conceal his love; bat Hamid and Zeboide eafily perceived the difle.m-blcd flame, notwithstanding all his efforts to the contrary, but out of a good-natured tenderneSs feemed to overlook it. Selima was much lamented by Zeboide, and all who had the happineSs oS her acquaintance, and was interred with decent pomp.
eaffem’fr grief gradually abated by a cloSe ap-' plication to his studies, and his conversation with preceptors about the government of the paS-fions. PFtlofophy almost entirely engroffed hia mind ; which, together with the lofs of the lovely Selima, made him kf&fufceptible of the Softer
paffions
( H )
paffions than he had been heretofore. The latter gave him a more melancholy cast of mind, and made him more Inclined to (hades and Solitude ; however, he thought himSelS very happy in enjoying alternately the company oS the wifejl ©f men, and the befl of parents,.
He continued in this Situation till Hamid thought he was arrived to years oS maturity, and that the conduft oS his liSe might be leSt to his own judgment, which now discovered itSelS in the JustneSs oS his thoughts, and the uncommon strength oS his reaSonings. The /ages were of the Same opinion, and Srankly owned that he was capable oS no further improvements from their instriKstions.
Being now arrived at the twenty-JirJl year of his age, he was leSt to follow the hent of his own genius. He clofely purfued his studies in a country retirement, (which he had made choice oS) about a parafang from Lima, wejlerly towards the deSerts of Elcatif. He Soon got the reputation oS a great pFtlofopher, and was called Cajfem the Wife ; which name is frefh in the memory of the Arabs to this day. His love of
Solitude
( *6 )
fplitude made him prefer this little retirement to the noiSc and hurry oS the town ; however he repaired to Lima every day, in the cool oS the evening, to vifit \d\%pqrents, and to communicate his new diScoveries to his father Hamid. He went on for Several years in this way of liSe, giving and receiving the most; exquifite pleaSure ; a pleaSure which none can be fenfible oS, but thofe who have experienced the inexpreffiblc delight accruing Srom a true diScharge oS the du. tics oSparent and child, and from purSuIng light and truth to their Source.
But alas !—-this happineSs yvas too great to be oS any longer continuance. The bitter cup of Sorrow allayed the Sweets oS the unhappy CaS-fem’s liSe once more : Sor Hamid and his lovely conSort refigned their breath within the Space of one moon, and leSt hirp, notwithstanding all his philoSophy, almost inconSolablc.
Having discharged the last offices to his de-ceaSed parents, he quitted Lima, and confined stimfelS entirely to his rural retirement, where he fpent the remainder oS his days. His grieS gradually wore off, ^nd every boisterous paffiop
fubfided
( D )
Subfidcd by the force of reafon and philofophy. He at last acquired Such a Serenity and calmneSs oS mind, that he applied himSelS almost wholly to reveries and meditations, without perplexing him-fclS too much with the Severer studies. He oSten made little excurstons into the deSerts oS Elcatif, in the cool and dewy evening, and made the fi-lent mom the witneSs oS rhapfodies. The works oS nature were oSten the Siibjeft of hii contemplation, from which he gradually aScended to the Great Creator, and concluded with praiSe and thanksgiving to the all-wiSe Architeft of the stupendous uniyerSe.
Though he lived for many years in this retirement, (which grief and his love of Solitude brought him to) Sar Srom the conversation of men ; yet he was quite averSe to thoSe who, out of philofopFtck pride and arrogance, hate or de-fpiSe the human fpedes. He still retained the tender Sentiments oS Sympathizing humanity, which are inSeparable Srom a great and generous mind. The Sollies oS mankind moved neither his hatred nor diSdain ; but he endeavoured to irai-tistc the Great Author of our hhg, who extends
( I8 )
tends his mercy to all his creatures, though infi-filtcly below him ; and rather pities than derides their numerous foibles : in Ihort, he was So accuf-tomed to philoSophical contemplations, that his thoughts were in a manner Spiritualized ; info-much that the neighbouring (hepherds took him for one oS the fpirits of paradife, who arc diSen-gaged from matter ; or, at least, one that con-verSed with the genii. Indeed his venerable af-peft made him appear Something more than hu-man j and by his goodneSs and benevolence, he feemed little inferior to \dxokguardian genii, who are constantly employed by the Supreme Being for the good of mankind.
Although Caflem was a great admirer oS the Works oS nature ; yet his fpeculations were not confined to material obje3s, the intellectual world being often the fubjeft oS his proSoundest contemplation. He observed with admiration, that ^he immaterial foul operated on an organized body, and received all its pleaSure and pain by the Senfes ; and as the great Allah and his holj prophet had promiSed eternal happineSs to all tru« mujfulmans,* he could not conceive how the nakea
foul
( o )
foul could relisti the pleafures of paradife. He thought it more than probable that immaterial be-trigs communicated their thoughts to each other ; but whether it was by difcourfe or mtutdton ; or whether they had any other inlet to happineSs, different Srom the corporeal SenSes, he could not determine. This excited his curioSity, and Set him upon a striker enquiry into the nature oS the rational foul.—The pleaSures of paradife, according to the Mahometan religion, Seemed to be adapted to the groffer Senfes ; Such as flowery lawns and waving woods, Sunny hills and stiady grottos, bubbling Springs, warbling birds, fields eternally green, and Spicy odours waSted by Sanning zephyrs. TheSe were to regale the Souls of just men while they carefled the daughters of paradife, who being divinely Sair, immortal, and bleffed with perpetually-renewed virginity, were to complete their happineSs.
Caflem, whoSe Sentiments were elevated and Sublime, thought theSe pleaSures by no means adequate to the vast defires oS an immortal Soul 5 at least a Soul like Ms, w'hoSe thirst aSter kpow-ledge was infatiable. However, the deSerence
he
( 20 )
he always (hewed to the holy prophet made himi conclude this might be Some part oS the pleafures of paradife ; but the Sublime idea he had Sormed oS the Supreme Being induced him to believe, that the infinitcly-wife and good Creator had In store other pleaSures more adapted to the nature of immaterial beings, to conSuramate the felicity of good men in a future state. ThereSore Srom the constderations of the goodneSs and omniSci-enee of the Deity, and the strong defire aSter knowledge he experienced in himSelS, he could not help thinking that the gratification oS that dejire must be the chieS ingredient in the happineSs oSparadife. TheSe refledtions led him into a labyrinth too intricate Sor his most abstrafled and buSy thoughts. He Sormed many curious hypothefes and wild conjeflurcs : but all could not SatisSy his wavering mind. He oSten prayed to the great Allah to cast a beam oS light on his Soul, and irradiate his glimmering conceptions. He longed to pry into the intellectual fyflem, and earnestly wilhed that one oS the winged Spirits would vouchSaSe to deScend from the empyreum and Ihcw him the mysteries of the other'world*
The
( 2i )
The omniscient Allah (Says my author) who never flumbers nor steeps, and whoSe ears are always open to the prayer oS the pure, untainted, mind, heard his request, and Sent one oS the winged meffengefs who always stand beSore. his throne to SatisSy his doubts, and calm his Soul. The heaven-born mestenger, quick as lightening, darted Srom beSore the throne to obey his high behests : Sor thoSe benign fpirits that are Sent to Succour and relieve the good and virtuous, Sor greater difpatch, are begirt with a thoufand wings ; whereas thoSe that execute vengeance otl the wicked having but ten wings are not So Swift in their flight through the fields oS ather. The genius lighted on the top oSa mountain near Lima, and alTumed the Sorm oS a venerable old mani Here he waited Sor an opportunity to addreSs the happy CafTem, who now approached the place immerSed in thought and contemplation on the works oS nature. His mind was gradually elevated, till he was lost in a thouSand SruitleSs enquiries about the fpiriitual world, and the state of departed Souls. The genius perceived the perplexity oS his mind ; Sor fpiritualfeittgs can eafily
D	dilcern
( 22 )
diScern the thoughts of men without the help oS diScourSe, either by the outward lineaments of the body, or the different modifications oS the foul, or both together. I cannot (continues my author) give a more lively deScription oS this happy interview than in Caffem’s own words, which arc as follows.
Evening Meditation ben-Hamidy being an emblematical de--Jcription of the Refurreflion.
*	T Was walking, a Sew nights ago, over the ‘ hills in the western and unSrequented paths
*	oS the city oS Lima, which looks towards the ‘ deSert oS ElcatiS, in order to reSrelh mySelS after

*	walking, I Seated mySelS on the head oS one of
*	the highest among that verdant range oSmoun-
*	tains, and gave mySclf up to a profound con-
*	templation on the works oS the Great Creator,
*	which at that time preSented themSelves to my
*	view in the most charming proSpc£S imaginable :
*	the height oS the place, the fitnefs of the fea-

*	which were then Silvered over with bright ‘ moon-stiine, Spread through my Soul a tranquillity not to be Selt, but by a mind free Srom ‘ guilt, and raiSed by the raptures oSreligion and ‘ devotion. On the one hand oS the Summit where ^ I fat, the town appeared buried in Sleep and

*	overflowings oScompaffionate humanity, which, ‘ arc natural to a generous mind : on the other

*	cultivated dimenfions ; and by the vastneSs and
*	ruggedneSs oS the landfcape struck my imagina-

*	observe nothing throughout its Savage wastes
*	but caverns and precipices, broken recks and
*	mountains, hollow vales, Sandy plains, and gloo-
*	my Sorcsts, with which it was covered. At the ‘ Soot oS the hill the river which watered Lim^

*	place, the SeaSon, and the objc6i oS my medi^

*	I could not help imagining, that the Same em-

*	Some analogy to ihoSe, which regale the depatt-

*	my thoughts grew warmer, and fired by de-‘ grees, 2. philofoptical thought, which had often
*	perplexed roe, and which I did not find eaSy to ‘ anSwer, started a-Srefh to ray mind. How (Said ’ I to mySelS) can the Spirits oS paradife, stript
*	oS the human body, taste the delights oS thofe
*	SoSt and indulgent climates P How will the
*	naked Soul be able to behold the wonders of
*	creating art, which is So proSuSely poured out
*	on thoSe region^ oS bliSs and immortality ^ ‘ Can they See the verdtire oS the hills, or the ‘ flourilh of the fields, when they have leSt their

( 26 )
*	mortal eyes behind them ? Or how can they be ‘ ravistied with a concert oS warbling birds, rill-

*	the ears of the body ? Sure in vain will blof-
*	Soms emit their odours, and groves of Spices
*	will perSume the air in vain, iS the power of *fmelling ho utterly extinguilhcd in Separate fpi-

*	be entirely gone, and the nerves can Seel no

* While I was lofing mySclS in theSe enquiries, ‘ I Saw a man fitting on the head oS a mountain,
*	and at Some distance, who with a look dawn-

*	perplex thy mind with the unSearchable mystc-‘ rics oS our world. Know thus much—I am
*	a gemus, my name is fecret, the place of my ‘ abode is remote and hidden : joy dwells there,
*	and darkneSs intercepts the light oS it—asture
*	thySelS, thou Son of Hamid, that the unembo-‘ died fpirits amongst us are perSedlly holy and

(	27	)
‘ happy beyond thy glimmering conception*
*	What avails it thee to know how they con-‘ verSe, what they See, where they dwell ?—
*	CeaSe thy curiofity, and calm thy mind.i ‘ Wouldst; thou know what we do there, and be ‘ acquainted with our enjoyment; lovzihy Makeri
*	converse with thy own heart, and delight in ‘ doing good. The time hasteneth in which we ' fiiall receive our bodies—for the duJifhaW quick-' en, and thc/o«/be reunited. That which now ‘ lies in the grave stiff and pale, hastening to ' clay and a(hes, stiall revive, stiall brighten, (hall ' fly away, beauteous as morning, vigorous as ‘ light, unSading and immortal.

Lo 1 he ’ Sets thee an example, and inSpires thy hopes. He glorifies his Maker ;—he winds his filkeri nest Sor the good oS others, and retires inward ; —having done his work, he dies being ' dead he riSes again.

*	Formerly it crawled along with a flow and

*	gilded wings.—How much improved in its ‘Spangled covering, when all the gaudineSs of
*	colour is Scattered about its plumes ! It isr
*	Spangled with gold and Silver, and has every

This mwfiUfcFtpt Was found among Castem^s papers aSter his decCaSc, written in letters oS gold. The original is preServed with great veneration to this day ; as it contains a treaSure of natural and moral knowledge, which the Arabians were
E	entirely
{	30 )
entirely ignorant oS beSore. • Castem ia thereSore reckoned but little inSerior to the great Zoroaf" ter, Sor his learning and knowledge, or to one of the prophets, Sor his piety and Sandlity.
ASter this agreeable vifion, he Spent the remaining part oS his liSe in caSe and tranquillity oS mind, and in preparing himSclS Sor the happier climes of paradije, which he confidered as approaching nearer, as his strength gradually decayed. He departed this liSe in the 70th year oS his age. He quitted the beauteousof a well-Spent liSe with a graceSul .• Sor he met his Sate, with an heroich constancy, and a great-neSs oS mind almost peculiar to himSelS. He Serenely Smiled at the approach oS death ; for his foul longed to be on the wing, and to quit her earthly manfion, not without the comSortablc hopes oSbeing re-united one day.
He was greatly lamented by all the wife men of the east, as his death was an irreparable loSs to the commonwealth of letters. Castem enjoyed an uninterrupted state oS health, and a vigorous old age. No violent paffions rustled his mind ; no dtfeafe racked his body. He was a stranger to
intemperance
r 31 )
intemperance and debauchery, to anger and revenge, which are the latent caufes oS almost all the pain and uneafineSs incident either to body or mind. Nevertheless he always exp rested a compaffionate. Sympathizing tenderneSs Sor his fellow-creatures, zwA pitied thoSe miSeries he never felt. He was equally ayerSe to nrroroSeneSs, epicurean gaiety, andJloic apathy, taa word, he assted agreeable to the didiates oS right reaSon, and the laws oS the Great Creator. He'confidered his^o/? in the umverfe, the Several relations he bore to other beings, and SaithSulIy discharged the duties incumbent on them, in order to pre-ferve that univerSal harmony, by which all things fubfist. In h im were united the nroSoundest lofophy with the greatest affability, chearSnlneSs and good-nature. He was equally qualified Sor a hermitage or a court ; though he had riot the moroSe feverity oS the nor the trifling levity gS the other. I cannot conclude this imperSeft Jketch oS the illustrious eastern’s liSe with a nobler euhgium than that, which Abdallah'bcn-Alt gives this great Man :	“ He Was a Sriend to himSelf,
a friend to mankind, and a Sriend oS God.^’

I Hope it will not be thoiight impertinent her$ to Subjoin a Tranflation oSCastem’s Letter to Helim, his late preceptor. It was written a Sew days beSore his death, and contains his most private Sentiments, W’hich he Sreely unboSoms to hia friend ; for it Seems he always had a tender regard for Helim, and communicated his thoughts to withleSs reSerye than to any of his preceptors. We may, in the Sallowing letter, trace the fublimest friendlhip, cemented by gratitude, virtue and philoSophy ; and Samiliarized by the oriental (itnplicity. Helim lived to a very great age, and Survived Caflem a Sew months, whole lofs he deplored to the day oS his death.
To the illustrious Helim, the wiSest of men, the favourite oS Allah, the mirrour oS know-“ ledge, who knows the power of Simples, and the influences oS the moon and stars, the instruflor oS the ignorant, and the delight oS the eyes, the most hurabk oS his Slaves, and the rooft
“ obedient

obedient oShisSons, Calfetn-ben-Hamid, Send-eth greeting.
“ Deign, O IJelim 1 to leave thy fublimerstu-* dies for awhile, and to peruSe a few lines “ which thy Caffem lays at thy feet : Deign to accept the grateful odours of an humble Jlotver which was planted by thy hand, and watered ‘ with the fragrant dew of thy lips. Thou gavest ‘ me first to know the Supreme Goodnefs that '* made me ; and didst teach my liSping infant-■ ‘ tongue to celebrate the praiSes of the all-gra-'* cious Allah, Thy wifdom condu<^ed me ^‘ through the regierna oSimmenfity ; (hewed me ’* the various^^m4' that fill theunmeaSoredfface, and tatight me how the jarring elements were harmonized by t he Creator’s all-powerful word. Thefe truths are the light of my eyes, and the f‘ joy qS tpy heart ; they are more grateSul to the '* mind than the richest perSumes oS Arabia to the Smell, or the most exquifite pleafures to the “ other Senfes, But thefe treafures are bid from valgar eyes, and only attained by the Sons of knowledge and the Servants of Allah.

But as it affords me an inexhaustible Spring of joy at this important criSis, I (hall leave it to be publifhed at thy discretion, to whom I have preSumed to inScribe it.
