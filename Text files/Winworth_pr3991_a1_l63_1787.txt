Juliana and Harriot; my pretty coufins were very courteous to me, endeavour’d to vie with each other who should be the politer ; thefe ladies, I believe, dont agree ; there is envy apparently lurking in their hearts; I do fuppoSe a fine cap on

As I think it may amufe my friend, I Shall give her an account of our last night’s entertainment at home: Mr, Wilding, Mrs.
Simpleton, the dogs, cats, and maf-

on was perufing the coffee groimdsy and Mr. Wilding was talking to me of his hunting, race-ing, and Such, like diverfions ; he told me, he was once in love, but
his Dulcinea
thought it
proper to
forfake him; therefore he played

he would never fall into the fame

“ There’s a f ranger in my cupf (cried Mrs. Simpleton.)
Pray show him in,” (Said her facetious nephew.) It happened now there was a knock at the door, and a young gentleman entered; Mr. Wilding Saluted him, and ad vane-
g

MUST confeSs, my dear friend,
that your fituation makes me uneafy; however, I have news to impart which may remove Some
of your unhappinefs ; though I cannot approve of your Sudden paf-fion, your love for a woman whom
you know nothing about; a woman

who, perhaps, is beneath your lordfhip’s notice, yet I Sliculd not willi my friend was married without his own approbation ; that he
should

though the bride may be deferving of all his heart; in Short, that he should be wretched during life, for love is as requifite as fortune to render the marriage state comfortable and happy; I therefore advile you to be your own master in this ; but I have made a difcovery which may be of no Small advantage; I intended yesterday to go where Jack and I were So rude;, my father perceiving my preparation for vifit-

that
evening;
though Mr.
Benville expected a great nuinber, yet only four thought proper to come;
the rest Sent their apologies, when every thing for their reception was
I
prepared ; a rudenefs my father never can forgive. Our little aS-fembly were Lord Marlowe and
his daughter. Lady Qualm and Genera! Savage. Mifs Marlowe is very agreeable, and of a noble family ; her father is good com-

pany ;—Lady Qualm is very happy
over cards, and General Savage over
a bottle ;—the general is too fond of laying wagers ; he is prone to
contradict, and stake his money

upon a hazard ; Jack Sprightly and he entered into Several difputes; at

a hundred pounds it was So and So ;

Jack very oourageousty accepted the challenge, and laid down two, notes Sor fiSty pounds each; the General was long Searching his pockets for his purSe ; but to his great mortification of knowing he had not the Sum about him, was very fooliShly obliged to give up the argument and decline the propoSed wager.
I Shall paSs over all other particulars, and fend my friend a pleafing

““ You know Mr. Hartley!’’ (Said She) ** pray then do you know his ward. Lord Wiiiworth

(in CONTINUATION.)
^HE dear expected MiSs Marlowe has arrived with her father a few hours, ago ; but not being perfedtly recovered after he^ journey. Lord Marlowe and I did not think proper to proceed too haf-tily in bufinefs ; we have therefore deferred it till to-morrow. I have taken your advice, and shall not in-

We take pains in Lord Win-worth’s abSence to fpeak largely of his worth and goodnefs of heart j

there was a youth, who waited on him this morning, with, a production, hoping his lordShip would be
his patron and protect the offspring
/
of a tedious, but industrious night;
this was a little poem which Lord Win worth immediately took up ;
then addrefiing the youth, enquired
his name and late SucceSs
t
‘‘ I have no name” (replied the
young writer) no name, my lord, fufficiently great to recommend
my productions ; therefore, they are lying by till by hard labour I

“ and that without it, the greatest penmajler on earth was unworthy of encouragement, as he betrays a narrow heart and wants that which even beasts poffefs.”
My ward listened to the young man with no fmall attention : then
N	^
bidding him 'fit down, till he returned, left him with me, and step’d
into the next room ; after fome time he came in, and made the following

Say

‘ •	I
begged his lordShip to fign his name

to it, and let it be published ; but he declined doing it then, ’dll it was corrected, which he infisted
on

not hearken to them; he therefore

went in haste to make the correcti-

ons, but he had not long departed, till he returned again, with Smiles of genial pleaSure and tears of real gratitude. “ Oh, my Lord, he cried,
“ when I opened the parcel to make “ the corredtions,! happened to find theSe two notes for a hundred “ pounds each.’"
“ Well, well !” (replied Lord Winworth) “ take it away, make “ the corrections, go.”

My ward, who wanted to conceal
his bounty, was distrest that the
%
young man Should take notice of it before me; he endeavoured as much
as he could to difmifs the youth j —-the other’s extacy was too great to conceal it; he could not be Si-

When I Saw Lord Winworth’s agitation

understand was addrested to Mifs

Somers; it is unnecestary for me to make any protestations now, or endeavour to plead my innocence. I hope L have discovered the real

the readings,——but unfortunately .they were delayed ;—Lord Marlowe wished for Some merry tale,—my guardian for a plaintive elegy;—one would have this,—the other that;— poor Saville affured them he could

would one at a time, and pleaSe both

was the only lady in the room, and

fhould be expofed to every threatening blast I to be depending on the bounty^ the generofity of ftrangers what better am I than the wretch

tulations—I will confeSs—Mr. Sa-rille has brought a verbal meffags from Lord Winworth; his Lordship has offered to marry me, and requests my hand as the reward of his fervices; but how. can I reward
them ?—the annual Sum which my
/
henefaSior has allowed me, is lost
when I marry; it departs from me
to another ; and I have promifed on that account, not to give my
hand, till an equal Sum is feeured *. then instead of my giving to Lord Win worth, I shouldfrom him ! Alas ! my Constahtia, I am afraid his Lordship may think my pride is mors

fashionable, than honest; and repent
he ever degraded himSelf, by making,
*
me his choice.
Mr. Saville with true eloquence prelTed me to confider his Lordship’s request;—I was candid and fincere, and told Mr. Saville I was ashamed
to comply : that his Lordship would
\
find it a very,-rvery disadvantageous union, for I was very,—very unworthy of Such honor !——he in^
timated that Lord Win worth heard
A
I was to be married to another;——
I confefied to him, there was a gen-

tleman expected in ' London, to whom my hand was promiSed, pro-

-----he loves you my friend, and a
true lover fiirmounts every difficuL ty. As a. proof of my allertion, I enclofe a letter just brought to me from Charles,- who.knowa.his Lord-Ship and his virtues.
Gratitude is fufficient plea; for
your fubmistion to his Lordship’s

LORD WINVfORTH TO CHARLES BENVILLE, ESQ^
I N C E I had. the pleaSure of hearing from my dear Charles, I
underwent Such a Severe Scene,, as rendered my distreSs almost intolerable. Lord Marlowe, and you,r friend were indulging themfelves
’	I
with a recreating game of Billiards indeed, my thoughts were So takert^ up, and my patience being nearly exhausted—not feeing Mr.. Savillb, who promised to assist my love,--that his Lordstiip was the general winner. Mr. Hartley disturbed us

In a manner the most extraordinary.
and abrupt;—he addrefifed Lord
Marlowe, and affured him, his
daughter was found y his LordShip
who had almost forgot her before^
exclaimed with vindictive delight
Where is fhc Mr. Hartley,—
where ?—''
&
My guardian informed him; and
added, if his Lordfhip hastened td
Mrs. Simpleton’s, he might recover
his daughter, as he knew She was
not married' yet; Lord Marlowe

walked about with eager expect-
ations ; I was stunned! I was alarms

upon which I defired to accompany

him ;—but my guardian held me,--

manded me to stay with him, as
Lord Marlowe knew his own bufi-neSs.—I requested Mr. Hartley to unhand me, as I wanted to See Mist Marlowe; but he held me the morej, and with a frown of dhappointmentv and rage,, astured me this was. not the time for me to fee her.
I was greatly agitated.; my appre-henfions were strong, and I faw too
Hartley’s emotions, he knew I was an astistant in Mist Marlowe’s elopement:—when the enraged father was gone, I expected to.De hisjdaughter,un tears,, brought home..—I: hoped the lovers- would be married,ere Lord Marlowe Should find, her ;--but my fears were more prevalentI Sat down and remained

his thoughts were as bufy as mine^ and thus we hoped, and deSpaired, till Lord Marlowe’s entrance gave me Some confolation ; but when Mr* Hartley Saw the enraged father without his daughter,he instantly Suppos’d that MiSs Marlowe was. married and irrecoverable ;—accordingly he exclaimed with impatient vexation--Is She another’s my Lord I—is She another’^ i*”

There are inevitable accidents in life,

me to gather Some fruit, whWQ Lom
