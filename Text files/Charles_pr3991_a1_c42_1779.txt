I was afterwards informed, when I came to my Self, that the apartment belonged to the young gentleman who

brought me home, and whofe name
was Trevor.
He, in the most affedtionate manner, begg’d I would compofe myfelf, as rest was necessary for my recovery; and assured me, till I was fit to be removed, that I should meet with all the tendernefs and attendance that was in his power, and my Situation required.

Two days after being well enough to fit up, I thought it became me t<5 make enquiry who it was that I was indebted to for my life; as I thought I could perceive my proteistor poffeffed not an abundance, though perhaps a Sufficiency; therefore, we being by ourfelves, I thus began.

Sir, it is owing to your humanity and generoSity that I now exist; may I, without offence, crave a knowledge of the perSon to whom
“ I am under fuch infinite obliga-“ tions ?’*

“ You are under no obligations. Sir, returned he; I did no more than my

“ duty; a duty incumbent on every* man to his fellow-creature; I found
“ you oppressed; it wou’d have diS-graced the name of man to have
“ left you;—if you recover I shall think mySelf fufficiently repaid.”",
I afterwards made enquiry of the woman where he lives, to find if I could get any information from her,
who or what he was,—No fooner had
I
I ash’d the question but she burst out:

Ah I Lord be
good unto me!
“ he is one of the kindest. Sweetest “ young men, as I may fay, that ever “ liv’d—why he has the heart of a

Pray, has he any fortune ?”

“ Fortune ! no, Lord help him ; he is an honest man; he’s none of

“ No doubt of it—but if he has no fortune, pray what employ is he

In this halcyon manner did he live,

“ On their arrival in London a new Scene of Sorrow opened to view, for ‘‘ they found my grandfather confined

admitted—On her approaching the

Dear Ned,
O W kind are you to congratulate me on my preSent Selicity —stis indeed a felicity jiow beyond what I ever coulcl have expedled—this is produced by my having become familiar with the family—which at prefent conSists of Lord and Lady Woodland, Mr.
ThompSon
CHARLES.
59
Thompson and lister, MiSs Harriet Stretton, Sir William Freeman, an intimate friend Mr, ThompSon’s, who has been with us two days, and your humble Servant.
The happineSs of the noble pair Seems entirely wrapt up in that of their children, who are equally emulous to give them pleaSure *and Satisfaction—continually contriving amuSe-ments in wshich their parents can partake ; who, when weary, retire and leave us youngsters to enjoy our own pastimes—So that we live a life of per-fc(5l unanimity—and I almost begin to think mySelf transplanted to Arcadia.
D 6
Sir
\
6o
C H A R' L E' S.
Sir William Freeman, is one of the
%
most amiable men you ever beheld
f
gentee'l in his perSon—remarkably caSy in his deportment—and,by poffeff-ing an abundant flow of Spirits, reaps all the advantages of his agreeable vivacity—for he is, and justly too, a great favourite of the ladies—^-he has been intimate in the family a long time—therefore his freedom may be greatly accounted for.
Mifs Stretton is a lovely young lady, both in perfon and mind, and appears to be deferving of all that regard which Mr. Thompfon confesses
I
to have for her—I am of opinion they will Soon be married, as he informed
me
C H A R L 1 S

me they should have been before now, but for Sir Richard, her father, wlio is a very odd man.
In what manner can I defcribe the
filial, tender, lively Sophia, unlefs I
«
Say with Pope:
Bright as the fun, her eyes the gazers sti ike. And, like, the fun, they stilne on all alike :
Yet graceful eafe, and fweetnefs void of pride. Might hide her faults, if faults Jhe has to hide t
y
If to her Share fome female errors fall.
Look on her face and you’ll forget ’em alL
Though of rank and fortune, she behaves with eafe and affability to all she pays the fame attention to the request of a peafant, as to that of a
peer

\
peer—For accomplishments, I know not in which of the polite arts to give her the preference—she draws inimitably—fingirfg and muSic are as familiar with her as though she poSSeffed them by nature—and her dancing is |)eyond all I ever Saw—for yesterday we had a dance, on purpoSe as Mr. ThompSon Said, to keep Sir William from the vapours; at which there were about a dozen of the neighbouring gentry.
Sir William and Sophia opened it they Seem formed for each ether Mr. ThompSon danced two minutes, first with MiSs Stretton and then with another young lady, to prevent my

being called upon, as I was fearful of attempting it in Such company.
In the coLirSe of the evening. Sir '
William and I changed, partners—as
he lively term’d it, to get rid of a.
troubleSome companion—but I really
believe it was to make Some amends
*
to the young lady who had been un-’ lucky enough to fall to my lot—We did not break up till about three in the morning.—I know not what coulcl be the caufe of it, but every time I touched the downy hand of the amiable Sophia, my blood thrilled through all my viens—nor can I yet approach her without a tremulous awe, although she is CondeScenlion’s

CHARLES,
Self—Don’t you think it very strange ?
I am conScious oS the obligations I am under to the whole Samily, but find mySelf under no restraint to the rest.
In the midst oS this round of pleasure I cannot forget the many happy hours I have Spent with you, and believe me I shall always remain Senfible of the favour of your friendship.
Should any letters be left for me, be kind enough to incloSe and Send them here, as my lister knows nothing of this journey, nor do I intend to inform her of my acquaintance in this family till next Summer,
t
when
I
CHARLES.
^5
when I expcdS to See her—I never mention her here, as I would not
wiSn her to be introduced—She is
/
young, and perhaps Srom want of experience might not be able to withstand the temptation of title and equipage—for should any of the young gentry take a liking to her, as there are numbers viSit here, they would not hefitate a moment to accoiuplish her ruin, nor withhold one allurement that they thought would attradl: the notice of a mere country girl, and then to what a life of miSery would she be jubjed to.

We have had a vifitor here—and I

He is one of the ss rangest men that I ever beheld—My Lord and he has been acquainted ever Since they were children, by their family estates lying So contiguous to each other—Mr. Thompfon affurcs me he is a very worthy gentleman, and that he does a deal of good in the neighbourhood but his temper is very changeable and he always Suffers himSelf to be guided by his preSent opinion.
He came here in a great hurry yeS-terday, and had Scarce got in, before he began:—“ My Lord, I* am just “ come from London, where I have “ been but a few days, on purpoSe to y fetch my daughter—for to be plain

We were all Surprised when the Servant came ahd told MiSs Strctton of Sir Richard’s being there, and that he wanted her immediately—V/e Soon followed her in, and just got time enough to take our leave.

When they were gone,' my Lord acquainted us with all that had pasted making what Sriendly excuSes he could Sor the unaccountable diSpoSi-tion of his friend.
\
The remainder of the day was the
dullest I have Seen Since I have been
here—Sophia pined at the abSence of

Sir Richard to blame, for thus torturing two worthy hearts that mutually Sigh for each other—eSpecially as they are in every SenSe equally deServing.
Sophia I find, by this hint of Sir William’s, has got an admirer—I wonder who it is—he must be more than man to be deServing of her—O, Nel-

One night in the courSe of conversation Sir William Freeman happened to be mentioned by one oS the company, by way oS enquiry what was become of him, as he had not been feen in town for Some time. Sir Richard acquainted them he Saw him at your honSe on a vifit, where likewiSc was your humble Servant. Scandal, as I have been inSormed, immediately took the lead, and laid many accuSa-tions against his charadter, which, but for his abSence, would have ssept in eternal oblivion. Lady Fanny Soon found an opportunity to cxpreSs her disapprobation of Suffering me to remain there with him—the conSequencc of which I need not acquaint you.

CHARLES,
In one oS my letters you may re-
member I mentioned that Sir William
Freeman hinted at her having an ad-
mirer—he is here—it is one Sir Harry
Bowler, a very gay, agreeable man
but nothing to compare to Sir Wil-
liam—he was received with the greatefc
politeneSs, and appears to be highly-
approved oS, So that in all likelihood
I
as Soon as the preliminaries are ad
justed their nuptials will be con-
cluded on.
I most fervently wish it was over
for when she is once fixed perhaps
the ardour of my affection will; abate.

and the folid happineSs which my
youth enjoyed once more return-

How*

C H A R L
S.
557
However as I am conScious it will not be any better while I am thus continually in her preSence, it is neceS-Sary to try if it is in the power of absence to make any alteration.
To-morrow I intend to acquaint Mr. ThompSon with my intention of returning to town, and to urge mj indiSpoSition as the motive for de-Siring to leave him.
It will require the exertion of my ntmoSr refolution to enable me to leave this houSe, but leave it I will—Only ressedl:, my dear friend, how difficult it is to sty from the objedt we adore to Smother a flame that beauty has

what me most wish to attain !

That this may never be your cafe,' or that your affe<fi;ions may never be placed but where they can justly ex-pe6t a return is the constant and fin.-cere wish of

he affured me he would not be played with any longer—what he meant by it I cannot tell, but he strutted acroSs the room and looked So big.
Indeed he has had the inSolence once or twice to throw out infinua-

Serious thought to intrude in the midst of So much pleaSure—you knew he was not permitted to write—and he

I have been extremely ill, but be not alarmed, Sor it has pleaSed the Almighty once more to bleSs me with the proSpedt of health, and I am in great hopes, with his blessing, that a few days will perfedtly complete my recovery.
Scarce had I Sealed my last to you when I was Seized with a dizzyneSs, accomoanied with an amazing trem-

On hearing that I was So far recovered as to he able to fit up, she came with her brother this morning to See me—but, good Heaven ! how is she changed !—her eyes no longer flush’d with their Sparkling vivacity ! there remained no traits of her lovely

Mr. ThompSon and I being left together, the day after I Sent to you,
he accosted me in this
manner:
“ My dear Trevor, from the mo-“ ment I was Senfible of your worthy-nefs, exclusive of the obligation I “ was under, I conceived a friendship
for you, which has, from that time, “ been increafing—I have unbofomed ‘‘ myfelf to you, and made you master of every Secret wish of my heart, “ but still have you fubjedled me to ‘‘ the mortification of trustino; without

“ It would give me the greatest “ uneaSineSs, Mr. Thompson, did I “ imagine you thought me in the least “ deficient in my gratitude for your “ friendship-^As every perfon is liable “ to illnefs, I look on it no more “ than a common incident to which y human nature is Subjed to.”

“ I thought no leSs.”—upon which he got up and left m.e without uttering another Syllabic.
I remained Sor Some time in the greatest astonishment, not being ableto comprehend the meaning of his abrupt departure—In the afternoon he came again but took not the least notice of what had passed in the morning—his
behaviour was as friendly as ever, nor could my fuSpicious observation pcrceive_the least shadow of alteration in his manner during the whole time he w'as wdth me.

Notwithstanding when he was gone I found mySelf quite.diffatisfied, and I passed the night in a kind of un-eaSy fretfulnefs—I cannot defcribe it to you in any other manner than as that uneafinefs which one feels when in doubt and longing to be Satisfied not that I entertained any hopes or possessed the least idea of his befriending my affedtions.
Soon after I had finished my breakfast in the morning, walking about the room, being weary of fitting, and resseding on my unhappy Situation, I heard a rustling at the door and Somebody with a faint voice utter, “ I must—I will fee him before he

Abashed at the freedom I had taken, I stood confounded, while she blushed and appeared in the utmost confufion—which was greatly heightened by Mr. Thompson’s standing by, apparently enjoying our embarrafs-ment.

Why let two wwthy hearts ‘‘ know how much they esteem each “ other—Come, come, you must both forgive me this little deviSe, for it “ was the only method I could think “ of to be Satisfied of your possessing a reciprocal regard—What, though you are both alarmed,' and may, “ perhaps, be terribly offended, I “ shall have you, in an hour or two, come and fall upon your knees to “ thank me for having put an end to “, yoiir anxiety.—However if you will “ promiSe to be friends with me di-“ redlly, TU tell you a Secret—Does

I found that dissipate with which I was already poffeffed,' and an eafv confidence assume its place—therefore.
without hesitation, I addressed my Self
■
to his Lordship:


“ My Lord, as I have been fairly led in to diScover a Secret, which, from my Situation in life, I thought I was bound to conceal, 1 will not

“ Sphere with her I should not be “ treated with indifference—I now “ request I may be permitted to de-“ part Srom hence, and that you will still retain the favourable opinion “ you have hitherto honoured me
“ with.”
4C
But why, Mr. Trevor, do you
“ wish to leave us ?”
“ Seldom, my Lord, do we find “ it in the power of youth to govern “ their headstrong paffions.—By re-remaining in the Same houSe with ‘‘ your amiable daughter, my esteem

“ I know not that that would be “ the conSequence—I am not a mer-“ cenary man—nor shall the happi-“ nefs of my daughter be Sacrificed

Oh, NelSon ! what encouragement was this!—It is needleSs to attempt describing what I felt at that moment; a thouSand rapturous thoughts croud-ed at once on my buSy imagination and rendered me incapable of acknovv* ledging my gratitude.
They then retired, and left me to enjoy the restedlion of what had paf-Sed—which you may be Sure was a happineSs I had no great mind to debar mylelf of.

Y hopes arc baffled, and I shall
loSe this capricious piece of flesh and blood after all—here is one of

I fore-
ao6
CHARLES.
I SoreSaw the danger, therefore
found it necessary to draw up my
0
whole force and make a bold attack..
before the enemy was prepared to counteract my deSigns.
To accomplish which. I thought it would be most prudent to apply to-
ft
Lord Woodland, in hopes that his parental authority would prove a pow-crfulally—not doubting but he would put it in force—in that however I was most curScdly deceived, as you shall hear
I waited Some time for a favourable opportunity-—at length, Suppossng I had gained it, with all the rhetoric I
was
C H A R L E S.
%
was master of, I urged my love Sor ' Lady Sophia, the great happineSs it would give all my relations to be allied to Such a worthy family—and notwithstanding I should think mySelf
well rewarded after an age of attendance So I attained her at laSt, yet as I am compelled, from the pressing exigency of Some of my affairs, (which, by the bye, you know are preshn enough) to refide in London for
cr
L
Some time; and fearful lest in tha Space Some happier man might Supplant me in her esteem, I had taken the liberty, from never having found his Lordship averSe to my addresses, to Solicit him to intercede with his
lovely
2o8
CHARLES.
lovely daughter to bleSs me with her hand—and that the leSs anxiety she condemned me to while a lover, the greater tenderneSs and indulgence would she be intitled to when a wiSe to all which he replied :
iC
4C
44
Sir Harry, I have no objeebion to you or any gentlemen’s addressing my daughter—but you must get her “ conSent ere you can have mine
“ the choice of a hushand I have IcSt
\
“ entirely to her own prudence—in that depends the future happineSs of her life, and I am reSolvcd not to interfere, unlefs I perceive the greatest ncceshty.’’

This was a stroke that I was not in the least prepared for, as I did not SuppoSc any parent, especially in his
4
Sphere of life, would be So condescending to an only daughter—but as I had ever an averSion to viewing things of the wrong fide, I made the best of it, and immediately reSolvcd to purfue my attack another way.
My next effort I found must be to the lady herSelf, and as it was a kind of a d&rnier refort, I could perceive it would require the whole Ikill and dexterity of my generalship, prudence and circumSpedion to be exerted.
Lest
210
e H A R L 1 S.
Lest a too hasty procedure should intirely defeat all my deSigns, and that, a little time might be well employed in preparing her for the general attack, I reSolved to remain contented for a few days, during which Space I was in hopes of making Some impression in my favour.—Therefore, armed at all points for battery and dishmulation,
I
I fought every opportunity to be with her—if she Smiled, So did I—if her brow was o’ercast, mine was clouded too—and if a haif-fuppreffed Sigh stole from her unwary breast, I caught
the infedbion—but always took care
*
to do it in fuch a manner that she might be led to fuppoSc I did my en-
r*
deavour to ftifle it.
This

This behaviour you may be Sure did not paSs unnoticed, and 1 began to have the flattering proSpedt of Suc-ceSs, when Fortune, “ curSe on the “ changling deity,’^ by a Angle whifli
of her wheel, overturned all I had been doing,	•
Is it not most confounded hard just
as we imagine ourfelves to be on the brink of receiving a reward for all our labours to find we were deceived, and as far off from attaining the prize as ever ^—but to proceed.
This Trevor, (who I mentioned to you in a former letter) has been flightly indiSpoSed ever Since I have

but I begin to me' SuSpicious that she
«
listens to his addresses with pleaSurc perhaps I have been taking all this pains to mould her to his purpoSe instead of my own.

I think it highly necessary to have him dispatched from here, and Some-thing must be contrived for that purpoSe.

iS
on this occafion to exert it—lend me your assistance to fow the feeds of difcord and Suspicion, afid PU nourish
the cultivation of them or perish in the attempt.
Would to Heaven the Sword could

Mr. ThompSon intends coming to London, and you may depend on it that I shall accompany him. His reaSons for taking this journey are to et a determinate anSwcr fi*om Sir Richard Stretton, whether or no he will permit him to have his daughter nor can he be condemned for Such
a step, for he informs me stis now upwards of two years Since he first made
application to him, and never from that time has be been able to get him to declare his mind.
The behaviour of Sophia, my Sophia, NelSon, is all that the heart can wish—delicate without reServe—she
attempts not to diSguiSe her Senti
ments
A
CHARLES.
’ll
ments, but owns the* preference she gives me with a frankneSs peculiar to her diSpoSition.—I can never enjoy her company So freely as I could wish, by reaSon of Sir Harry Bowler, who came on purpoSe to carry her off; therefore you may affure yourSclf he never Suffers us to be alone when in his power to interrupt it.—We are on a very good footing, though rivals, and he often makes ufe of the faying “ win her and wear her,” for his part he tells me, until she has been before the man in the black gown, he thinks he has as good a chance of Succeeding as any other—however I should not be So very eaSy if I was of his opi-
nion.
As
til
CHARLES
. As my Lord Woodland and I were diScourfing the other day, he told me that he hoped, provided I should prove to be Sophia’s choice, which he did not much doubt would be the caSe, I should have no objedtion to , put an addition to my name.
Not immediately comprehending his meaning, I replied:
“ Should I be So fortunate to have “ Such an event take place, I shall “ always be proud of complying with your Lordship’s wishes.”


«« Why, aye, young man, that may do very well—but I do not think

I
It
CHARLES.
23
it would be any thing improper ‘‘ Sor the hushand of my daughter to have the word Sir prefixed to his
a
“ name—and as I understand that
0
you have an undoubted right to it
“ I cannot perceive any reaSbn why
“ we should strive to conceal Sronx

‘‘ This goodneSs is too much—the “ attention and' Service of my future life will be but a poor return for “ Such an unexampled fund of gene-

“ Think

24
CHARLES.
“ Think not, Mr. Trevor, I mean
“ to infinuate that I shouldi)e against

“ your tinion provided you had not a ‘‘ title, for I assure you I do not—but as we live in an age that is guided by appearances stis as well to acquieSce
irC
CC
V when we have it in our power.”
In vain did I attempt to expreSs my gratitude, for the moment I began he interrupted me in my acknowledgments, and afked if it was not for his own credit to fupport his daughter’s happineSs, and whether I did not think it was a duty incumbent on every man to fulfil his trust; therefore, if I agreed to thoSe tw©
interrogatories, I must confeSs he had
\
but
C tt A K L E S.

little merit to boast for what he did, as he looked upon himSelf to be no
more than an agent placed by Divine Providence to distribute the benefits of this life, therefore every worthy man had an equal right to his share how expanded, my friend, are the general opinions of this family.
I cannot form the least idea who it can be that has been making^
O

made of it!—but as I am pretty near your way of thinking there needs at
preSent no farther proof of its veracity.
When I received your letter I was quite low Spirited, therefore your lively rhapSody could not have come at a more SeaSonable time.
All my little Scheme to be Sent into the country is come to nothing; for just as I had began to alarm Sir Richard, this plaguy Sir William Freeman discontinued his familiarity in the family, calling but Seldom, and
then

then behaving very distant—I Sancy Lady Fanny and he have had a disagreement, Sor she does So bounce about—wliat has been the occaSion of it I at cannot preSent tell.
Yet were I not certain there is no room for any Such Suspicion, I shoud almost imagine her ladyship was jealous of me, and what leads me into this is, as they were fitting the other day by thcmSelves I chanced to go into the room and as I entered I heard her Say :

Dear Will,
W

quences, the Sooner it is put a stop
i
to the better.
Charles has been apprehended Sor a highwayman, and the gentleman has Sworn to the identity oS his per-Son—now, though we are thoroughly Satisfied within ourSelvcs of his innocence, yet, nevertheless, as we cannot bring any proof of his not being guilty, we are rendered incapable of doing him any Service—he and Sir. Harry Bowler had been out for a ride, when, as ill luck would have it, one
of his horfe’s shoes got loofc, which
obliged him to stop at a farrier’s while Sir Harry came on, and the
next tidings we had of him was of
t
his

his being taken into custody and this robbery laid to his charge.
Neither Sir Harry or I could prevail on the magistrate to grant him
his liberty, although we both offered
%
to be bound for his appearance when called for—I am under no apprehension, should it come to the worst,
I
but that I could make Sufficient interest to have the caSe fairly represented to his Majesty, in whoSc breast mercy is ever, predominant, and by
that means prevent his Suffering an
#
ignominious death—but, poor fellow! how will the corroding throes of anguish prey on his generous mind if that should be his lot.

to
To prevent which I entreat you uSe all possible means to find out the perSon who has accuScd him—^his name is WilSon, and he lives in one of the streets that comes into Pall Mall, but which I cannot rightly tell—If you have the fucceSs to find shim, exert all the perSuafion you are master of to prevail on him to mitigate this affair—should you perceive the least glimpSe of its being in the power of money I beg you will not let that be wanting, for I could wish,

at all events, to hinder its coming to a trial, as whether guilty or innocent he could not then expedt to meet with much favour from the cenSorious
world.

Sir Harry imagines he has Some distant knowledge of the perSon, and
has kindly offered to come to Lon-

We had propoSed to be in town Some day this week, and had prepared every thing for our journey, which would certainly have been but for

this

this unlucky mistake, as I can look
on it in no other light, but his being mistaken for Some other perSon—and
WilSon, I SuppoSe, is Some obstinate, unSeeling wretch who is reSolved that Somebody shall Suffer for his loSs.
You cannot imagine what a me*
iancholy gloom it has Spread through
our whole houSe—my Lord and Lady,
whenever his name is mentioned, can Scarcely refrain from tears—frequently
do they lament the haidship of his cafe, and the anguish of mind which he of courSc roust feel—he is a'' great favourite of their’s—indeed we all began to look on him as the intended
hushand of our Sophia, who, poor
girl!

Had I not been led on for this long time back with the continued expectation oS coming to town, you would, ere this, have been made acquainted with my Sentiments on your present mode oS liSe, but as I thought a verbal disapprobation of your const u6l would stand a better chance of taking effedl than all the writing in the world, I deferred from time to

Dear George,

has hitherto Succeeded beyond my most Sanguine hopes, and have no-doubt but it will prove in the end all we can wish.
I have been very buSy in perSuading this Samily that I am extremely Sorry for Trevor, and under that mash have had an opportunity, now and then, to throw out Some ambiguous hints, and was very near, one time, of going the wrong fide the post—for after I had been expatiating on his many good qualities
and the unlikelihood of his being guil--ty of Such a crime, notwithstanding all which I remarked it was very hard to anSwer for any but ourSelves,-
and if there had not been Something
in

in it I could Scarcely think any pcr-Son could be So void of reaSon as to Swear thus pofitively as Mr. WilSoa had done.
“ Do you really think So, Sir “ Harry?”—returnedMr. ThompSon.
“ Why, Mr. ThompSon, I should “ be very Sorry to harbour the least “ idea to the prejudice of Mr. ‘‘ Trevor; but you most allow, Sir, “ that it is impossible for any per-

‘‘ No matter. Sir,, what he was, I am certain that is his preSent Situation.”
Upon which I pull’d in as I found it would not do to attack him upon the head of neceshty—but how the devil he came by it I cannot imagine, for I have traced him to where he Served his clerkship, and cannot learn that he ever had any possession, but yet I think Thompfon must be pretty certain, or he never would have So politively asserted it.

how much he has been wrong’d.

As I was riding with Sir Harry Bowler one of my horSc’s shoes got looSe—I stopped at a farrier’s accordingly, to have it fastened, while Sir Harry went gently on—when it was finished I followed, and rode pretty brissdy to overtake him—but before I could gain the 1-cast fight of Sir Harry I observed three men riding very fast towards me, and they no Sooner got up with me, then one cried out, —“That’s the villain.

I could not deviSe their meaning, but they Suffered me but a short time to remain ignorant, for two of them came immediately to Seize me—upon their approaching, perceiving their intent, I begged they would uSe no violence as I was ready to attend them wherever they pleaSed.

hear a man who, to the best of my

from

By the interference of the other gentleman and the mentioning Lord Woodland, whofe name he repeated, he at last agreed, and I immediately dispatched a messenger to Mr. ThompSon, acquainting him with my Situation.

CHARLES TREVOR,
My dearest Charles,
W ILL you not be Surprised at
hearing oS my being in London ?—I have been here almost three weeks and have but just learnt where you are, or I should have Sent to you before—notwithstanding the numerous places of entertainment and the number
C H A R L E

ber of rarities, in this great town, yet I think they would not have had charms enough to inSpirc me with
the least defire of vifiting them
but
wshen MiSs Bartlec kindly made me the offer, as fire was coming on a
viSit, could I refuSe So favourable an opportunity, which I flattered my-Self would be the cafe, of fpending Some little time with my dear Charles ?
therefore, as my coufins were not in the least averSe to my coming, I accepted her invitation with a deal of pi eaSure.
How was I difappointed on my arrival, when I could neither fee, or gain the least intelligence where you

was to be Sound—I was terribly alarmed by the account I received from the perSon where you lived for was I to be deprived of you I should be an orphan indeed—hitherto by the tenderneSs of my couSins and your brotherly affedbion, I have had little cauSe to regret the lofs of thoSe parents whom I fcarcely knew Altho* I have always been treated by Mr. Dawfon as his own child, yet if you was gone, to whom So candidly could I confeSs my little failings ? for you, even when most you chide, are always the tender, loving brother; partial to his Maria’s errors, and ever willing to commend her little iiierits; your advice is dictated by
love.

love, and your friendship far exceeds the common tie of nature—if ever I am proud, my dear Charles, it will be of being thought worthy your good opinion.
I should have Sent you word of my intended journey, but it was Settled in a hurry, and 1 pleaSed mySelf with the thoughts of Surprifingyou by my appearance—but, alas ! how was I decei ved.
If you can make it convenient to come to town before I return, which I believe will be in a few days, I shall be happy, for I long to See you CouSins DawSon were all well when I left them, and MiSs Bartlet
fends her compliments to you, while I,

Mr. ThompSon, what’s that to you : But have a little patience, my dear boy, and you shall hear all—Hold hold, hold—before I begin I must inform you that I am in a fair way of fucceSs with my little fmiling Maria—admitted whenever I call, and they affure me they think them-Selves honoured by my company yet I can’t get the little gipfey to stay with me alone—MiSs Bartlet is afways Sure to be of the party

TO THE

T is all over, ThompSon ! the murder’s out, and I am in a very pretty dilemma—here have I been fluttering round the fiame till my wings are fairly Scorch’d—I must needs go capering after a pair of black eyes, with a plague to it—but as I have beerr
caught in my own Snare it is no more
than
C M A R L t S.

than just that I should be made to Suffer for it.
I SuppoSe I shall meet with but little favour from your quarter—it is true I ought not to exped any, but then, as our immortal bard Says “ the leSs I deServe the more merit is “ your bounty”—and you certainly have SenSe enough to make the most of -a good adion—but to be Serious and yet how was I to know that she was Charles’ Sister—“-Who was “ Charles’ Sister —Why no other than my little bewitching Maria the very girl I have been So full of my anticks with.

Nay now, ThompSon, clear up that clouded brow oS thine, Sot when once you begin to Sro-wn, or look grave, I know it is all over with me it is in your friendship I confide to get my folly excuSed—procure me a pardon from the lovely Maria, with the continuation of Trevor’s esteem, and then, with pleaSure, will I Submit to whatever restridlions you shall think proper to inssidt.

accomplish my defigns, and my defire growing stronger every day, I thought it highly necessary to leave the place, not doubting but the first fair face, and the conversation of my friends,
would totally eradicate this growing
evil

165
\
evil—but egad I was quite mistaken, for it w^as not in the pov/er of all the charms at, and pleaSures of, Woodland-hall to drive her from my thoughts; in fa(st, they were rather cncreaSed, by Seeing you So happy in the love of your amiable Harriet Comparison frequently made me dull Sometimes, being up to my ears in love, I was for returning, and, at all
events, making her mine, but Pride would then reSume her Seat and picture Such an a6l as downright mad-neSs—At length I reSolved to try what essicacy there might be in ttie variety of town and left you for no other reaSon.
Where,
166
CHARLES.
Where, having arrived, and poS-Sessing a tolerable share of gaiety, or folly, which ever you plcaSe to call it, in my composition, and meeting with opportunities to give full Scope to my talents, I was pretty eaSy, and Soon became, as I thought, the willing stave of Lady Fanny Story but even then, as you may have Seen
I
the cloud in an April day glide before the Sun, So would Maria dart acroSs nny mind and cast a trariSient damp-steSs o’er my greatest joys.
Judge then what were my feelings
on meeting with her ih a polite cir-

blazing, in her native charms, with rcSpiendent lustre o’er the painted crowd...yet, notwithstanding I was
thus SenSible of her Superiority, and pined to posscSs her, I could not think of taking her oh honourable terms, but reSolved to gratify my vicious passions and rob her of her blooming innocence.
_	t
The meafures I purSued to get into her company you have been already acquainted with, and it would be mere repetition to reilate them, therefore I shall proceed to the day in which I was So confoundedly abashed that it will be Some time e’er I

I went, as uSual, to wait on the ladies, and Sound.

my disappointment, that had it been

If I was Surprised at Seeing him, what must my conScernation be at, the moment I drew my Sword, her flying to him, shrieking out—“ Oh ! “ my Charles ! my Charles !” and fainting in his arms—JealouSy immediately took possession of my Soul, and I could freely have stabb’d them both for the preference I imagined, from her exclamation, she gave him.

yet, in
vours to shade his failings, the preSent cafe, am I entirely at a loSs to find an excuSefor his invidious atternpt^—indeed he Seeks not to palliate his fault, but freely owns it,, and yields himSelf v/holly to the clemency of his judge—You are that judge, and I have no fear but you will prove a partial one, considering him
in the light of a friend.
From

From a highneSs oS Spirit, induL gence of youth, and an amazing volatility in his disposition, has he been

heartily ashamed of, and will leave no method untry’d to make atonement for what he has done.
’Tis almost imposhble that I^ove, that great refiner of the foul! should prove an accessary in destroying the eternal happineSs of the defired ob-jedt—and yet he pofitively asserts it is Solely from ardour of his passion he has purSued your fister—Pride, I doubt not, has had her share in offering: the

me council in his cauSc,. and as I am SenSible of my not being Logician enough to prove that there was' no crime in what he has committed, I must reSisn the office and Submit it entirely

*Tis Some conSolation, my dear Charles, to See my friends enjoy that happineSs which I am debarred of-3carce have I left a fingle gleam of hope that Harriet, my amiable Harriet ! ever will be mine—my heart is depressed, all the flattering joys I had formed to experience in our

If you can Sparc an hour while you remain in town, contrive to See her, as I then may have Some intelli-;ence—mark every movement, every look, or your going will be of little Service—for there is nought So inqui Sitive as the distant lover.

Another reaSon I have to urge your Speedy return is, that by having you with us we might then be allowed to introduce Some other Subjedt, for at preSent you are the never-ending topic of every conversation—whenever we meet there appears to be a

In this manner may I write, but you, I Hatter mySelf, are too well

acquainted with my diSpofition to SuSpc<51: me of putting Such an adi in force—I can affure you my uneafmefs was excessive on my Surprizing Sir William Freeman in an attempt So unv/orthy to himfeJf and disgraceful to me—Altlioygh I thought myfdf So highly inSulted, I meant not to purSue him for Satisfaction, but in-
t
tended to leave him to the corroding stings of Seff-eonvidion.
Of this resolution did your letter deprive me, and I found mySclf bound by all the ties of gratitude to forgive an offence that the heat of
youth

CHARLES.
youth alone had been the cauSe of, and to embrace that return of friendship which was offered me, and by which I was So much honoured But this was not to be done at once, as your letter informed me I was not the only perfon concerned—the Situation of my Maria’s heart was to be consulted ’ere I could attempt to begin the treaty—this required both time and observation, but, however,
rccolledling that, had it not been for your little device, I should not perhaps, have been So acquainted with Sophia’s esteem, therefore I looked on it for certain that to alarm her in a fimilar manner wmuld be the quickest and Surest way of coming
at

at the truth oS her Sentiments concerning him.
For this purpoSe, taking a proper opportunity, I introduced Sir William’s	name—enquired where
and how she had became acquainted
X
with him, and what was his beha-viour at that time—theSe questions naturally led us to his offering the inSult, which on being fiightly mentioned I affedted an air of indifference, and assured her there was no danger of his ever attempting Such an adl again—-She appeared astonished at my manner ; and heSitatingly ashed me what I meant—Still keeping up
the appearance I had assumed, I Said,
it

CHARLES.
it was no great matter as he was now gone where he must expedl: to anSwer for all he had committed here—at that instant the colour forSook her cheek, a paleneSs o’erSpread her face and she Sunk lifeleSs on the chair.
I was not much Surprized at this change, becauSc I expedled there would be Something of the kind, provided Sir William had any interest with her—upon which account I patiently waited for her returning Spirits, without applying for any assistance—When she was partly come to hcrSelf I enquired what affedled her, but could get no anfwer but that she was taken Suddenly ill—I
then.
CHARLES.

then, in a kind of' angry tone, exclaimed against him as the cauSe, and she immediately burst into a stood of tears—this was too plain to deSire any farther proof, and I began
• j
to Sooth, and uSe every argument that I could think of to restore her to her tranquility again.
When she understood what I had been aiming at, she confessed the Secret palpitations in her breast arid made me a confidant in all its Secret wishes. I wasi far frorn being difpleaSed at her ready confession of the Situation of her heart, instantly confidering it as an indissoluble knot to our triple bond of friendship.

Lady SOPHIA THOMPSON,

Some of the best kind oS news Sor me—we are to leave this place di-re<stly,^ and once again return to the

I care but little for the cauSe of this Sudden change in Sir Richard, being So much delighted with the effe(5l—however, as you may have Some curioSity to be acquainted with the occaSion, thus then it was.
As I^ady Fanny, Sir Richard, and

I were fitting together I was greatly Surprized at the Servant’s announcing the entrance of Sir William Freeman, nor was it lessened on perceiving Mr, Trevor, Sir Charles I mean, follow

It is necessary to acquaint you,, before I proceed any farther, that we had been informed Sir William was on the point of marriage—her Ladyship was- greatly piqued at not being able t® diScover the Lady oV his- choice, and just at the moment of their entry was she inveighing; bitterly against him, as one of the most vile and defigning of men..

appearance of the very man who was the Subjedt of our conversation, and that no way to his advantage—He apologized to her for his intrufion, which he Said he should not have
been guilty of,, but as his friend had cxprcstcd a great defire to See MiSa Stretton, to know if she had any commands to Wood land-hall, he took the liberty to accompany him and, hoped she would pardon his prefumption—Without paying any attention to his fine Speech, she gave Sir Charles a very polite reception but this [no way diSconcerted him, who with his uSual confidence, took a Scat cloSe by her, and every time she attempted to addreSs herSelf to

CHARLES.

Sir Charles, he was Sure to interrupt her—At length, perceiving he appeared to be Sully determined to engroSs the attention of her and Sir Richard, she returned his gay Sallies with that lively Spirit of which she poffeffes Such an abundant share, while Sir Charles and I were left to our own private diScourSe—the Subjedt of which, perhaps, if you take Some little pains you might be enabled to gueSs—^He is indeed a most agreeable man, and of all I am acquainted with the m.ost deServing my Sophia ; yet, notwithstanding all his qualifications I do not perceive he appears a jot the worSe for his amazing turn of fortune—may Heaven grant you

In about an hour they leSt uj, and Sir Richard attended them to the door—during his abSence Lady Fanny and I remained Silent, and I
I perceived Something of diSpleaSure hanging on her brow,
but he took care the moment he came back to put an end to our filence, and began before the door was Scarcely shut, with—“ Why, Lady “ Fanny, Sure theSe vrere uncxpedled

Dcjeded as I was by the plauSiblc tale which she had invented, yet did I receive a gleam of joy from his last words, and my only fear was that she would perfuade him from his resolution—.As Soon as he was gone I left her Ladyship and retired to my own room, without attempting to disprove the least particle of what she had afferted.
On his return I found, if any
thing, he was more
poSitivc than

before—but, however, it being latc' he was prevailed on to defer his journey still the morning—he had met with Sir William, who did not deny
a Syllable of the charge—what could

be his reaSon Sor Submitting to be thus falSely SuSpe£led, I can’t imagine—though, indeed, it makes but little odds to him, when he is in the humour, what you lay to his charge.

I don’t think mySelf in So much danger as I should have done on account of your Harriet’s being with you, or at least in the neighbourhood and that, is pretty ne.ar;:the Same thing—-Wriat an unaccountable being her old genilehian is !—I Sup-

the most strange manner accuSed me oS having a defign to run away with his daughter—I was rather conSound-ed at first but on his mentioning he wobld take her back to prevent my accomplishing any Such defign, the thought struck me that it might prove oS Some advaritage to you if I owned the charge—accordingly,
without hefitation, I told him I was
«
greatly Surprized at his having discovered what I had taken So much pains to conceal, but fince it was So
4
k would be needleSs to deny that he knew my intention—I was well assured, from the many diSre^pedlful things he shad frequently Said of me, that
4t would be fruitless to attempt to

gain his conScnt, and I was Sully reSolved at all events to have her, nor would I give over my purSuits while she remained in a finglc state his moving her into the country would be of no effedt, for if he carried her to the end of the world he might depend on it I would follow them.
This avowed difreSpedl to his parental authority, quite diSconcerted the old gentleman, and he remained for Some moments without uttering a Syllable—at length being partly come to himSelf he declared he would Sooner have her married to a plowman than to Such an impudent rake-hell as me—my assurance was beyond
what-

€ H A R L E S.
217
whatever he had Seen or heard—he would immediately return home load his biunderbuSs, and if ever he caught me near his houSe he would shoot me as Sure as I was alive.
He then left me, and 1 was not a little delighted at the adventure and the panic I had put the whimSical old fellow in—I have fince been in-formed that he adually Set off yesterday morning for the country, the veracity of which by this time you •are able to determine.
I have received a note from Lady Fanny Story, full of upbraidings for Some of my past condudl, and in
VoL, II,
L
which
21 8

which she likewise forbids my ever entering again within her doors—I have certainly played the fool there more than became me, btit still, would it not have been carrying it to a much greater length had I married her and at the Same time Seijfibic of the preference I gave Maria.
W
If a fincere contrition for my past follies will be any atonement I shall yet be clear, for I am fully reSolved to follow your example, to
Leave the wild wanton for the fober plan.
And, like my friend, become the modeft man.

Its preSent inhabitants, to'yourSelf, Sor I intend coming and laying in my claim for a share—I should nbt have permitted tliem to have left me behind, but as I flatter mySelf Maria has no objedion to become mine,' I was reSolved to have every thing prepared before I left town, that there might be no excuSe for delaying my happinefs.
I could wish you would take upon yourSelf to Speak to Sir- Charles, that he might not embarraSs himfelf, with reSped to a portion for Maria
•
tell him as I am already in possfeffion

of a Sufficiency, I am fully reSolved, on no account whatever, to take a

Single shilling, and I shall think if they offer it, that they are not willing I should do my endeavour to make amends for the diSreSpedl I have already offered her—you arc as well acquainted that my fortune wants no addition as I am mySelf, therefore I shall depend on your interference to prevent any one being offered.
All the preliminaries being adjusted I shall mount my fiery PegaSus, and fly to the Paphian Grove, for the ambrofial groves of Woodland-hall must be equally delightful while they contain one far more beauteous than Beauty’s Qtieen : When Plea-

My dear NclSon,

X N the name of all the inhabitants
of Woodland-hall do I request you: to come hither—Can you refuSe wsheu I affure you it is your preSence alone that is wanting to make my happ.i-neSs complete !—I will accept of ncK excuSe for your delay, therefore I
expect
A.
CHARLES.

expect you will comply with my request, as I am certain you would not wish to check the delight of your Charles.
My Sriend ThompSon is likewiSe in poffeffion of all his heart can wish Sir Richard' Stretton has gave his conSent, and Harriet’s love will reward his constancy—This Sudden turn was partly occaSioned by Sir William Freeman, we will acquaint you in what manner when you are with us.
Mr. Thompson when he heard
p
that Sir Richard was returned went to pay his compliments to him, and
L 4	the
e H A R t E S,
the old gentleman received him witff more Samiliarity than he had been accustomed to for Some time—His love prompted him to take advantage of this Seeming good temper, and
urge his unabated passion for the amiable Harriet—This he did with Succefs, for. Sir Richard confented to
f
their union in the following whim* Sical manner :
“ Look’ee,, Mr, ThompSon, aL “ though I never had any great ob-“ jedtion to your having my daugh-“ ter, yet I should not even now. “ give you my conSent were, I not “ under Some apprehenfion that that, y licentious Scoundrel, Sir William;-

He came home in that fullneSs of fpirits which it may cafily be fup-
poSed his reception had given him,
/
and acquainted us with all that had happened—this was an addition to
our
226
C H A R L E <r.
our felicity that we could not have the most distant idea of, and our joy on the occaSion was viSible in every countenance.
.. *
My Lord Woodland," that every
thing might
be properly Settled, waited on Sir Richard, yesterday, liimSelf, and returned with him and Harriet in his coach—but judge at the old gentleman’s SurpriSe, when the first perSon he Saw at Woodland-hall was no other than Sir William Freeman, who had just alighted; he appeared greatly agitated and was for returning home immediately, which he certainly would have done
had

‘had not Sophia contrived to get Harriet out of the room.
However, after Some little time," my Lord and Mr. Sommcrville pre-^ vailed on him to be Somewhat pacified, when Sir William alked his pardon for the freedom he had taken and Solemnly declared he had no deSigns on MiSs Strettor^, but con-
I
feffed to him the Sole rcaSon for his not contradidting that charge, and as a proof of which he assured them his affedtions was irremoveably fixed on Maria, and that the being united to her was the extent of his wishes.
This-

This had So good an affeT on Ste Richard that he took him by the hand and declared he was an honest fellow after all—and that as what he
had done was merely out of friendship to Mr. Thompson he freely for-* gave
The three old gentlemen and Lady Woodland then formed themSelves into a kind of committee, the reSolves of which were that our marriages should all be consummated at the Same time, and we have freely consented to their fixing and ordering;

Now then is the period almost
