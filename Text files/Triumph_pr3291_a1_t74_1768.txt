About eight o’clock sh a fine evening in July, as Mr. Brereton was walking with his family in the garden adjoining to his houSe, which was Situated in one of the most pleaSant villages near London, the arrival of Mr. Wallace, the only Son of an old friend of that gentleman’s, being announced by his Servant, he hastened to receive him; and Soon afterwards, having brought him into the garden, preSented him to his daughters.—So friendly a reception gave Mr. VoL.

Wallace uncommon pleaSure, though he had Some reaSon to expe(st it from the intimacy which had Subsisted between his father and Mr. Brereton. As disappointments of that nature, however, are not unfrequent, from the uncertainty of all human friendships, he was extremely glad to sind that his father had not discovered any want of penetration in recommending him So strongly.
Mr. Brereton had been an eminent counsellor; and as Mr. Wallace’s father designed him for the bar, he thought it might be greatly in his friend’s power not only to give his Son proper advice, but alSo to facilitate his progreSs in the law.— Reasonably indeed did old Mr. Wallace conjedlure that his friend would employ all his interest in his Son’s favour, and make himfelf Serviceable to him by the exertion of his faculties; but the amiable qualities and extensive accomplishments of young Wallace, Soon convinced Mr. Brereton that Such accomplish-, mentsand Such qualities would Sufficiently enable him to shine in his profession,with-out his assistance.

Mr. Brereton, upon a nearer acquaintance with his young friend’s principles and parts, disposition and capacity, felt increasing reSpedl and esteem for him ; and found So much pleaSure in his conversation, that he could not bear to think of his departure.—Whenever he talked of occupying chambers in the Temple, in which he was to fettle at the beginning of winter, Mr. Brereton insisted upon his coming down to him as often as his avocations would permit him, urging the diSagreeableneSs of a town situation to a man in his ill state of health.—He alSo made him promiSe to devote all his leii-Sure moments to him.
Wallace was very ready to promiSe a compliance with Mr. Brereton’s earnest intreaties, becauSe he was well-assured of finding in him a Sincere friend, an able instrudor, and an agreeable companion.
While theSe two gentlemen were every day becoming more amiable in each other’s eyes, the fine perfon, elegant accomplishments, and polite addreSs of the younger, were not over-looked by the la-

dies of the family, the two MiSs Brere-tons, and an intimate acquaintance of theirs who was come to Spend a few weeks with them.	,
As Mr. Brereton had lost his wife about three years before, the eldest of his daughters, who was about threC“and-twenty. Superintended his domestic affairs, and did the honours of his table with a Spirit and propriety which not only gave him the highest Satisfadion, but rendered every movement in his family agreeable to the company whom he choSe to invite; and his guests were numerous, as he had a plentiful fortune, was a warm lover of Society, and of a generous hofpitable temper.
MiSs Brereton was tall, and had a fair complpxipn : her features were not perfedly regular, but were extremely attractive; she had a pair of the finest black eyes imaginable, in which,when they were not under the influence of tlie tender passions, there was a dazzling brilliancy, but into which she could, at pleasure, throw a languishing SoftneSs, and by So doing make them doubly bewitching;
her
Mr. WALLACE. 5
her noSe was aquiline; her mouth was pleaSyigly formed, and the colour of her hair vras a dark cheSnut.
MiSs CeciliaBrereton was near five years younger than her sister, and very different from her in her perSon. She was much Shorter, but gracefully proportioned.— She was not a complete beauty, but had Such a naivete in her appearance, fuch an expreshon of genuine innocence and openneSs of heart beamed, at first sight, in her countenance, that she pleaSed you before you was aware of her powders, and gained lovers as fast as her Sister captivated admirers.—Her complexion was of . a polished whiteneSs, and animated with the glow of health: her eyes were of a bright blue, and her hair auburn : to finish her portrait, innumerable graces dimpled round her mouth whenever she Spoke or Smiled, which discovered great fweetneSs of disposition, and a strong desire to give pleaSure to all who beheld her.
Maria Brereton struck you at the first glance of your eye, by the majestic dignity of her air; Cecilia charmed you by
B 3	the
5	The HisTORy of
the delicacy and by the Simplicity of her manners. Maria awed her beholders by the grandeur in her mien ; Cecilia allured them by an irresistible Somewhat which they Scarce knew how to deScribe ; and the majority of thoSe who were at first sight struck with the figure of the former, shook off her chains, and became voluntary vassals to the almost imperceptible but increasing power of the latter.
The young lady their friend and companion, was Mists Myers, who, though not a beauty, was a very agreeable woman; she was therefore a particular favourite of MiSs Brereton’s, in whoSe eyes she did not appear the leSs So, from the marks which the Small-pox had left upon her face.
Perpetually Surrounded by three Such girls, Wallace must have been Something more or leSs than man to have kept his heart, especially as they were all thoroughly Sensible of his merit, and as each preferred him Secretly to any man they had ever Seen.—His perSon, indeed, was So remarkably pleasing, that if their inclinations had been engaged, they could
not
Mr. W A L L A C E. ,7
not have looked at him with total indifference.—He was of a good stature, and in his well-proportioned figure, strength and grace were equally conlpicuous. His face was oval, covered with a roSy bloom, which is not often Seen among our young men of fashion. — His eyes, teeth and hair, the last of which was of a fine light cheSnut, gave lustre to his whole appearance. To heighten his at-traflions, he was ntodestly majeSde in his carriage, and discovered in every part of his behaviour uncommon proofs of delicacy and diScernment.
The father of Mr. Wallace was the younger Son of an antient and honourable houSe in the North of England, and had been bred to the study of physic ; a study which he pnrSued with fucceSs enough to maintain his family, consisting of two daughters besides this Son, genteelly; but the emoluments of his profession were not Sufficient to enable him to lay up fortunes for his children, as he was determined at all events to provide, if possible, for a wife whom he most af-fedionately loved and revered on account of her many virtues, particularly her doll 4	mestic
S	The Historv of
mestic ceconomy, by which, far exceed*-ing his expedations, he had been in a situation to Send his only Son to GlaSgow to complete his studies.—From GlaSgow young Wallace had not been long abSent when he appeared at Mr. Brereton’s, having only Spent little more than a fortnight at his father’s before he Set off for London and its environs.
Young Wallace -was not a gay man, neither was he what is generally called a gallant man ; his behaviour among women was, however, perfedly eaSy and agreeable, especially among women of
education.---Looking upon the MiSs
Breretons a-s the daughters of a man who had shewn So much esteem for him, and who had it in his power tq be alfo of much fervice to him, he treated them with the utmost politeneSs and the pro-foundest reSped: MiSsMyers too, as she was their intimate, had -lier share of his complaisance ; but never did he Suffer his complaisance to carry him beyond the bounds of the most consummate discretion, though his situation with the ladies in the Same houSe occasioned an unavoidable interchange of little innocent familiarities :
Mr. WALLACE. ^
liarities :—all the ladies behaved to him with great condeScenfion, but each of them distinguished herSelf by a peculiar behaviour.
During his stay at Mr. Brereton’s, he received a letter from a young man of fashion with whom he had contradted a particular intimacy at College, to let him know that he was come to town, and to desire his company for a few days.
As he perceived that neither Mr.Brere-ton nor the ladies were willing to let him leave them, before his departure was demanded by duty, he freely communicated the contents of his letter in order to evince the necessity of his removal. To theSe contents the old gentleman replied, “ My houSe is your home at preSent: you “ have no other: invite yOurfriend, there-‘‘ fore, to come hither, when he is tired of “ the pleasures of the town, which are not “ very numerous at this time of the year, “ and then you will be under no tempta-^ tions to leave me.*’ ‘

Mr. Wallace, with a reSpedlful po-liteneSs, would have excufedhimSelf from taking Such a liberty; but as Mr. Brere-ton would not hear of any objedlions to his propofal, he Set out for London, determined to adt in obedience to it.
On the morning of his departure, Maria very warmly Seconded her father in urging his quick return, about which MiSs Myers with an affeded air expressed the Same Sollicitude, while Cecilia Said little, but by the SeriouSnteSs of her aS-pedl, and the blushes which crimfoned her fair face, when her father rallied he? upon her indifference concerning his favourite’s journey to London (as he frequently called Wallace), shewed that she was not leSs affedled by it.—As to him, having hot So much vanity in his composition as half the young fellows in town are poffeffed of, and not being really in love with either of them, he rode away with a chearfulnefs which proved incon-testibly the tranquility of his heart.
Upon his meeting Sir Edward Rufsiy at the place appointed, he informed him
of
Mr. WALLACE. ii
of Mr.Brereton’s invitation, and told him alSo that he might possibly be in Some danger, as there were Seldom to be found in one fansily three more agreeable girls,
“ And to which of the three,” replied Sir Edward, “ does your fancy lead you ? “ I afk this previous question, becauSe I “ would not willingly, if I should be en-“ chanted, interfere with my friend in an affair which often is attended with con-“ Sequences fatal to the firmest connexions. “ —The most Solidfriendships have been weakened, have been totally destroyed, “ by the clashing of rival claims.”
“To neither of them,” Said Wallace,' “ does my fancy lead me; my preSent “ situation in life will not permit me to “ think Serioufiy, with prudence, about “ any woman: women of fortunes, as “ the MiSs Breretons are, will very ra-“ tionally look above me; and I should “ therefore deem it madneSs to employ “ my thoughts upon a woman without “ one, till 1 had a Sufficiency to make “ her happy.—^You have therefore, my “ free leave. Sir Edward, to chuSe ei-“ ther of the ladies, and my best wishes

Wallace, having Spent a few days in town, returned to Mr. Brereton, and, according to his desire, introduced Sir Edward to him, who was most cordially received as the friend of Mr. Wallace.
As Sir Edward RuSsly was very pleasing in his perSon, and engaging in his addrefs, the addition of his company was by no means diSagreeable to the family.—The five young people therefore, with Mr. Brereton, who headed their parties. Spent their time in the various amuSements which the Society of a plea-Sant little village, and the last Smiles of a fine autumn afforded them.
In the midst of thoSe amuSements their peace was in Some meaSure interrupted by the arrival of Mr. Monfon, the Son of an old friend of Mr. Brereton’s, who had, before he went to make the tour of Europe, been engaged by the conSent of the two fathers, and his own inclination, to MiSs Brereton.
This
Mr. W A L L A C E.	i ^
This young gentleman had been extremely struck with the commanding perSon and great vivacity of Maria; and would have married her before he left England; but as he -met with a strong opposition from both sides, he was obliged to be contented with a Solemn. promiSe that she should be his at his return : and it was his passion for her which occasioned that return Sooner than it was expedted.
When he came down to Mr. Brere-ton’s, it was natural to imagine that he should discover all the ardor of a lover who had long been abSent from the miS-treSs of his wishes: and he did, indeed, _fiy to her arms with the utmost impatience.—But, whether he was damped by the remarkable coldnefs with which Maria received him, or whether he was animated by the winning behaviour of Cecilia, who treated him with the innocent familiarity of a Sister, certain it is, that he felt an almost instantaneous change in his disposition with regard to the two ladies, and transferred his af-fedtion from the one to the other. As an abrupt avowal, however, of his new
Sen-
14 The History of
Sentiments might, he justly thought, defeat his designs, he with much ingenuity concealed them, only embracing every opportunity, when he was not obferved by the rest of the family, to pay all imaginable attention to Cecilia; and he regulated his carriage with So much dexterity, that she could not well be offended with it, as it appeared rather to expreSs the esteem of a brother than the affiduityof a lover.—MiSs Cecilia, stis true, had So little vanity, and was So entirely taken up with attending to the merit ol Mr. Wallace, that she had not the faintest ideas of the real motives by which Mr. MonSon’s behaviour to her was actuated.—Not So blind was MiSs Brereton ; she immediately discerned the Sudden and violent alteration in Mr. MonSon: it wounded her pride to See her lover SaithleSs, and to fee her sister, whom she looked upon as far interior to her in perSonal charms, preferred; but she would not have been So much hurt, if any other woman had engaged a man who had never been the objedt of her inclination. DiSagreeable, however, as the visible change in his fen-timents concerning her was, as she plumed herSelf upon the Superiority of
her
Mr, WALLACE. 15
her beauty, she winked at it, on account of Mr. Wallace, who, from their first acquaintance, had charmed her.
Monfon proceeded with the utmost caution, lest jealouly should instigate MiSs Brereton to ruin himSelf in Cecilia’s eyes, before he had by imperceptible gradations made himSelf master of her heart, over which he hoped, from the SweetneSs of her temper, and the opportunities which she innocently and un-deSignedly gave him. Soon to triumph. Cecilia alSo was the more ready to listen to him, and to join the parties of pleasure which he formed, as Wallace almost always assisted at them ; for whom MonSon too conceived a prodigious eS-teem: not that she was, at first. Sensible herSelf that she had So great a predilection for Wallace, but she felt an involuntary desire to be always near him. If they walked out, she was generally by his side, without thinking how she came in that situation: if she danced, she always gave her hand with more alacrity to him than to any other man; When they had little concerts, among
them-
i6 The History of
themSelves, she never failed to sing at his request, and to his accompaniment..
She had alSo drawn his portrait, when she only Sanded that she was tracing out upon her vellum the most amiable figure in the world,—Yet in the whole of her behaviour there was Such a modest sim*r plicity, that MonSon himSelf, who, as a, lover, should have been the most clearsighted, was deceived by it; but Maria, from her extreme partiality for Wallace, and. from keener penetration. Soon discovered what the innocence of her sister had concealed from her.—As she, however, had not been able, with the utmost stretch of her Sagacity, to diScover an equal passion in Wallace for Cecilia, " she watched him with redoubled vis:i-lance; keeping all her fuSpicions concerning Cecilia to herSelf, and only striving to make him as Sensible of her own power of pleasing as she was of his.
In conSequence of this plan, she fought every opportunity to attrad the attention of Wallace, who, having no attachment to her Sister, fell into her
Schemes

Mr. WALLACE. 17
‘Schemes with a promptitude which encouraged her to hope that she should mould him according to her wishes.
While Wallace, MonSon, and the MiSs Breretons, were thus employed. Sir Edward RuSsly and MiSs Myers were not idle: the former became, in a short time, violently enamoured with ^ Cecilia, and the latter with the large independant fortune of the baronet.
Sir Edward, penetrating deeply into . the views of his companions. Soon discovered, with infinite regret, the propensity of MiSs Cecilia Brereton to his Iriend: he perceived, indeed, nothing particular in the behaviour of W^allace to her to alarm him; but as he loved her with a tender and Sincere passion, he expedted, he dreaded every moment to hear that her attradtions either had Subdued or would Subdue a heart which was, he knew, poffeffed of the most delicate Sensibility. He was, therefore, continually talking of her, perpetually praiSmg her to him, in order to hear his replies, though he lived in' constant apprehensions that thole replies would
prove
i8	The HiSTORy of
prove fatal to his peace.—While he lavished his panegyrics, however, on the beauties of her perSon, and her intellectual attainments, and with much pathos lamented her indifference, he weighed his expressions with great nicety before he uttered them, that not one of them might give Wallace room to furmiSe that he himSelf appeared to her in a favourable point of view; but he was af-siduoussy earnest to make, Wallace believe that MiSs Erereton discovered in every part of her carriage a Strong inclination for him.—And yet, in Spite of his endeavours not to mention Cealia'’s partiality for his friend, lest the difclofure of it should excite similar feelings'in his bofom, the ardor of his passion Sometimes threw him off his guard. One day, in a moment of forgetfulneSs, he cried out, “ Oh! Wallace, would I were you!” —“ That’sanoddwish, methinks,SirEd-“ ward,” replied Wallace; who, while his friend was dying with love, was burning with an ambitious desire to raiSe his character, to acquire a fortune Sufficient to reward his father and mother for their tender care of him, and to place hjmSelf advantageously in the world.

Mr. W A L L A C E. 19
« Not at all,” Said Sir Edward ; you “ are So well received by the MiSs Brere-“ tons, and eSpecially by the lovely Ce-“ celia, becauSe you are So high in her fa-“ ther’s esteem, and for no other realbn I “ am perSuaded, that I would most glad-“ ly be in your place: possibly I might “ then be happy enough to make her “ Sensible of my ardent passion for « her.”
“ Your rank in life,” Said Wallace, “ your fortune, and your merit, added to the esteem of Mr. Brereton, of which “ you have no reaSon to entertain any “ doubts, will unquestionably. Sir Ed-“• ward, make all the impression you can “ wish on Mifs Cecilia’s heart.”
« Do not flatter me, Wallace; do not “ flatter me,—I shall never obtain So ‘‘desirable a blessing.—What is rank? “ what is fortune ? what is any thing “ compared to the love of that dear « girl?—Could I but make mySelf agree-“ able to her; had I but the siightest “ hopes of pleasing what my foul doats on, I should be happy !

“ Hold, hold, Wallace,” cried Sir Edward, interrupting him with impetuosity, “ you own then that you are in y love?”
“ I do, RuSsly,” most frankly, replied he, “ but not with Cecilia.”-—
“ A thouSand thanks for that declara-“ tion—I breathe again,” replied Sir Edward, “ and can infure your happinefs ‘‘ by a marriage with her sister Maria,
who adores you; by which marriage
“ you
Mr. WALLACE. 21
“ you will be enabled to carry your ge-“ nerous designs into execution, and fix “ your own felicity at the fame time. “ You deServe to be happy, and you may « be So.”
“ But I could not, I fear,” Said Wallace, “ enjoy felicity with Maria, were I mean “ enough to avail mySelS of her atten-“ tions to me, and by stealing the affec--• IC‘ tions of my friend’s child, make So baSe “ a return for the hoSpitable reception he “ has given me.—Befides, is she not en-“ gaged to Mr. MonSon ?”
“ She is,” Said Sir Edward, “ but they “ discover not the least love for each “ other.—She is as entirely attached to “ you, as he is to Cecilia. But Sup-“ poSe, my dear Wallace, that the lady “ is unable to be happy without you “ (and that is, I fee plainly, the caSe); “ and fuppoSe that Mr. Brereton, full of esteem and affedtion for his daugh« “ ter, should confent to your marriage, “ and give her an ample fortune, would ‘‘ not your happineSs be completed ?—
y No”.
22	The HisTORy of
« No,” Said Wallace—“ it would not
be completed.”
“ Then you must certainly love Ce-« cilia?”
‘‘ Not So neither.—Oh! RuSsly, why, “ why will you thus fret a wound which “ time nor reaSon have yet had power to « heal ?”
Sir Edward was So pleaSed to hear that his friend was not his rival, that he earnestly intreated him to open his heart freely, adding, that it might possibly be within the reach of his abilities to be as Serviceable to him as he wished to be. —“ But if I cannot, continued he, give “ you any assistance, let me, at least, “ have the Satisfadion of contributing “ by the exertion of my friendship to re-“ sieve the diSquietude with which your “ mind is oppreffed.—By the commimi-“ cation of your tender griefs you will “ certainly receive Some comfort. Do « not therefore, my dear Wallace, any “ longer refuSe me what I have Some y right to claim, your confidence.”
‘‘ That
Mr. WALLACE. 23
“ That you wish to See me happy, I firmly believe,” replied Wallace with a faint Smile; “ but that the diScloSure “ of the Sentiments which I have hitherto “ So Cautioussy concealed will tend to “ make me So, lam yet to learn.—But “ as I find you love MiSs Cecilia with a “ violence which will exclude eaSe till “ you are assured that I cannot be a com-“ petitor, know, RuSsly, that all-beau-“ tiful and amiable as I allow her to be, yet she is, in my opinion, not equal to MiSs “ Lessey.—When I returned from GlaS-“ gow to my father’s, the pleaSure of fee-ing my family was considerably increaSed by the Sweet Society of that amiable “ girl, who was under the care of Mr. “ and Mrs. Edwards, near neighbours “ to my father; both of them very agree-" able and worthy people: but to de-“ Scribe the beauties and the graces of “ the inchanting Fanny, is beyond my “ powers;—and had I powers adequate “ to the tash, I would not trust you, “ RuSsly, with Such a portrait,—though “ I am certain that your heart is irre-coverably lost to MiSs Cecilia Brere-ton.—But why,” continued he with a

look of deSpair, should I refrain from “ the description of charms which can^ “never be mine?—Imagine, then. Sir “ Edward, that you See an elegantly pro-portioned figure about the middle size, “ with a neck and arms as white as the “ driven Snow, and with the Same com-“ plexion, animated by a vivid glow of “ health.—^tler eyes are the most Soft-“ ly-expressive to be conceived; and “ when modestly cast down, almost “ hid by long, thick, shining eye-lashes; ‘‘ her fine glossy hair of the Same bright “ colour, she wears careleSsly turned back under a laced round cap, which gives an additional air of innocence to “ her face, though the Simplicity of her “ manners would be Sufficient to kindle “ the flame ^f love without any other animating charm— : her mouth and teeth are inexpressibly bewitching, but “ her disposition is still more captivating “ than her perSon; So tender.

“ Ah, George, George,” cried Sir Edward, “ you endeavour to make me “ believe you are not beloved, but you “ endeavour in vain.

She “ has, therefore, been accustomed rather “ to a retired life, which she Seems to ap-“ prove of; yet she hasconverfed enough “ with polite people to acquire a man-“ ner which is neither to be defined nor “described.”
The entrance of MiSs Brereton put a stop to any further conversation concerning MiSs Lessey, and Sir Edward left his friend more Satisfied than he had yet been, having been assured by him that he had nothing to apprehend from him in the shape of a rival,
Cecilia now began to perceive that Mr. MonSoffs approaches were too brilk to be considered as arising from the impulses of brotherly affedion, and tha-his indifference to, not to fay total net gledt of, Maria, was very visible to all
C z	the
i-aS The Historv of
the family, particularly So to that lady herSelf; who, from a good-nature not to be often met with in a fine girl, on Seeing her Sister treated with Superior com-plaiSance, very Serioufiy intreated her father, who beheld her with partial eyes, to make Mr. MonSon happy with Ceci-■ lia: though it is highly probable, that if she had not been Secretly in love with Wallace, site would have been leSs Solicitous about the marriage of her sister with the man who had So grofiy affronted her pride.
Mr. Brereton expressed the utmost Surprize at this intelligence and request; but immediately told his daughter, that a man who could So Soon remove his addresses from one to the other, was, in his opinion, not a proper hushand for either; and that if she was Sure of not being mistaken, he would take an opportunity to desire MonSon to quit his houSe, not Supposing that Cecilia would be So weak as to like a man who had discovered So mucff fickleneSs. But the removal of Monlbn was not the event which Maria wanted to bring about : she Saw very plainly that her Sister was in love with
Wallace;
,Mr. Vf AL LACE. 29
Wallace; and as she earnestly wished to shave herdiSpoSed of, and imagined, from her behaviour, that Monlbn was the next most agreeable man to her, she was in hopes that her Scheme would prove Successful, if her father could be induced to comply with it: but, finding that he would not listen to her propoSals, she turned her eyes towards Sir Edward RuSsly, who was alSo, she obServed, very public in his assiduities to Cecilia, while she, at the Same time, took every method in her power to diScover how extremely agreeable Mr. Wallace was to herSelf. As he was, however, in no way particular in his behaviour to her, she found it Somewhat difficult to make him Sensible of what he had no desire to become acquainted with. Every little artifice did she, with all the dexterity she , was mistreSs of, put in practice to pleaSe, to
■	charm him, to rouzehis tenderneSs, and to
■	inSpire his Soul with love to nopurpoSe; for the idea of his amiable Fanny still reigned triumphant in his mind, and rendered him, if not totally indifferent to Maria, So cool in his carriage as to blast all her fond expedations.
' c 3	His

His frigid behaviour at first piqued her pride, and almost prompted her ter Seek for an opportunity to revenge the negle<st which her perSonal attraftions, and the advances which she had made to him, she thought, deServed; but his manners were, in every other reSpedt, So very engaging, that she found herSelf incapable of injuring what she could not possibly help loving. She often, indeed, shewed reSentment; but as he either did not, or would not, take notice of it, no Satisfa(5tion aroSe from her efforts of that kind.
While Maria was thus hourly endeavouring to charm Wallace, Sir Edward RuSsly was employing the most tender, the most Submishve eloquence to prevail on Cecilia to listen to him: but he employed all his eloquence ineffeftually. So amiable, however, was his behaviour, and So dejeded his air, whenever she refufed to hear him upon the only Subject on which he wished to Speak, or when she rejeded any of his little offers to pleaSe her, that her gentle bofom Selt pitying SenSations for him; and she was the more inclined to compassionate his

She strove, indeed, with the utmost diligence to conceal her feelings : imagine, then, her confusion and Surprize, when Sir Edward Said to her one day, after having vented a number of fruitleSs' complaints against her cold-neSs and indifference, “ Had I but been “ fortunately acquainted with you, Ma-“ dam, before you had Sden my friend “ Mr. Wallace, I possibly might have ■ ^ been able, by my reSpe<5t, tenderneSs, “ and assiduity, to touch a heart of “ which he has been, I See too plainly, for ‘‘ Some time poffeffed.’*
Poor Cecilia, ready to die with confusion, and blushing almost to tears, replied, “ Gracious Heaven! What can “ you mean. Sir Edward?” After a moment’s pauSe, “ Spare me, I intreat you,” continued she, with a Softened voice; “ nor imagine that, though I cannot “ look upon you in the light you would “ have me, I am capable of thinking of “ a man, however amiable, who has no “ attachment to^me.’*

The last words, in Spite of all her caution,, were Spoke with So weak a voice, that they were hardly intelligible: she turned away her head to hide her moistened eyes; but Sir Edward Saw the tears roll dov/n her face. Struck with the greatest concern at the pain which he had undeSignedly given ■her, he begged her, in the most Submissive terms, to pardon him, for having mentioned what his unSucceSsful passion for her would not permit him to remain ignorant of, assuring her, at the fame time, that he loved her too well not to be ready, nay, even desirous, to resign all hopes of his own happineSs to infure hers.—“ Most probably,” continued he, “ when this happy fellow knows how “ high he is in the esteem of the charm-“ ing MiSs Cecilia, he may at once “ quit all thoughts of her whom, were “ he to wait for, he may possibly never “ be able to gain.”
TheSe few concludingwords gave Such an alarm to Cecilia, that it threw her quite off her guard; with a faint voice, and with a face and neck glowing like fcarlet, she Said, turning from Sir Edward,
Mr. W A L L A C E:	33
ward, “ Mr. Wallace’s heart, then, is y engaged. Sir.?”
Sir Edward, who loved her, and who aftually felt all her distreSs, pitied her confusion; but though it certainly was likely that her being acquainted with the situation of Mr. Wallace’s heart, would not prove disadvantageous to him, he thought alSo that the early knowledge of the worst might contribute to her advantage by curing her of an ill placed passion, and give Some relief to her over-charged mind. It had that effedl; for it drew from her an instantaneous shower of tears, which she hastily wiped away; then lifting up her Sweet bashful eyes for a moment, she Said,“ I know not “ how to look on you. Sir Edward : ‘‘ you See before you a Simple girl op-“ pressed with shame at having thus diS-“ covered the Secrets of her breast: fe-• ‘ crets, which though not criminal, are “ So repugnant to the delicacy of my Sex:,' “ that I could wish to hide them for “ ever, even from myfelf. I should have “ had more fortitude, more pride, than “ to have betrayed an inclination for a ‘‘man who has none for me; but I will

“ May I hope then,” Said he, with the most tender and Submissive voice, “ to “ have a share in that So much wished-“ for alteration in your Sentiments ? and “ may I flatter mySelf that I shall, one day. Supply the place of my happy y friend ?”
A sigh was all the reply which she made to him; but after a little hesitation, “ Why do you call him happy, “ Sir Edward?” Said she; “ if I remember “ right, you told me that he might, poS-sibly, never gain the objedt of his af-fedlions: what pains are more infup-“ portable than thoSe which are occafi-oned by unreturned love ?”
“ I meant. Madam, that he was happy in being lb favourably looked upon by you.”
“ Not at all, replied Cecilia, mypar-“ tiality for him gives him no pleaSure, it is probably rather difgusting; and
he
Mr. WALLACE. 55
he, perhaps, pines and sighs for one who as little heeds him.”
Company appearing not far from them in the garden, prevented Sir Edward from continuing a conversation which was, he thought, very interesting, but which made too deep an impression upon Cecilia for her peace. Finding that Sir Edward was become master of a Secret which she never had intended to diScloSe, she treated him with more consideration from that time, though not the least Spark of a prepossession in his favour appeared to be mixed with it.
Mr. Brereton, agreeably to what he had Said to Maria, took an opportunity to tell Mr. MonSon, that, as he had found he had changed his mind with regard to his daughter, it was highly improper for him to be any longer a visitor in his family and therefore hoped that he would Spare him the diSagreeable office of desiring him to quit it.

gave him no fort of encouragemenstreturn-ed to his first mistreSs, and affedted a strange Surprize at the carriage of Mr. Brereton; affuring him that he had riot transferred his astedlions from MiSs Brereton to any other woman. On being charged with giving the preference to Cecilia, he declared, that he had only been a little particular to her, in order to try the strength of her sister’s inclinations for him, whom he still loved with as much ardor and sincerity as ever; and intreated Mr. Brereton to let him have the happineSs of Speedily calling him father. That gentleman, however, would on no accounts make a promiSe till he had again con-stilted his favourite, Maria; he only permitted MonSon to continue his addreffes; to her.

A party upon the water having been formed one hot evening, theSe six young pepple, with Mr. Brereton, Spent Some agreeable hours in a large pleaSure-boat with muSick ; during which Mr. MonSon, endeavoured to render himSelf acceptable to MiSs Brereton, who diredled all her looks towards Wallace. Sir Edward RuSsly was very assiduous near MiSs Ce-;	^	...	cilia^

cilia, and MiSs Myers strove with all her powers of plea,Smg, to extort a Smile of .complacency from Sir Edward. If Wallace had been left to his own choice in this little party, Cecilia would have been the fair one to whom he would have attached himSelf for the evening, becauSe, in her perSon and disposition, she came the nearest to his amiable Fanny: but the fear of giving the least uneaSineSs to his friend, kept him from Seeking any opportunity to entertain her. An accident, however. Soon happened, which obliged him to appear the principal figure in the groupe, and fixed him too deeply in Cecilia’s memory to be easily eraSed.,
Sir Edward had remained cloSe by her Side till Mr Brereton drew him from it, by ashing a question which made it necessary for him to leave his Seat. While he was giving Mr. Brereton the desired information, Cecilia leaning too far over the boat to look at Something, fell into the water. Wallace, who happened to be nearest to her, plunged in immediately after her, and brought her out before she had quite loft her fenSejs. Fear ; .. - ^
The History of
had almost deprived her of them; but when she Saw who her deliverer was, and to what danger he had voluntarily, ex-pofed himSelf for her preservation, ter^ ror yielded to gratitude, and a still Soft* er passion So far over-powered her, that she could hardlyhide her tender feelings, while she, half recovered, hung languishing upon his arm.
Sir Edward, who was exceedingly alarmed at the condition she was in, flew to her, and but too plainly perceived, that the assistance which his friend had afforded her, gave her a pleafurp equal to the shock which she had received.
This difaster obliged them all to return home with all poshble expedition. Both the Sisters expressed fb much concern, lest Wallace’s health should be injured by his fitting in his wet cloaths, that they evidently discovered how much they were interested in every thing relating to him. Mr. Brereton alfo expressed the most lively gratitude for the Safety of his daughter, calling him the preServer of his child : he made him go into a warm bed immediately upon their landing,

Mr. WALLACE; ^9
and took as much care of him, as if he had been his own Son,
Wallace, who had, indeed, done no more for Cecilia than he would have done for any other woman upon the Same occasion, and who was only a6tuated by humanity, appeared to be the most eaSy and compoSed of any perSon in the family; every other individual in it was apprehensive lest Something might ariSe from the eve»t. MiSs Brereton was, however, far the most So, as she had at first discovered her sister’s prepossession for Wallace, which was, she very clearly perceived, increaSed by it; and knowing, at the Same time, her father’s high opinion of him, she concluded that nothing was more probable than a marriage between them: she, therefore, redoubled her affiduity about him, and ever* ventured to shew Some tenderneSs and much anxiety, lest his continuance long in his wet cloaths, as they could not immediately get home, should endanger his health. Her attentions about him were indeed So remarkable, that, as he found himfelf not difpofed to make an adequate return, they grew rather embar-

raffing, and he reSolved to put a Speedy concluSion to his visit at Mr. Brereton’s, and to take possession of his chambers in the Temple. He, was: the more desirous of taking this step on poor Cecilia’s account, who, with the most diligent caution, studied to conceal her love; but it was So interwoven with gratitude, that all her efforts were insufficient to restrain it in Such a manner as to prevent the appearance of it. Some signs, in Spite of her utmost vigilance, were obServa-ble by every body about her; they were indeed too Striking to be overlooked by the most careleSs obServer.
Mr. Brereton was not lefs willing than his daughters that Wallace should leave them; but his reaSons were So just, and So laudable in a young man who was by nature formed for a life of pleaSure, and So frequently urged, that Mr. Brereton v/ould have injured him, on even offering any kind of opposition to his purSuit: on the contrary, he greatly commended the propriety of his con-du6l, insisting only upon his coming down to him as often as his leiSure would permit him.

Sir Edward RuSsly could not well let flip this opportunity to offer to accompany his friend. He was much pieaSed v/ith Mr. Brereton’s pressing him to stay with him still longer; but Mr. MonSon was obliged, quite against his inclination, to decamp: for Mr. Brereton told him in plain terms, at the intreaty of Maria, that after the negledl which he had discovered, she never would be his, and that he would never give Cecilia to a man who had been designed for her sister.
When both thoSe gentlemen had left them. Sir Edward applied himSeif with more Solicitude than ever, to gain the heart of Cecilia, but made no progrefs: yet though she discovered no love, she felt compassion for his tender complaints against her indifference; and often Said, “ Why, Sir Edward, will you persist to “ follow me; me, who am not able to “ do justice to the merit which you are, “ 1 cannot but own, poffeffed of?”
“ Had you never Seen my friend, “ MiSs Cecilia,” replied he, “ I might
have had better fortune. I might

“ Do not reproach me. Sir Edward,** cried she, mildly, “ I have the highest “ esteem for you; but I cannot avow Sentiments which I do not feel: leave “ me, therefore, and go in Search of “ another more capable of giving you the Satisfadtion which you vainly re-y quire from me.**

In this fort of conversation, they commonly Spent their time when they were together ; for Sir Edward could not prevail on himSelf to quit a woman who, notwithstanding the acknowledged preference which she gave to his friend, was still So amiable in his eyes.
Wallace, as Soon as he was Settled in the Temple, applied most indefatigably to his studies; but in compliance with his friend’s request, came down to him on a Saturday evening, and returned to London on the Monday and TueSday following at farthest. He was always received with great pleaSure by the old gentleman, with a kind of transported familiarity by Maria, and a fort of timid regard by Cecilia.
Mifs Brereton, in order to accustom him to enter into chat with her, and to furnish him with topics for conversation,, frequently gave him, when they were alone, little commishons to execute for her when he left them. Sometimes she insisted upon his writing a line to her by the post in the middle of the week, pretending that she.could not stay till he came

His letters, however, though written with the greatest politeneSs, were perfeflly free from the least, tinfture of gallantry: the letters between two ladies could not have been more innocent; for he only informed her of the punftuality with which he had obeyed her commands. The letters which passed between MiSs Brereton and MiSs Myers, who was, by this time, returned to her uncle, were penned in an infinitely warm.er Style.
While he was thus employed in obliging the daughter of his friend, he received a letter from. his eldest sister, which gave him a diSquietude he Scarce knew how to conceal.

Many times did Wallace read over this letter.

dulgence of his Softening griefs, when he should have thought of Some expedient to relieve the necessities of his family, he endeavoured to drive his mistreSs, charming as she was, from his memory; but he endeavoured in vain to drive away the train of domeS-tic resiedtions which destroyed his peace.
MiSs Brereton, who watched every motion of his eyes, Soon perceived the great dejedlion which was painted in them; and, indeed, his total diScom-pofure was visible to every body who Saw him. Mr. Brereton and Sir Edward alternately Seized opportunities to be with him by themSelves, and each pressed him earnestly to open his heart to them; but they pressed him to no purpoSe: he was equally deaf to his generous friend Rufsly, who, Sufpedt-ing that a juvenile attachment might possibly have proved too expensive for his prefent allowance, emptied his purSe before him; and to the prudent Mr. Brereton, who, with all the curiosity of a well-intentioned old man, was
not
Mr. WALLACE. 51
not leSs desirous to afford him relief. Neither the one nor the other had any hopes of fucceSs, as he attributed the dejedtion which they had obServed, to the illneSs of his younger Sister, who had been, for Some time, in a declining way.
Mere chance, however, at last, gave Mr. Brereton the desired information, which he would not have had, probably, by his own endeavour to procure it.
MiSs Brereton, it has been already Said, kept clofe to Wallace upon all occasions: she, one day, picked up the very letter which had occasioned all his diSquiet, accidentally dropped by him; and could not So far curb her curiosity as to shun the perufal of it. To do her justice, indeed, she did not know, when site opened it, to whom it was addreff-ed, as it had been originally encloSed in a cover; which cover he had destroyed : but the part on which she first threw her eyes was So extremely interesting to her, that she peruSed the

^ and though she was not of a Soft disposition, like her Sister Cecilia, she could not read it without being melted into tears.
In this Situation her father Surprized her. Having given the letter into his hand, she Sobbed out, “ Dear, dear Sir,

Mr. Brereton, touched with his daughter’s Sorrow, ran over the letter without replying; and then Said, “ This “ is a noble-minded girl, Maria, the “ exadl copy of her valuable brother :
“ let us Send for her up to town. She “ shall be alSo my daughter. Do you “ and Cecilia look upon her and trust “ her as your dearest sister.”
MiSs Brereton was immediately struck with the word sister; and having been always apprehensive that her father would give Cecilia to Wallace, whenever he discovered her attachment to

him, cried hastily, “ What do yom'-“ mean'by sister, Sir.? You Surely have “ no thoughts of marrying Cecilia to “ Mr. Wallace?”
“Why not?” SaidMr.Brereton: “ Can “ I give her to a worthier young fellow ? “ the Son of my old friend?

The different changes in Maria’s countenance, during her father’s last Speech, not a little alarmed him: could he have Seen what passed in her mind, he would have been still more astonished. E qually unable to bear the thoughts of feeing Wallace married to Cecilia, who was, she knew, ready to accept of him, and to declare the inclination which she herSelf felt for him ; at last, when she had feveral times opened her

54 The HisTORy of
lips in order to Speak, and as often doff ed them, she turned from a death-like pale to a roSy red, and bursting into a stood of tears. Said, “ Why, oh! “ why. Sir, will you not let me have “ the happineSs of calling MiSs Waff “ lace my Sister in my own right, if “ you really entertain lb high an opi-“ nion of this worthy young fellow “ Why may not your Maria be destined “ to make him and herSelf happy? “ Why may you not give my sister to “ Sir Edward RuSsly?”
After having pronounced theSe words with great difficulty, she stopped; and covering her face with her hand, waited in silent confusion for her father’s reply; who, no leSs astonished than pleaS-ed with what he had heard, claSped her fondly in his arms, and Said, “ Dost “ thou, then, love him, my dearest “ girl? And are you as Sensible of his “ merit as I am ? Look up, Maria; “ be no longer ashamed of owning a “ virtuous inclination for a deServing “ man.

“ No, indeed. Sir,” replied the artful Maria ; “ you may be assured that “ I would not take any Such step with-“ out your entire approbation.”
“ You are my best girl,” Said the old gentleman, charmed with her apparent, prudence, and her dutiful expressions; “ and if the most deServing and hand-“ Somest young fellow in England can “ make you happy, you shall be So.”
MiSs Brereton thanked her father in the most grateful and reSpedlful terms for his indulgence to her ; but as she w’-as not quite Sure of Wallace, she told him, “ that, as Mr. Wallace had, poS-fibly, no reaSon to exped; Such an of-“ fer, he might not be prepared to ac-‘‘ cept of it; and that as she had al-“ ready been mortified by the negle<5t of Mr. MonSon, she would be very D 4	“ loth

Maria, before she left her father, discovered Some apprehensions lest Wallace should be hurt by their having found out the Secrets of his family, without his knowledge or conSent; butMr.Brereton took upon him to anSvrer for all theSe things; and after having been told, by his daughter, how violently Sir Edward was in love with Cecilia, fat down diredtly to his bureau and wrote a letter to Dodtor Wallace, -wherein he informed him of the great regard he had for his Son, that he defigned him for his eldest daughter, and intreated him to Send up MiSs Wallace, whom he would, for the future, look upon as one of his own children.

The worthy physician and his wife were absolutely astonished at the receipt of this letter; and in the fullneSs of their hearts gave all due praiSes to the Almighty, who had So providentially interpoSed in their affairs, when they themSelves found it very difficult to form any advantageous Schemes; arid, having acquainted their daughter with the friendship of Mr. Brereton, bade her to prepare for her immediate depar- , ture.
MiSs Wallace, who dreaded nothing So much as a life of dependance, discovered, at first, no Satisfaiflion at the news, which had overwhelmed her father and mother with joy: but as she had ever made it the buSineSs of her life to obey them, she was now reSolved, whatever conSequences might ariSe from ' her obedience, not to recede from her duty; comforting herSelf, at the Same time, with thinking, that if any thing should happen difagreeabie to her in the family of Mr. Brereton, she could, by being So much nearer London, Sooner purSue the Scheme which she had

communicated to her brother, for the regulation of her future life : but she was quite astonished at not having received an anSwer from him.
While she was preparing to leave her native village, Wallace, who had only deferred writing to her becauSe he was uncertain what advice to give her, began to think that his Silence would be construed into unkindneSs; but upon feeling for his letter, it was no where to be found. It had indeed been dropped on the morning of his departure from Mr. Brereton’s, and he had rode to London without missing it. While he was undetermined whether he should ride back in Search of it, a letter from that gentleman was delivered to him, containing a desire to fee him immediately. He was ready to comply with the pressing invitation, hoping that he should find the letter which he miffed, in the pocket of a Suit of cloaths he had left there. Guefs then his furprize when Mr. Brereton met him with it in his hand. He. received his young friend with the mosh

cordial affedlion, and after a Snort apology for having read the letter, told him, “ that he had Sent for his Sister to “ make a visit to his daughter; that “ he admired her Spirit ; and that he “ would exert his friendship in looking “ out for a reward adequate to her “ great merit. We will be all one fa-“ mily,” added he.
Wallace, extremely astonished, bowed reSpedfully, and expressed his gratitude in the best terms he could think of, from the SuddenneSs of the affair ; and when he had quitted Mr. Brere-ton, was met by Maria, who affured him, “ that her father had given her “ the greatest pleaSure by inviting “ MiSs Wallace to town ; and that she “ impatiently wished for her com-“ pany.”
Mr. Wallace returned her compliments vrith a reSpedlful politeneSs ; but wondered that he had heard nothing of all this from MiSs Cecilia, nor from Sir Edward : the former, indeed, had not

Maria now redoubled every endeavour, every care, to pleaSe her destined / hiishand, while he was lost in wonder at ail that passed. In the midst of that wonder, he received a letter from his father and mother, “ wherein they ‘‘ expreffed the highest joy at Mr.
‘‘ Brereton’s intentions in his favour,
“ with his additional kindneSs to his “ sister, who was on her way to town;
“ and informed him where he might “ meet her at her last stage.” They concluded with Saying, “ that they “ did not believe he wanted any ex-“ citement to treat his future, MiSs ^ “ Brereton, with the most reSpedlful “ tenderneSs; and that they should add “ nothing on that Subjed;, but their “ Sincere prayers for his increasing fe-licity.”
^ Wallace was now more astonished than ever; he was all amazement; but too Soon found that he was really designed foi Maria. The letter dropped
from
Mr. WALLACE. 6i
' from his trembling hand, at the confirmation of his apprehensions; and having breathed out, with a half Suppressed sigh, “ Oh ! Fanny,” he Sunk motionleSs into a chair.
In this situation he was accosted by Sir Edward, who not finding him any where below stairs, came to look for him in his own apartment.
Wallace roSe at his entrance, picked tip the letter, and ashed him, “ how “ long he had been acquainted with “ this design of their old friend’s, to “ marry him to Maria.”
I heard of it but yesterday, from “ Cecilia,” replied Sir Edward, ‘‘ who “ had just then been informed of it
herSelf.”
Cecilia had, indeed, been first acquainted with it by her sister; and with the utmost difficulty was able to conceal the emotions which it occasioned ; emotions which she could only conceal by retiring hastily to the garden ;
where,

. where, deeming herSelf unSeen, she gave a free vent to her sighs and her tears, and could not help thinking, that as her father had not looked upon W^allace as unworthy of being his Son, she might herSelf as well have given him that title as her Sister, who, if Mr. MonSon had not changed the objedt of his asiedlions, would have been diS-poSed of before, and have left her a-lone for the man of her choice.
Sir Edward, who clofely followed her steps, caught her thus giving way to her vexation ; and as she was in a state of the utmost confusion, extorted the Secret from her, the diScloSure of which made her See no bounds to her complaints ; and thoSe complaints So Sensibly affedled him, that he told her, after having in vain attempted to Soothe / her Sorrows, he was Sure Wallace preferred not Maria to her. ‘‘ Doatingly “ as I love you, my dear Cecilia,” continued he, ‘‘ I will freely conSent
to resign you, if by that resignation ‘‘ your felicity will be inSured. I will y go diredtly to my friend, and tell him
“ how
Mr. WALLACE. 63
“ how much he is esteemed by you, as I firmly believe that Mr. Brere-ton, if he can but make him his Son-“ in-law, will not care to which of ‘‘ his daughters he is married.”
Cecilia, shocked, beyond expreshon, at the indelicacy of Such a proceeding, ran after him, stopped him, intreated him to come back, and desired him “ to feal up his lips on that Subject, “ unleSs he had a mind to See her ex-“ pire with shame before him.”
Sir Edward, who was only impelled by a noble eagernefs to facrisice his own happinefs for the promotion of hers, though he certainly wished to have effected it in a way more pleasing to himSelf, desisted from his design, at her earnest request, and Solemnly Swore not to divulge the Secret which he had discovered, either to his friend, or to any other perfon.
In this manner did the amiable Cecilia preferve her delicacy, at the ex-pence of her love ; and Sir Edward

si4	The HiSTORy of
endeavoured to be Satisfied, though she would not promiSe to be his, in not feeing her become the wife of another. But this unexpedled event, and the agonies which she had Suffered by the concealment of her SenSations, shocked her Spirits So much, that she fell into a state of dejecStion, which was too visible to every body who beheld her, and which Sir Edward, ever attentive, ever assiduous, about her, tried with the most unwearied diligence to remove,
In a few days after theSe tranfadtions, the time arrived for the departure of Wallace to meet his sister, in Mr. Brereton’s post chaiSe. The interview between the brother and the Sister was very affedlionate. When she told him of her dread, with regard to the tyrannical authority which women of Superior fortune are apt to exerciSe over thoSe whom they countenance by their patronage, “ he begged her to make “ herSelf eaSy, and affured her, that “ he would be always watchful over ^ her, and take care to Secure a re-
treat
Mr. WALLACE. 65
treat if she was treated according to her apprehensions.” He then as freely opened his heart to her, and declared, “ that he hardly thought it ho-“ nest to marry a woman for whom “ he felt no inclination, merely with “ a view to Serve his family by her ' “ fortune.”
“ Why, that is not your view,” replied she; ‘‘ Mr. Brereton propoSed “ this alliance to my father, in order “ to make his daughter happy by “ uniting her to a man, who is, by his virtue, capable of rendering her So. “ As you have not Sought her, you are “ entirely free from the imputation of any dishonourable designs ; and as “ she is a fine young woman, and “ loves you, in my opinion you stand “ a fair chance to make both yourSelf “ and her happy,”
Wallace replied only with a sigh, which he strove to stifle in its passage; and his Sister Spent the rest of the time, whilst they were together, in trying to reconcile him to what she plainly
law
The FIistorv of
Saw was the joint desire of their parents. ‘‘ I want not,” Said she, “ my ‘‘ dear brother, to perSuade you to act “ contrary to your inclination in So “ very important a point; but let me “ adviSe you to weigh it well, and tho-“ roughly consider every circumstance ‘‘ concerning this affair before you de-termine how to adt.”
He promised to follow her advice, and rumdnated in this manner upon the Singularity of his condition : “ DiS-“ agreeably situated as my family are at “ this time, can I hope to give them “ afsistance during the courSe of many “ years, it I refuie this advantageous “ offer; the refufal of which"^ will “ doubtleSs be attended with tlie irre-“ trievable loSs of Mr. Brereton’s “ friendship? I have, it is true, hitherto “ felt no fort of passion for Maria ; yet “ file is certainly formed by nature to “ infpire love in a bofom fensible of her “ beauty : she is certainly partial to “ me, and if I refuSe her, shall I not “ ruin mySelf and my family, without the Smallest hopes of gratifying my
“ in-
Mr. WALLACE. 67
- inclination for the amiable Fanny, “ Supposing fortune and her heart alike “ favourable to me ? Is she not far re-moved from me ? Am I not igno-. “ rant of the place to which she is “ gone ? And, were I to find her out, “ may she not be destined by her pa-‘‘ rents, to whom alSo I am a stranger, “ to the arms of another ? May she not “ be aclually the wife of a man, “ who may be possessed of a heart, “ which, were I master of every “ wished advantage, I may possibly be never able to obtain ? And is it not infinitely better to marry a woman “ by whom I am certainly beloved, than one whom I only love my-“ Self?”
All theSe queries and replies were revolved a thouSand times in his mind, while his Sister Sat Silently waiting by his side, for his determination. He at length told her, “ that he would coni-“ ply with the wishes of all his friends, “ and endeavour to make the lady not “ repent of her choice.” Gratitude alSo for the great civilities just intended
6S	The Historv of
ed for his dear Eleonora, had no Small share in this resolution; and he affured her that she should ever find him a friendly brother.”
During the above conversation, Wallace mentioned not a single word which dilcovered the^ most distant regard for MiSs Lessey ; nor did Eleonora imagine that he distinguished her from any other young lady.
When he brought his sister to Mr. Brereton’s, the two young ladies, as well as their father, flew to receive her with the greatest affedlion. Maria and Cecilia were both struck with her first appearance ; but they were both struck in a different manner. As MiSs Wallace as nearly reSembled her brother as a woman can reSemble a man, Maria clalped her to her bofom with a tenderneSs which she would have shewn to Wallace himSelf, if female modesty had not checked her: but Cecilia, startled at the extreme likeneSs, and feeling at the fame time a conSciouSneSs pf the impropriety of her loving what
was
Mr. WALLACE. 6g
was nevertheless So truly amiable in her eyes, shrunk back at her touch, and trembled all over when she received her Salute, which she had no power to return ; and had she not been Supported by Sir Edward, who was cloSe behind her, she would have Sunk to the floor. A look which she directed towards him, as he led her to her Seat, discovered what passed in her heart; while she pleaded ill health, to apologize for her beha-, viour to the company.
MiSs W allace was almost oppressed with the politenesses which she received from the whole family into which she was introduced: and, notwithstanding the graces of her manner, and her natural complaisance, would have been rather at a loSs to return them if her brother had not assisted her ; who, in doing So, mingled more gallantry to Maria than he had ever yet shewn to her. This improvement in his carriage not only railed her Spirits, but elevated thole of her father; and nobody was inclined, in the little party,. to be Serious but poor Cecilia. Sir Edward, indeed,-was
alSo,
70 The HisTORy of
alSo, from the agitation of his mind, leSs chearful than the rest of the company; though, as he was now certain that his Cecilia could not be Mrs. Wallace, he had Sometimes hopes that time might stand his friend, and make a change in his favour.
The evening passed away in general converfation; but the next morning, ' when Mr, Brereton, accompanied by Maria and Wallace, had conduded Mifs Wallace into the garden, and pointed out to her the beauties of his retreat, he stopped at a little temple near the houSe; and there, while the friendly old man fat between the brother and the Sister, he faid to Eleonora, after he had received a very pretty compliment from her, on the elegance of the rural Spots around them ; "‘lam glad you “ are pleafed with my retreat; it may, “ one day, be your brother’s, if he is in “ the fame mind. I look upon you, the “ daughter of my good old friend, as “ my own daughter, and upon Wallace “ as my Son: What Say you, young man

/
Mr. WALLACE. 71
‘‘ What Say you, Maria ? Are you wil-“ ling, George, to become my Son.^”
“ I must assc this lady’s permission “ first,” replied Wallace, with an un-uSual colour in his cheeks which heightened his manly beauties, and with a modesty of aSpedl and of voice which rendered him absolutely irresistible; then turning to Maria, and taking her hand, “ May I hope. Madam,” Said he, “ that your father’s uncommon ge-“ nerous propoSal meets with your ap-“ probationIf you honour me with an “ affirmative anSwer, you will lay me “ under obligations which I shall never, “ I fear, be able to repay; but I will “ make it the study of my life, to de-“ Serve your partiality in my favour.’*
MiSs Brereton threw down her eyes to hide the Sparkling Satisfadlion which shone in them, and with a voice which perfeftly indicated the abSolute content she enjoyed, replied, that she had no will but her father’s.
y Mine,
72	The HiSTORy of
“ Mine, then,’’ Said Mr. Brereton, “ is, that you both do every thing in “ your power to make each other hap-“ py for the remainder of your days. “ The ceremony shall be peifformed as “ Soon as the necessary writings can be “ drawn; I will give my girl twenty “■ thouSand pounds down, and five “ thouSand more on the birth of the “ first child; and you, turning to Wal-“ lace, shall make a proper Settlement: “ with this, and with the buSineSs I “ can bring you into, I fancy you may “ do pretty well.”
Wallace, with the most reSpedtful humility, ‘‘ declared that theSe favours “ were greatly beyond his expedlations; “ that he was entirely at a loSs how to “ expreSs his gratitude for them, but “ that he would endeavour to deServe “ them.” He then kissed Maria’s hand; and upon the coming up of Sir Edward RuSsly, Mr. Bfereton informed him of his friend’s intended marriage; and Sir Edward ventured to embrace that opportunity to ash Mr. Brereton’s conSent to gain the affedions
of
Mr. W A L L A C E. 7^
of his Cecilia; affuring him, “that if he could but be one day So hap-“ py, he would desire no fortune, but resign it all for the advantage of his “ friend and MiSs Brereton.”
The old gentleman praiSed his generosity, and told him, “ that he requir-“ ed no Such proofs of his love, but “ that he hoped his youngest daughter “ would not be inlenSible to the com-“ pliment which he paid her.”
Sir Kdward, tranfported to have met with_ So much SucceSs with the father of his Cecilia, went in Search of her; and having found her on one of the benches in the garden, in a melancholy attitude, he fat down by her, and taking her hand. Said, alternately trembling with hope and fear, “ Can you, “ MiSs Cecilia, pardon me for what “ I have just been doing? I shall, I “ trust, merit your forgiveneSs, when “ I tell you, that while there was the least probability of your being given “ to the man of your heart, I restrain-“ ed from making any application to VoL.

and amnSement; to preServe her from “ every vexation, every care; and to “ give up my whole time in order to V make her life uninterruptedly happy.”
Cecilia started, at first, at hearing that he had Spoken to her father; but the mention of a feparation from him foon awakened every tender thought; and shereplied, in mournful accents, “What “ happinefs can you propoSe to enjoy, “ Sir Edward, in being possessed of a “ woman, who, cold and inSenSible to “ all yourendeavourstopleaSeher, who “ Sighs!—Oh my shame!” continued she, covering her face with her handkerchief:

‘‘ But, indeed, Rufsly, lean nevermake “ you happy: you have my best wishes;
but alas! you have not my heart.** She wept as she Spoke theSe last words through mere compassion to her lover, who had need of all his fortitude to check his Sympathizing Sorrow.
When she had a little recovered her-felf, he, with the most perSuaSive eloquence of love, intreated her only to conSent to become his wife; declared that she should be her own mistreSs in every reSpeft, as much as she was at that moment; and affured her that he would wait patiently till time had wrought a change in his favour.
A deep sigh was her reply, which, though not entirely fatisfaftory, was not ‘ entirely diScouraging; for as she had not in positive terms granted his request, neither had she in thoSe terms denied it.

of a third perSon, employed every private moment in Soothing her tender ‘griefs and diverting her melancholy re-fiedlions; and he employed them So Successfully, that she, in a little while, not only fought his company, but cared for no other. Yet was not any love mixed with the friendship which she frankly avowed for him.
Wallace, in the mean time, paid his court to Maria with lb much addreSs, that every thing was in the greatest forwardness between them: yet he never negledted his buSineSs to wait on the lady, for which diligence her father warmly commended him.
As MiSs Wallace was quite a stranger to London, MiSs Brereton made it her bufineSs to introduce her to every place of public diversion; to which, as they were but a few miles from town, they could easily be conveyed: Cecilia, however, could never be prevailed on to make one in their parties. She chole rather to sit at home with RuSsly by her si.de, and to give way to foftdejedion,
in
Mr. WA L L A C E. 77
in which he freely indulged her, hoping that by encouraging her Sensibility, he might himSelf, one day, become the Subjedl: of it.
One evening, at the Opera, MiSs Brereton and Mr. Wallace were accosted with great politeneSs by Mr. Mon-Son; who, though he addressed them both with his voice, fixed his eyes So earnestly on Mils Wallace, that he threw her into confusion : he perceived it, and immediately relieved it, by turning them to another part of the houSe; but the beauty of her perSon, and the amiable expreffion which appeared in her countenance, gave him a pleaSure \vhich he wished to renew. He, therefore, made himSelf of their party for the rest of the evening, much against the inclination of MiSs Brereton.
There was So striking a reSemblance between MiSs Wallace and her brother, that MonSon would immediately have known her, if the appellation of Sister had not been frequently Sounded in his ears: but it gave him Some con-
E 3	cern
y8	The Historv of
cern that she was So nearly related to him : for though he had an esteem for Wallace, on account of his agreeable qualities, he knew that his fortune was very Small, and consequently imagined that his Sister’s could not be large. Besides, her residence at Mr. Brereton’s rendered it difficult for him to become acquainted with her, as he had by his behaviour to Maria excluded himfelf from any connexions with that family. However, he made the best uSe he could of the preSent moment; and found, upon engaging her in conversation, that her good SenSe was equal to her beauty: he alSo took a proper opportunity to compliment Wallace on his having So amiable a relation; and in leading her out, gave her Sufficient reaSon to believe that he had not beheld her with indifference.
Eleonora, though of a Serious and Sedate disposition, was far from being an InSensible; she could not help think-ing that Mr. MonSon was the most agreeable rnan she had ever Seen. He was really handSome and genteel, and
his
Mr. WALLACE. 79
his conversation was pleasing and entertaining; nor was he naturally of a fickle, inconstant temper, though he appeared to be So. He loved MiSs • Brereton extremely, before he went abroad; but time, during his abSence, had occasioned a great change in the two Sisters, and had robbed Maria of numberleSs graces to bestow them upon Cecilia: yet, upon finding that he could not Soften the heart of the latter to love, he would have, rather than diSoblige his father, who was he knew indifferent about the sisters, taken Maria : but, as she had fixed her heart on Wallace, she availed herSelf of Mon-Son’s incertitude to get rid of him: and he had just reconciled his father to the disappointment when he met with Eleonora, with whom he was infinitely more charmed than he had been with either of the MiSs Breretons: but howto get her was the point, and in what manner to attack her. He could not think of marrying a woman with nothing, while his father was alive.
E 4	During
So	The HisTORy of
During the agitation of his mind upon this occasion, MiSs Brereton was employed in taking notice to Wallace of his monstrous preSumption in joining them; and of letting fiis Sister know, how very impertinently, as she termed it, he had behaved in their family.
MiSs Wallace, having been So lately introduced among them, and therefore quite unacquainted with what had paS-Sed, Said nothing to the vehement charge against Mr. MonSon; but could not help Secretly wishing that he had been mentioned in a more favourable manner. Very Soon was she Sensible of the difference between the two Sisters in their dispositions; and could not but wonder. Sometimes, that her brother had given the preference to Maria: however, as she never Saw any thing in his looks or behaviour which discovered the least inclination for Cecilia, she, one day, when they were quite alone, almost inadvertently expressed her Sentiments, tho’ very distantly to him, upon that Subjed. “ I conSeSs, my dear Eleo-
nora,” Said he, “ that there is Some-
Mr. WALLA C E. 8i
thing very amiable in MiSs Cecilia; but as I looked Tipon theSe ladies, from my first acquaintance with them, far beyond my hopes, I did “ not give mySelf leave to indulge a Serious thought about them ; and as “ I found Soon afterwards, that my friend was excessively charmed with Cecilia, that diScovery would have checked ipe, if I had ventured to “ form any bretenSions to her. Be-“ sides, as Mr. Brereton himSelf fixed “ upon his' eldest daughter, I could not, you know, frame any ob-jeftioE.”
Eleonora, as she had marked Something in the disposition of Maria which 'was not agreeable to her, thought it more prudent to make no reply, and was therefore silent.
When every thing Was just ready for the performance of the marriage ceremony, Mr. Brereton was Seized with ■■an apopledtic sit^ which carried him off m a few hours.

As this unexpedled and melancholy event cauSed a general Sorrow and confusion in the family, the ceremony; it may be SuppoSed, was retarded by iti Cecilia and Wallace grieved with the ut^ most Sincerity for the loSs of the father and of the friend; Maria, though she had ever been distinguished as his favourite child, and had So lately received Such strong proofs ofHsis attention to her happineSs, felt not So much concern as they did at his deceaSe, nor was that concern of So long a duration as might have been rationally expedted. She appeared, indeed, before company, to be violently afflidled; but when she was only with her intimates, her countenance was enlivened with its uSual chearfulneSs. She even went So far as to declare her Surprize at her lover’s de-jedlion, and attempted to laugh him out of it, ashing him, how he,, who was no way. related to her father, “ and who had not known him long* could be So prodigiousiy ashidled?” As I was known to him So little a “ time, madam,” replied he gravely, I am the more obliged to him. The

confidence which he has repoSed in “ me, does me the highest honour;
“ and my heart will be ever warmed “ with gratitude for Such unmerited “ esteem.’*
“ If you are conScious that it was “ unmerited,*’ Said she, “ you pay my “ father’s memory, I think, but an ill “ compliment, by affronting his diS-“ cerriment.”
“ Not at all,” anSwered he, briSkly, shocked at her reply ; “ I pay him the “ greatest compliment in believing,
that from the uprightneSs of his own “ conscience, he SuppoSed a similarity “ in mine, and therefore invested me “ with the most capital of all trusts,

' As she took thele few concludino: words to be complimental ones, she made no anSwer to them; but her whole behaviour, after the death of Mr. Brereton, did not give Wallace the most favourable opinion of the 'wo-

Sir Edward RuSsly, alSo, had reafon to lament the death of his friend ; for as Soon as Cecilia’s grief began to Subside a little, she flattered herSelf with fresh hopes concerning Wallace. She well knew the capriciouSneSs of her sister, and imagined,, that as she had now lost the only perSon who had any right over her, she might very possibly change her mind ; and that Wallace, if refuSed by her sister, would not be averSe to her.
Animated by this Self-flattery, she redoubled her civilities to him and to Eleonora, who being very much pleaSed with her gentle disposition, strove, in her turn, to make herSelf agreeable to MiSs Cecilia.
Sir Edward, who Soon perceived this change in her, and perceived it with regret, ventured one day to mention it to her t she was extremely hurt

Mr. WALLACE. %
by the emotion which she felt at his having taken notice of it; but could not refrain from Saying, “ Ah ! how “ can I help esteeming the man who “ Saved my life at the hazard of his “ own 1”
About this time the uncle of Mils Myers, whoSe illneSs had occasioned her departure from Mr. Brereton’s, died, and she returned, at the invitation of Maria, to keep her company, as winter approachecL,
MiSs Brereton, who, like other girls of her gay, pleaSurable complexion,, had never been fond of Spending a winter in the country, now complained heavily of the tediouSneSs of the evenings, rendered more inelancholy by their recent loSs, and propofed to take lodgings in town till the return of Spring. Her propoSal was warmly Seconded by MiSs Myers, but not at all relished by Cecilia, who preferred the tranquility of their retreat to the bustle and tumult of London ; but as Maria had been, accustomed from her cradle

The death of Mr. Brereton had made it neceffary for Sir Edward RuSs-ly to quit the houfe, though he was-still a constant visitor to Cecilia, who, when Wallace was abSent longer than uSual (for he frequently came down to fee his sister) went to MiSs Brereton’s lodgings, where she had a chance to find him..
Mr. MonSon, vrho since his interview with MiSs Wallace at the Opera,, had stretched his faculties in order to contrive a method to fee her again, upon Maria’s removal to town, the only perSon whom he wished not to See, took a lodging in the Same village, and walked perpetually about the houSe in hopes of beholding the new objedt of his affection ; but he was for Some time unSuccefsful in his walks; At last, on a fine morning, as she and
Cecilia.

Cecilia were returning home from a ' short excursion in the neighbourhood, he accosted them, and endeavoured by every art he was master of, to render himSelf agreeable to MiSs Wallace, and was happy in his endeavours beyond expeftation. By his dexterity and addreSs he So insinuated himSelf into the favour of both the ladies, that fie easily found admittance into the houSe, on the footing of a former acquaintance of Mr. Brereton’s; as Cecilia wa^ too much taken up with her grief for the loSs of her father, and with her prepossession for Wallace, to pay a minute attention to proprieties. But Eleonora v/as not So inattentive to the movements of Mr. MonSon; she Saw plainly that his design was to. make himSelf agreeable to her, though she could not immediately penetrate into his views by the ashduity of his behaviour ; and he was himSelf at a loSs how to declare them to a girl whoSe appearance was ssridtly modest, and in whoSe air and manner there was a dignity which, at first sight, difcouraged all indired approaches."

Passion at length dissipated his doubts ; and he wrote a letter to her, wherein he declared the ardent love he felt for her; and lamented the avarice of his father, in terms too obvious not to be mistaken..
Eleonora was doubly hurt by fo dishonourable a letter, as she really liked the man ; but believing that she ought not to- conceal from Cecilia any part of his condud, though it would pain her to difcloSe it, she carried th? letter to

I shew it to you,” continued she, “ before I burn it, that “ I may not lie under the imputation “ of ill-breeding, by refusing to See him if he calls here with his uSual “ familiarity.”
Cecilia highly commended her prudence, and ordered the Servants never . to admit him. Her injundlions were not too Soon delivered, for he made his appearance that very afternoon ; for though he dreaded a Spirited rebuff, he was impatient to hear how his letter had been received ; and though he was apprehensive that Eleonora would be denied, he felt her denial as the most mortifying disappointment he had ever met with.
Finding it impossible for Several days to gain admittance, he dodged them in their walks, and attempted, more than once, to join them; but

For the advantage of her friend, Cecilia complied with their invitation, tho’ she did violence to her inclination by leaving the country. The way of life which MiSs Brereton and MiSs Myers,, her now inseparable companion, led, was indeed by no means Suitable either to Cecilia or Eleonora, as they had not So high a taste for the flutter of the world : both of them, could they have been happy with the men of their choice, would have lived contented in any part of the world agreeable to them; but as they had no hopes of being fettled to their SatisSadlion, they had a SeriouSneSs of afped which made

Far better, indeed, would Wallace have been pleaSed with her, if she had more re-iembled Cecilia and his sister ; but her pride and violent Spirit, v/hich could not brook the least controul, rendered her every day leSs and leSs amiable in his eyes ; So that the approach of his marriage, from which he had never ex-pedted any felicity, silled him with the most disquieting SenSations. But honour, to which he religioussy adhered, as much as the fear of making his parents unhappy, by missing what appeared to them So very advantageous a match, prompted him to ratify his engagements with MiSs Brereton, whoSe behaviour to him was unexceptionable, as her attachment to him was rather strengthened than weakened by the death of her father.
Maria more than once dropped hints as if she wished that he would give up all thoughts of buSinefs, Sinco

HISTORY
OF
Mr. WALLACE.
I
BOOK II.
\
WALLACE, (from whom the letter, mentioned towards the end^ of the last book, was concealed, lest it might be attended by a duel) tho’ MiSs Brereton and his sister were fo cold in their carriage to Mr. MonSon, behaved to him with his uSual good manners ; and Monfon, after having met with repeated rebuffs in an evening from the mistreSs of his heart, frequently whilpered to her brother.
Oh!
g6 The Historv of
“ Oh! Wallace, why is your dear sif-“ ter So lovely, and So cruel ? or ra-
ther, why is it not in my power to ‘‘ make her offers which she might, “ without a blush, accept of, could I “ but be happy enough to render my-‘‘ Seif agreeable to her ?
Wallace, who really wished to See Eleonora well married ; who Saw that MonSon was not disiiked by her, and who had, from his first acquaintance with him, been greatly pleaSed with him in his heart; wished that he had no reaSon to make thoSe queries ; but generally told him only, with a good-natured linile, that his sister w^as obliged to him.
From day to day he thus went on, and Seemed not to live but in her sight. H is steadineSs in purSuing her, his languishing looks, full of tenderncSs, always fixed upon her, though Surrounded by the finest women in the kingdom, at length drew sighs from her, when she thought that her emotions would not be perceived, and Secretly
Mr. WALLACE. 97
cretly wished, that it was proper for her to indulge the inclination which she felt to pity him.
• In this situation they continued till the sirst mourning for Mr. Brereton ■ was expired : Wallace then pressed Maria to make preparations for their marriage, to which request she readily agreed; and Sir Edward, at the fame time, strove by every Soothing art to prevail on Cecilia to follow her sister’s example. But he found his every art ineffedlual: though Eleonora, of whom she was very fond, and who knew not her Secret attachment to her brother, pleaded earnestly in his behalf, telling '' her, ‘‘ that she might never again “ meet with a man So completely • “ formed to make her happy.”
‘‘ I can live single then,” Said Cecilia.
‘‘ Yes,” replied Eleonora, but “ you are young, without a father or ‘‘ a friend proper to give you advice ;
and you may hereafter fix on a man

“ not So deServing as Sir Edward, “ Young women, my dear, are the “ most Secure when they are happily ‘‘ married.”
“ Is that your real opinion, my dear “ Eleonora ?” cried Cecilia ; “ there “ may then be Some hopes for Mon-“ Son.”
Eleonora blushed like Scarlet, and by So doing discovered what she would have concealed, if possible, even from herSelf; while Cecilia was too much taken up v/ith her own thoughts to attend much to thoSe of her friend.
Sir Edward, however, continued unweariedly to urge his intreaties. He promised So often, and with Solemnity, that she should live exadly according to her own taste, and even have a Separate apartment entirely to herSelf, if she insisted upon it; that tired out, at last, v/ith his importunities, convinced of his great merit, and the strength of his affedlion for her ; and believing that it v/ould become almost criminal in her
to
Mr. WALLACE. 99
to harbour an inclination for Wallace, when he was the hushand of her sister’ she began to make a flattering alteration in her behaviour to him.
Sitting one day by Eleonora, with Sir lEi cl ivarcl on the other side of her ; Sir Edward, on MiSs Wallace’s having mentioned Something relating to the approaching ceremony between Maria and her brother. Seized that opportunity once more to perSuade,' to intreat, to implore his lovely mistreSs to conSent to be his, when MiSs Brereton became Mrs. Wallace. She Sat Seemingly inattentive to all that he had Said, till the last words dropped from, his lips : it rouSed her. Starting from her feat hastily, without ever thinking that flie w'as on the point of betraying her Secret to Eleonora, flie cried, No, I “ will never Seay to hear her called by ‘‘ that name. There, Sir Edward, “ there is my hand : in a fortnight my “ sister is to be married, in ten days “ I will be yours ; you will promifeto “ carry me down diredly to Oxford-“ Snire, and will permit me to live in L 2	“ that
100 The HisTORy of
that retired way which I prefer to ‘‘ all the company, all the diversions “ in the world.”
The transported Sir Edward, who was astonished at this unexpedled content, and The manner in which it was worded, prepared to reply with the raptures of a man intoxicated with joy. “ Hold, Sir Edward,” Said she, ‘‘ I “ know what you would Say. I be-lieve that you love me Sincerely at ‘‘ preSent; but you can only prove “ your constancy, by complying with “ my requests when I am your wife. “ If you can bring yourSelf to comply “ with them, as you are, in my opi-on, the truest friend I have in the “ world, I will endeavour to reward “ your love ; but it must be the work “ of time.” At the conclusion of this Speech she hurried out of the room, and left him and Eleonora equally astonished at her, though in a different manner.
As Cecilia had an excellent heart, she determined from the moment she
had
- Mr. WALLACE. loi ,
had agreed to marry Sir Edward, to .do every thing in her power to render herSelf deServing of him. It was, indeed, with no Imall difficulty that flie brought herSelf to reSolve to marry him ; but when she considered that she could expedl no happineSs in living with, or near her sister, to be perpe-^ tually expoSed to the sight and conversation of Wallace ; and that she could not shut herSelf up with Eleonora, becauSe she So nearly reSembled her amiable brother; she Saw no proSpedt of ^ felicity, but with Sir Edward RuSsly, who had So long, and So tenderly loved her; who had faithfully kept the Secret which she had discovered ; who had indulged her in all her little foibles about VVallace; who had contributed to amuSe her embarrassed mind by a thouSand attentions ; vrho had promiSed that she should live, even when she v/as his wife, in every reSpedt as she pleaSed ; and that he would never See her but when the sight of him would be agreeable to her. The last stroke of complaiSance touched her extremely. Considering -
F 3	alfo
102	The HisTORy of
alSo that if she determined to marry him., she should pay him the higher compliment, by giving him her hand before Wallace was irrecoverably lost to her ; she took that Sudden reSolution to fix the time four or five days before that wshich would cut off all her hopes.
After having Spent about an hour in her own apartment, refiedting on the probable conSequences of the step which she had taken, she returned to her lover, with a more chearful air than she had when, she left him. On his expressing his transports upon the occasion, and pidturing the delight which he should feel in trying to make every hour of her life happy, “ Only keep “ your word. Sir Edward,” Said she, “ and carry me into the country as Soon “ as I become yours. I have nothing y further to fay.”
MiSs Wallace, Surprized at the odd-neSs of her behaviour, attempted, tho’ with all the delicacy of friendship, to rally her a little upon the strange ab- ^ ruptneSs in her behaviour: but finding
that
Mr. WALLACE. log that she made no reply, and that her raillery did not extort a single Smile from her, she left her with Sir Edward, and retired to her own room.
Sir Edward would have taken advantage of this fortunate moment to consult her about Several things relating to the necessary preparations for the approaching ceremony, but she desired not to hear of them, faying, “ that she “ should be ready, and doubted not “ but that he would be So too.”
There was one Subjedt, however, about which his extreme generosity vmuld not Suffer him to be negligent, though she had not once thought of it. He went immediately to his lawyer, and ordered a Settlement of two thousand pounds a year on her, to be drawn up with the utmost expedition, lest any accident should happen to him before it could be executed: he alSo made his will, and left her an equivalent. He then informed her of what he had done, and she thanked him for his generous care of her, adding, “ that she neither
F 4	y queS-
104 Th@ HisTORy of
questioned his liberality nor his love “ at that time; only,” continued she, with Some emotion, remain my friend.”
“ Your friend, my Cecilia!” cried he ; “ Gracious Heaven! can I ever ceaSe to “ be your lover and your friend.^ No,
to the last moment of my existence ' “ shall I be both.”
He was proceeding with the most rapturous expressions and Solemn promiSes ; but she stopped him, and telling him that she had rather hear him upon any other Subjedl, turned the conversation instantly by aSking his opinion about a new book, which he had brought to her a few days before. All indifferent,' however, as she Seemed to be, she did not forget to order linnen, cloaths, &c. Suitable to the occasion to be prepared for her, and Suffered Sir Edward to inform her sister of her design in his favour.
Maria lifted up her hands and eyes, and laughed at the unaccountable conduct of Cecilia. MiSs Myers alfo, who
was
Mr. WALLACE. 105
was become her almost constant companion and humble copier, echoed her mirth upon the occasion.
Wallace, who had not had the least idea of her motives, and who, had he been left to his free choice, would have preferred her to her sister, thought her proceedings rather uncommon; but was sincerely rejoiced that his friend was likely to be happy.
While they were thus employed, Maria, by keeping late hours, and hurrying from one Scene of pleaSure to another, fell sick of a fever, which Soon roSe to siich a height as to be pronounced by the physicians very dangerous : in that fever she was carefully nurSed and. attended by Eleonora, as MiSs Myers was at that time gone home for a week. Cecilia alSo was very attentive about her Sister, though Sir Edward, who was in perpetual alarms lest she could catch it, intreated her not to^ confine herSelf too cloSely to the lick chamber, and watched every movement of her countenance, fearing there
F 5	should
' io6 The HisTORy of
should be any change in it: there was, indeed, a change ink very Soon; for the concern which she felt on Seeing Maria in that condition, and in So short a time after the loSs which she had already Sustained, gave a shock to her gentle Spirits too violent to be concealed.
Sir Edward, whom she repeatedly affured that she was in perfect health, and who did not believe that she was So much affecled at the illneSs of her sister, as she had not discovered So much love for her, began to fancy that he had found out the real cauSe of her Sorrow; which he imagined must have proceeded in a great meaSure from her having engaged herSelf to him; and from her thinking that if MiSs Brere-tqn should not recover, Wallace would be again at liberty. This refiedlion was a dagger to his heart ; but though it pained him So Severely, he was determined to a6t nobly, whatever he Suffered by his reSolution. One day, therefore, while he was sitting by her, when she was in tears On her sister’s account, he Said, “ Do not give way,
« my
■t
(
Mr. WALL ACE. 107
my dearest MiSs Cecilia, to a Sorrow “ which must injure your health, if “ thus indulged ; nor do not think So “ meanly of me as to believe that I will “ not readily Sacrifice my felicity to com.-“ plete yours, though you are underen-“ gagements to me; for be affured, that if MiSs Brereton should not recover, “ and if Wallace should be once more free, I will resign you,, though Such a Surrender be attended with the loSs ‘‘ of my peace, and though my life ‘‘ be endangered by it.”
She looked at him sixedly for a moment, and then, giving him her hand. Said, “ Generous RuSsly, this is too “ much ; I did not expedl, nor will I ‘‘ accept of Such a proof of your ef-“ teem ; never will I marry a man “ by whom I am not freely choSen. But there is one thing. Sir Edward, which you will not, I am Sure,, from ‘‘ the nobleneSs of your Spirit, refuSe me. If my Sister should die, poor “ Wallace will meet with a great diS-“ appointment with regard to her for-tune, unleSs she leaves it to him, of F 6	‘‘ whidi

which I do not believe she thinks ‘‘ about; let me, therefore. Sir Ed-“ ward, by your friendly hand, make “ up this lofs to him.”
She could fay no more; tears prevented her from going on; while the enraptured Sir Edward Swore upon her dear Soft hand, to comply with every the {lightest hint of that kind from her; but as MiSs Brereton recovered Soon aftewards, things proceeded in the way intended.
On the day first appointed, Sir Edward invited his friends to his marriage. Cecilia was pundlual. She was dreffed elegantly plain; she was only adorned with Some of the jevrels which her stover had preSented to her; they were very brilliant, and she wore them in compliment to him. She, a few days before, obliged MiSs Wallace to accept of a bank note, that she might provide a dreSs Suitable for the occasion.
The
Mr. WALLACE. 109
The new Lady RuSsly appeared with a calmneSs and compoSure extremely agreeable to her huishand, who was all tendernest and tranfport.
As Soon as the ceremony was over, the post-chariot attended at the church-door, according to her request. Having taken leave of her Sister, and wished her happineSs ; having wished alSo hap-pineSs to Wallace, who, for the first and last time, modestly Saluted her; she threw her arm round MiSs Wallace’s neck, and Said, “ Farewel, Eleonora! “ May you be as happy as you deServe “ to be.” She then stepped^ hastily into the chariot, and did not cast another look at her brother.
Sir Edward, who adored her perSon, and was charmed with her resolution. Seated himSelf by her side. During the journey he behaved witli all the affection of a hushand, joined to all the tenderneSs of a lover.
They stopped on the road to take refreshment, and afterwards to dine..
She
/
jio The HisTORy of
She ate little, but appeared eaSy and chearful, though she looked exceed-ingly pale. Upon his giving looSe to the joy which he felt in being possessed of her, “ I will do all in my power,” Said she, ‘‘ to make you a Sociable ‘‘ companion; but do not expedt too “ much from me.”
In a few days aSterwards, MiSs Brere-ton was married to Wallace: at his desire, they retired to the honSe where he first Saw her, and which now belonged to him. He was polite and. reSpedtful, and affumed a tender behaviour proper to the occasion, which, through the force of Self-flattery, she believed to be sincere, and returned itt with great fondneSs. MiSs Wallace and MiSs Myers attended them to the village, to which MonSon immediately followed her.
Eleonora, who truly loved Cecilia, felt a real Sorrow at her departure : she. had now no creature to whom she could open her boSom, but her brother; and as she imagined that he was very-
fond
/
Mr. WALLACE. m
fond of his wife, whom she could not esteem, she concluded that he would have little leiSure to listen to her. MiSs Myers she by no means liked. Their tempers, indeed, were So totally different, that they could not possibly be Suitable to each other : she therefore Spent hours and hours alone, walking in the gardens, which were exceedingly pleaSant, as nature was in all her vernal beauty. They were laid out in the modern taste, and many parts of them were bounded by hedges, cut in Such a manner as to admit a view of the distant country, beyond the fields.
Having wandered by herSelf, one evening, to the bottom of a long graSs* walk, she Sat down upon a circular bench under one of the venerable oaks which Surrounded her. On that bench the stuttering of birds rouzed her from the reverie into which she had been plunged. Observing a tint remarkably^ beautiful in the plumage of the father of the little feathery detachment,
• as he stew by her into the tree,- she stepped upon the feat in order to have-
a nearer
112 The HisTORy of
a nearer view of him : and So interit was she in making her observations, that her foot flipped, as flie was near the edge, and she fell upon the graSs.
The violence of the fall stunned her for a moment; but when she recovered, imagine her Surprize at the sight of MonSon endeavouring to raiSe her from the ground in his arms.
She Screamed with terror and astonishment ; and as Soon as she could find words, alked him how he came there, ^and begged him to let her go.
“ Not till I am affured that you are “ not hurt, Mifs Wallace,” Said he.
“ I am not hurt,” replied flie, haf-tily; “ but do pray leave me.”
“ Do not be offended witff me, my “ dearest MiSs Wallace,” Said he, leading her to the bench, and fitting down by her ; “ but condeScend to hear me “ one moment. Unable to live with-y out Seeing you,” continued he, “ or'

‘‘ Ardently hoping that yon would ** return thither this evening, I had just - cccupied my station behind that tree,
“ when I Saw you fall. The terror “ which Seized me, lest you should have “ received any harm, made me re-“ gardlefs of every thing ; and I leaped “ over the hedge to give you assistance,
“ not staying to consider that you “ would be both Surprized, and, per-“ haps, angry at the liberty vshich I “ had taken. My fervent love, my “ tender anxiety for your Safety, threw me off my guard, and occasioned y this my Sudden appearance before

“ you, which you will, I hope, when “ you refiedt upon the motives by “ which I was aduated, pardon.'*
Eleonora listened to this Speech of her lover with her head drooping, and she trembled from the violence of her emotions. When he pauSed, she just lifted up her eyes towards him, and Said, “ I thank you, sir, for the affist-“ ance which you have afforded me,
“ and intreat you to leave me,”
‘‘ I will, madam,” replied he, “ I “ will go, since you insist upon my “ immediate departure, as you aS-“ siire me, that you are not injured by “ your fall : but yet, MiSs Wallace,” added he, stopping and looking tenderly on her, “ May I not be permitted “ to flatter mySelf that you would re-“ ceive honourable propofals from me ? ‘‘ I blush to think that I ever pre-“ Sumed to offer any other. Oh ! Mils “ Wallace,” continued he, finding that she made no anSwer, “ Do I Sue y for an unreasonable permission ?”
Eleonora
/
Mr. WALLACE. 115
Eleonora was Silent, becauSe she was really unable to'open her lips. His persisting in Spite of all her indifference, to love, and to follow her; and his anxious care for her Safety, together with the tremor which interrupted his articulation, lest she should be too much offended with him, touched her to Such a degree, that she with the utmost difficulty concealed her Sentiments. A deep sigh first issued from her agitated boSom, in Spite of her efforts to SuppreSs it; and upon being earnestly re-urged to Speak, she turned from him and burst into tears.
This behaviour distradled MonSo'n, who did not in the least gueSs the meaning of it. Having thrown him-felf at her feet, and implored her for-givenefs a thoufand times for appearing in that attitude before her; she at last, with a weak voice Scarce to be heard. Said, “ I am not angry now, Mr. Mon-“ Son; but let, me beg you to leave “ me.”
I will.

“ I will, indeed I will, MiSs.Wal-“ lace,” replied he; “ but whence ‘S ariSe thoSe tears ^ They'pierce me to “ the Soul; they must certainly have “ been occasioned by Some Secret “ Sorrow which preys upon your “ mind. Would I might know! “ would I could dry them ! But I am “ too importunate ; it is my anxiety “ for your peace which makes me So : “ it is nothing but the ardor of my “ love for you, indeed it is nothing elSe. I woiild rather die than give “ you a moment’s diSquietude; but “ I cannot bear to fee you unhappy.”
Eleonora, finding that he did not offer to stir from her, roSe up in order to leave him. He stepped after her, and caught her by the hand. ‘‘ You are “ going,” faid he, “ and will not “ Ipeak to me ; you weep, and you will not acquaint me with the “ cauSe of your tears. What must I “ think of this mournful silence, MiSs Wallace
No-
\
Mr. WALLACE, u;
Nothing,” Said she, with a sigh. Her face was covered with blushes, while she drew away her hand, and ran down the walk, leaving him with his eyes fixed on her as long as they could See the objed of their admiration.
When she reached the houSe, she' gave diredly a free vent to the unea-fineSs which the unexpeded prefence of MonSon had excited; and while she condemned the indiScreet proceedings of the lover, she esteemed, nay even felt, a fort of affedion for the man.
Frequently were her diSquieting re-fledions renewed; for frequently did she fee him paSs by the houfe, fome-times thrice, fometimes oftener in a day, and she hardly ever stirred out without meeting him; but he never attempted to fpeak to her. By thefe refiedions her fpirits were very much lowered, and the manner in which she lived at her brother’s did not contribute to raife, them.
As
ii8 The HisTORy of
As Soon as MiSs Brereton became Mrs. Wallace, MiSs Myers, at her invitation,
accompanied her down to H----------;
and by her artful behaviour and groSs flattery made herSelf So very necessary in the despicable charadler of an humble friend, that she could not exist a moment without her, especially when Wallace was at his Chambers, where he constantly and assiduoussy attended. So Successful were the endeavours of MiSs Myers to pleaSe Mrs. Wallace, that she frequently received little preSents from her, which, as she had but a Small fortune, vrere very acceptable, by enabling her to make a more elegant appearance than she could otherwiSe have done. But as MiSs Wallace was alSo still more in need of thoSe little civilities, and as the Sister of her hushand was still better entitled to them, Maria divided her favours among Eleonora and Die Myers. As the division of her favours, however, was not at all agreeable to the latter of thoSe ladies, who chofetobe poffeffed of every thing which MiSs Wallace had to bestow; she began to
think,
Mr. WALLACE. iig
think, that she could only hope to be the reigning favourite, by lessening the merit of Eleonora in the eyes of her Sister, till she made her Situation too irkSome to be Supportable. When she had by artful insinuations and oblique hints carried her point, and drove Eleonora out of the houSe, she should govern Maria, she imagined, just as she pleaSed.
While MiSs Myers was forming Such designs, an unlucky occurrence facilitated the execution of them.
Mrs. Wallace, though extremely fond of her hushand, endeavoured, be* fore they were married, to perSuade him to decline all busineSs, as her fortune was large, and the marriage of her younger sister with a baronet had, notwithstanding that fondneSs, more than once forced a wish from her, that she had married a gentleman, at least, if not a title.
This wish was treaSured up by the - penetrating MiSs Myers, and she
availed
120 The HiSTORy of
availed herSelf of it in order to forward the proSecution of her Schemes. With the most refined dexterity she endeavoured to Sow distention between Wallace and his sister; and as Maria always stew to her upon any little diSgust either to her hushand’s behaviour or to the carriage of MiSs Wallace, she never failed to side with her against them, magnifying every trivial fault which she discovered in them, till it became too flagrant to be endured. To irritate Mrs. Wallace the more, she tried to put her out of conceit with her situation; made frequent mention of Sir Edward and Lady RuSsly ; told her, “ that she always thought Sir Ed-“ ward was a mighty pretty gentle-
man, was certain that my lady must “ be vastly happy with him, and Sup-“ poSed that her ladyship would come “ to town in the winter; not doubting; ‘‘ but that Sir Edward would comply “ with every thing of which her lady-“ ship approved.”
Expressions of this kind, generally accompanied with Smiles, or rather
Sneers,
Mr, WAL L AC E. 121
Sneers, at all that either Wallace- or Eleonora Said or did, and with endeavours to turn them into ridicule, tho* in So artful a manner that they could not well Seem to be offended without appearing very ill-natured, brought Mrs. Wallace by degrees to follow her example ; but MiSs Myers often pushed her Satirical vein So far as to force him to quit the room. Whenever he, felt himSelf too much hurt to stay with her, she cried, even before Eleonora, if she remained behind, ‘‘ BleSs me ! Sure Mr.
“ Wallace cannot take what I Said “ amiSs; I protest I only meant to
rally him ; but Sure he cannot take “ it Seriousty : people must be mon-“ stroussy captious, indeed, who are “ offended at Such trifles.”
TheSe hints, together with the observations which they obliged her to make on the most minute circumstances in the behaviour of her hushand and sister, raifed in the mind of Maria, Suspicions and jealousies, distrusts and SurmiSes, for which there was not the (lightest foundation, and which would VoL. L	G	pro- X
122 The Historv of probably never have entered into her head, had they not been instilled into it by the malicious ingenuity of MiSs Myers ; who, in a very short time, had the Satisfadion to find that her Schemes had Sufficiently diSquieted Eleonora, who, being pepetually on the Spot, Saw and heard more than her brother, tho* she Saw and heard enough to be greatly diSpleaSed with the condud of his wife’s companion.
In order to render Eleonora still more diSagreeable to Maria, MiSs Myers appealed to her upon Wallace’s refuSal to comply with every thing required by his wife, though he treated her both with tenderneSs and reSped, and alked her, ‘‘ If she did not think “ that her brother was to blame, and “ how she should like to be So treated “ by an hushand ?” And upon her making no reply, as she was fearful of having her words misinterpreted, added, “ Aye, I See by your Silence what “ your thoughts are.” And when she leit the room laid, “ Did you obServe “ how Sulky Mist Wallace looked,
y and
Mr. WALLACE. 1*5
and that she would not Speak; she “ fancies, I SuppoSe, that her brother “ is always in the right, and was pro-voked at me for taking notice of his “ behaviour.”
TheSe, and a thouSand other Speeches ^ of the Same Sort, whefted Maria, already but too much inclined to feel diS-pleaSure at her hushand’s manners, tho* she still loved his perSon, and-animated her to oppoSe him perpetually. Vexed, however, as he was at the treatment which he received from her, he dropped not a Single word with wshich she could reasonably be offended : nay, when he Saw her in a capricious and wilful humour, he strove to Soothe her, and to Smile her into a better mood ; and often would he certainly have made an agreeable alteration in her carriage to him, iS MiSs Myers, who began to grow weary of the dull amuSements of a village, had hot inSpired Maria with a contempt for So stupid a place, by wondering that she was not tired of the fame thing over and over again, and that she would bury herSelf alive, v/hen

there were So many places of public diversion, as Southampton, Bright-helmstone, Tunbridge, &c. &c. to make the Summer paSs away with chearfulneSs and Spirit.
A tour of this kind was highly relished by Mrs. Wallace, who really led but an indolent and muzzy life. After having therefore yawned out approbation of MiSs Myers’s lively hints, she told her that she would Ipeak to Mr. Wallace about them. She did So, when he returned to her in the evening ; and his anSwer was, ‘‘ that he had “ no objedtion to her going to any of the places which she mentioned.”
“ But you must go with me,” replied she.
“ It will be impossible for me,” Said he, “ to accompany you : for I have So many papers to examine af-“ ter this term, in order to prepare them for the next, that I shall have “ no leisure for pleasijrable excur-“ Sions.”
u Aye,”
Mr. WALLACE. 125
“ Aye,” replied she, “ this is the “ conSequence of your following that “ odious buSmeSs. I really think, “ that the fortune I brought, Mr. “ Wallace, was Sufficient to hinder “ you from being ever confined, like “ a poor mechanic, who comes down “ late on a Saturday night, and hur-“ ries away to town on the Monday “ morning, almost as Soon as day “ breaks. There is not, I am Sure, “ the least necessity for your plod-“ ding on in this plebeian manner.”
“ Nay now, my dear Maria,” Said he, endeavouring- to Smile her into complacency, “ you give one of the “ most learned professions a very low “ appellation indeed. Do you ima-“ gine that the Chancellor, the judges, See. look upon themfelves as plebeians, or that they appear to “ any body in So degrading a light “ Many of them have riSen from lower “ parts of their profession than I have yet pradifed.”

“ What does that signify,” Said she, “ I hate all buSineSs : I would have you “ live like a gentleman upon your fortune.”
“ Every body allows my profession “ to be genteel,” replied he ; “ I would “ willingly riSe in that, my dear, and ‘‘ improve your fortune, instead of de-“ creaSiPig it by living entirely upon in”
“ But if I am contented,” Said she, “ and want no addition to it, chooS-“ ing rather to live quite inde-pendent”—
‘‘ I am independent,” interrupted he : “ the man who SubSists by explaining “ the laws of his country, who is rea--“ dy to fee that justice is done between “ man and man, and who freely em-“ ploys his powers for that purpoSe, must be, certainly, independent.”
Pshaw,” cried she,” how you de-“ light in giving a wrong turn to my words : you know \:ery well what I
“ mean.
Mr. WAJLHACli. 127
“ mean. I would have you give up bu-SmeSs entirely.”
“And why should you have Such an “ aversion to buSmeSs ? If your father “ had been of your way of thinking, “ you would not have inherited luch a “ fortune, nor have made me happy : “ and should I deServe to be So, my “ dear Maria, were I to neglecst my “ duty in the Same profession ? It is “ my highest ambition to tread in his “ steps, and to form my conduD by “ his example; whoSe probity, honour, “ and diligence, were his shining ac-“ complishments. The daughter of a “ counsellor cannot, I hope, be hurt, “ by being a counsellor’s wile.”
As he was just then called out of the room to a neighbour who waited for his opinion, Mrs. Wallace made no reply; but the moment he was gone, MiSs Myers laughed, and Mrs, Wallace felt herSelf not at all pleaSed; she rather peevishly demanded the cauSe of her mirth.

“ I fay nothing,” replied she, do “ not understand theSe things.”
“ Yon won’t understand them,” Said Maria, haughtily. “ You know well “ enough that I am in the right, only “ you must be on your brother’s side, “ to be Sure.”
As this was the Severest Speech which she had ever addressed to Eleonora, it

affedled her extremely; though she strove to SuppreSs her feelings. She made no anSwer, but the change in her countenance Sufficiently discovered the SenSations which Maria’s Speech had occasioned. She went out of the room Soon afterwards; MiSs Myers then failed not to throw out Some ill-natured remarks upon her Silence and departure.
Eleonora, upon her return, found not only a particular coolneSs in her sister towards her, but a great propensity to thwart her hushand in every thing which he happened to offer, while increasing Smiles of triumph very disagreeably e.nlivened the features of MiSs Myers. By theSe observations, Eleonora was extremely chagrined; the more So, becauSe, though she Saw thro* the little infernal arts of MiSs Myers, she was afraid to communicate her observations to her brother, as she was So high in Maria’s favour, lest Sne might, by So doing, create a difference between them. She more than ever wished to be removed from a houfe in

This wish she most earnestly v/anted to impart to her brother, and began to give Several hints; but he did not receive them in the manner she desired : for as he clearly Saw the prodigious influence which Die had over his wife, and had no opinion of her principles, he choSe to keep Eleonora with Mrs. Wallace, that she might be Some check upon her, TheSe Sentiments, hov/ever, he carefully concealed from his Sister, only encouraging her by the kindest behaviour to her when he was at home, and by furnishing her with money more than Sufficient for herex-pences, to bear her Situation with patience ; but all his affedtionate attentions could not render her situation tolerably eaSy; as both MiSs Myers and her sister continued to torment her by the most injurious methods they could think of.
During her persecutions, the elder brother of Mr. MqnSon’s father died

Upon this acquisition, the young gentleman threw himSelf a Second time at his father’s feet, and intreated his permiffion to marry Mifs Wallace, hoping that he could now Spare him an allowance adequate to the Support of a family.
“ And do you imagine,” replied the new baronet,.with an haughty air, “ that “ I shall now conSent to your marrying “ the daughter of an obScure country “ physician, whom I before thought “ beneath your notice.

Mr. MonSon, shocked and intimidated with this Severe anSwer, made no reply ; but waited with Submissive patience, till Sir Robert had performed his promiSe ; after the performance of which he wrote the following letter to Eleonora.
To MiSs W A I. L A C E.
“ Madam,

Eleonora received and read this letter with SenSations not easily to be described. She could by no means bring herSelf to comply with the contents of it; but she found, by the situation of her heart, that the refuSal would be attended with many painful emotions. She gave it to her brother, and desired his free opinion of it. He read it, and, having returned it with a Smile, Said, “ You, my dear Eleonora, are the “ best judge how far Such a propoSal “ is eligible or not: I cannot possibly “ determine for you in a point wherein your future happineSs is So nearly “ concerned.”

She hesitated a little, and then wrote the following lines :

“ THOUGH I cannot possibly ap-“ prove of your propoSals; as I ima-“ gine that you intended by them to “ confer happinefs on me by making “ them, as well as to procure what “ will, you believe, contribute to your “ own felicity, I must think mySelf

“ Eleonora Wallace.**
This letter she gave to her brother, who returned it with an approving Smile, and diSpatched it to Mr. Mon-Son.
MonSon, though he expeded no favourable reply, was , almost plunged into deSpair at the demolition of his designs; and as she had, from the day
on
Mr. WALLACE. 139
on which he stew to her assistance in the garden, avoided that Spot, he had no opportunity to Speak to her.
During theSe tranSadlions, Mrs. Wallace and MiSs Myers prepared to go to Tunbridge ; to which place, as the former could not well leave her by her-Self, Eleonora, much against her own inclinations and thoSe of her companions, was of the party.
As Soon as they departed from the village, MonSon, who had informed himSelf of all their motions, followed them on the wings of love, and had the transporting pleaSure to See his dear Eleonora the objeft of universal admiration ; yet he Saw her neither elated with her conquests, nor diSpoSed to turn any of them to her own advantage. As she always appeared Serious, however, nay, rather melancholy, he could not be Sure that Some happy man had not found the way to her heart, or that the pensiveneSs in her air had not been already occasioned shy

140 The HisTORy of
love. He knew not, in short, what to think: he even grew almost wild with thinking too miuch. He followed her every where ; she could not stir unobserved by him ; and he always fixed his eyes upon her in a manner which plainly discovered his anxiety and his tenderneSs. He became negligent of every thing but her ; he neither ate nor drank, nor ssept: in his languid looks and pallid complexion was strongly painted the torment which he endured. Yet dying as he was with desire to accost her to alk her to dance, and to treat her with all the polite freedoms iiSual at Such places, he checked him-felf; though in So doing, he felt the most uneaSy SenSations. The fear of displeasing her, to promote whoSe hap-pineSs he would have Sacrificed his life, frequently kept him at a distance from her; and the uncertainty he was in, concerning her attachment to another man, as he wished to be the Sole poiielSor of her heart, half distradled him.
He
Mr. WALLACE. 141
He was the most alarmed by Mr. Bladen, a young man of fashion, with an Independent fortune, and next heir to an old uncle, who was a baronet.
This gentleman had been one of the warmest admirers of MiSs Wallace, from the first day of her appearance at Tunbridge ; but as he had been guilty of none of thoSe freedoms v/hich are Sometimes taken by a man of Superior rank and forune in life to the woman whom he admires, and had behaved with great reSpedt, she had never treated him differently from the reSc of her general acquaintance.
This behaviour of her’s, however, though it was no encouragement, was a proof, at least, in his opinion, that she had no aversion to him ;'and as he really was in love with her, he reSolved to improve the acquaintance which he ' had made in the family, that he might have more opportunities to endeavour to render himSelf agreeable to her.
His
142 The Historv of
His assiduities, in conSequenCe of the force of his passion for her, brought on, by imperceptible gradations, a familiarity between them, which though perfectly innocent on her side, gave him a Satisfadion which he hardly knew how to conceal. But tho’ he began to flatter himSelf that a man of his fortune, family, and figure, could not possibly be refuSed by her, his notions about happineSs were too delicate to Suffer him to think of owing it merely to their influence upon the woman of his choice; and he wished too ardently to be perSonally loved, to hazard an abrupt declaration before he had made Some encouraging diScove • ries.
With theSe views he was perpetually near her; and as his proximity was never troublefomc, as he was officious without being impertinent, she was not offended by his behaviour. He was posse fled of every converSible talent; and often amuScd her mind when her thoughts were too intenSely employed about MonSon, whoSe looks alone proclaimed
Mr. WALLACE. 143
claimed the passion which he felt for her to every body but Bladen, who did not imagine, as he neither Ipoke to her, nor danced with her, as he might have done, with no impropriety, in So public a place, that they were at all acquainted, or that he viewed her in a different manner from the gentlemen down there, whoSe admiration her pleasing perSon, and the amiable modesty of her manners, naturally excited.
Bladen, thus Situated, was quite inattentive to MonSon, and quite eaSy about him. Not So inattentive was MonSon to the motions of his rival, nor So eaSy concerning him. His continual and permitted, though innocently permitted assiduities about MiSs Wallace, rouzed a SuSpicion in his love-pierced breast, that he was the man for whom she heaved So many sighs; that all her melancholy had been occasioned by the inclination which she felt for him ; and that the diScovery of a returned passion had removed it. The
chear-
144 The HiSTORy of
chearfulneSs he perceived was not aS-Sumed, for the continual proofs of his constancy for her, made her more Satisfied than Site had ever been ; as she began to hope that she should one day be happy with him, if his father died, or changed his Sentiments. If Mon-fon had known the true Source of the alteration which he perceived in Eleonora, he would have been highly delighted ; but by mistaking the cauSe of it, he was deeply pained. Nay, he was So immoderately jealous and discontented, that he forgot his generous promise to leave her free to accept of the first advantageous offer which proved agreeable to her ; and from a caprice not uncommon in lovers, even in thoSe who love with the greatest Sincerity, instead of viewing her with glances Submissively tender, he looked at her with a coldneSs and indifference which stabbed her to the Soul.
When they both appeared in the rooms, or on the walks, instead of fixing his eyes upon her with his uSual ardor, devouring her with the gaze of
fondneSs,
Mr. WALLACE. 145
fondnefs, he turned hastily from her, as if she had filled him with horror ; and at a ball, one evening, when she was taken out by Bladen to dance a minliet, he immediately quitted the place.
• His departure was not unmarked by Eleonora, who, diScreet as ssie was in the management of her looks in particular, and her whole condudl; in general, towards him, might properly have been Said to live on his Smiles ; she therefore Sighed at his precipitate retreat; and as she was at first far from divining the cauSe of it, a thoufand apprehensions concerning his health crowded thick upon her ; which were confirmed by his not returning ; for though he died with impatience to behold her again, he determined to conquer his inclination for that evening, at least ; and on the next morning, upon the walks, just as he was coming up to her, he crossed over to the other fide, purpoSely to avoid her.
VoL. I.	H	This

This behaviour was too cutting to be Supported. She had passed the night in racking anxiety about his health; and, at the sight of him at a distance,, prepared to receive him with a Smile of SatisSadtion, while her bofom glowed with pleaSure to See him well enough to come abroad. But this frigid negledt, this apparent contempt, hurt her So much, that fearing a public detedlion of her Sentiments, she pleaded a Sudden indiSpoSition, and went home, accompanied by Mr, Bladen, who would attend her to the door.
When she found herSelf alone in her own apartment, she gave a free vent to her afflidlion ; and after having, with a flood of tears, lamented the cruel change in Mr. MonSon, began to take herSelf most Severely to talk, for having ever given way to an inclination which she could not hope to gratify under the Sandlion of discretion, and which she, therefore, should have op-poSed with all her fortitude. “ Yet “ why,” Said she, in a Soliloquy,
y Why
I
Mr. WALLACE. 147
Why did he pretend to love me ? “ Why did he flatter me with a belief “ that I was dear to him ? Had he ‘i been Silent, I never should have en* couraged Such a hope. I should “ undoubtedly have diScerned his ami-“ able attradUons; but I should not “ have been So much affedted by ‘‘ them. Yet let me not blame him : “ all men will do So. They employ “ their talents to impoSe upon' our credulity, and they find us but too “ ready to listen to their enticing “ language.'*
With theSe refledbions, and a thousand firm reSolves did Eleonora endea-vour to fortify her tender heart against MonSon ; but to no purpoSe : the foft-neSs of his former behaviour rofe to her memory, and the found of his tuneful voice still vibrated in her charmed ear.
In the afternoon of that day, Mr. Bladen came again to enquire after her health. She was alone, pale, dejedbed, unhappy. Her Situation increasing the

prejudices which he had before in her favour, raiSed his passion to Such a height, that he was no longer master of himSelf. In a few, but very explicit words, he declared his love, and made propoSals which not many women would have rejeded.
MiSs Wallace, though extremely Surprized at So unexpeded a declaration, as her pride was not dazzled, nor her heart moved by it, calmly thanked him for the good opinion he had conceived of her; but told him, “ that it was really not in her power “ to accept of his genteel and gene-“ rous offers.”
He was at sirst startled at her chilling refuSal; but as Soon as he was able to Speak, made uSe of all his elocution to prevail on her to repeal So Severe a Sentence, and to pronounce a more gentle one, affuring her, “ that he
would wait her own time, and that “ he should think no concession too “ great for the acquisition of Such a “ heart as hers.”
Her
Mr. WALLACE. 149
Her anSwer was decissve against him : she positively declared, “ that nothing “ could difiodge the Sentiments which were rooted in her mind,” and uttered her definitive reply with So peremptory an accent, that he at last quitted her, without being able to learn from her the true cauSe of his re-pulSe.
In his way home to his lodgings he met an intimate acquaintance, and immediately told him what had passed between him and Mils Wallace, expressing all the discontent of a discarded lover; and expressing it with So little circumSpedlion, that it was Soon circulated in every corner of the town ; and consequently Soon reached the ears of MonSon, who was on the walks; and was So much transported with joy to find that he had been mistaken, that he became very angry with himSelf for entertaining Suspicions injurious to MiSs Wallace; and accuSed siimSelf for having been the cauSe of her abrupt departure from the walks.

“ Oh!” Said Die, thinking to vex him, “ she is at home, very “ ill.”
She was going to add Some SarcaS-tical restedlions upon his condudl, which would not have been very agreeable to him ; but he did not stay to hear them.
He ran, he rather stew, to their lodgings, and though he never presumed to visit there, instantly demanded to be admitted to MiSs Wallace.

The Servant of the houSe did not know him ; but as he had the appearance of a gentleman, opened the parlour door, without even ashing his name.
Eleonora, who was sitting at a table, in a melancholy attitude, her head leaning on her hand, as Soon as she cast her eyes on him, not being able to expreSs the Several struggling passions which too powerfully agitated her mind, Sunk back in her chair, and fainted away.
MonSon, alarmed, distradled at her situation, was going to call for help; when she opened her eyes. Seeing him stand before her, pale, motionleSs, and Scarce able to Speak, her tenderneSs for him got the better of the reSoiution which she had made to give up all thoughts of him for ever; and recol-ledling only that part of his behaviour which had So deeply diSquieted her, she looked at him with eyes SuffuSed with tears, and in tremulous aecents, cried, “ What did I Say or do, Mr.

“To implore your forgiveneSs,” replied he, falling on his knees, “ for “ a foolish jealouSy, which I shall al-“ ways reproach mySelf for, though I “ shall Spend the remainder of my life “ in making atonement for my con-“ temptible want of penetration. Yet “ let me Say, my dearest Mil's Wal-“ lace, that since I have had the hap-“ pineSs of being acquainted with you, “ I never felt a joy equal to the hear-“ ing, that you esteem me enough to “ be concerned at my folly ; though, “ at the Same time, I feel the greatest “ uneasineSs that you should endure “ the least anxiety on my ac-count.”
She Smiled on him through her tears, while he Spoke, and gave him her hand to raiSe him ; but could not utter a Syllable. Her heart was too full.

He drew a chair cloSe to her ; he held her hands in his; he begged her only to tell him whether she pardoned him ; he thanked her for having reserved herSelf for him ; declared, “ that “ he should be the happiest of men, if “ her health and Spirits had not Suffered “ too much on his account.'*
She listened to him, she looked at him with a transporting emotion, which she had never felt before, to find him still true to her, still fond of her, to an unexpedled degree (for his looks were infinitely more expressive than his words) ; and to find alSo, that he had never been difjlea ed with her, but thro’ excefs oi love, gave her joy unutterable. ■'

His passion then rising beyond the bounds which he had prescribed to himSelf, and as he Saw her appear still faint and languid, he ventured to throw one arm round her neck, that she might gently recline on his shoulder. He was just going to take advantage of this love-inSpiring attitude, by Seizing a tender kiSs, when she at once recovering her strength and Speech, cried, rising with her face covered with blushes, “ Hold, Mr. Monfon ; I “ have pardoned what is already past, but do not preSume upon that par-don. If all that you ever told me is true ; if you still love me with your pretended Sincerity, you must be content to love in the manner “ which I chooSe : you must not offer “ to See me but in the way you have “ hitherto done; nor must_ you at-“ tempt to take any liberties, if chance “ should produce private meetings be-tween us.”
“ I will conform, my dear, my be-“ loved angel,” Said he, “ to every .	thing which you deSire ; only let me

Besides, when I thought “ So, I pre-SuppoSed that you would be happier with another than with “ me. And may I not now fiattet “ my Self with being the perSon ne-ceffary to your happineSs ?’*
She Smiled on him ; but desired him to leave her *, affuring him, “ that “ while he continued to behave as he “ had done till he grew jealous, he “ should have nothing to fear on her “ part.”
He left her In a state of mind easily to be conceived ; and his tenderneSs had So entirely restored her tranquility, that when her sister and Die came home, they found no traces of her indisposition remaining.

This event, and the honourable addresses which she had received from Mr. Bladen, blew the Sparks of envy in MiSs Myers’s bofom, into Such a flame, that she treated her in a manner which would have been absolutely insupportable, if she had not been just rendered So eaSy with regard to Mon-Son, that every thing elSe was of no conSequence to her.
Whem Eleonora and Mr. MonSon appeared again in public together, their looks had quite a new expression in them : their confidence in each other was now So much increaSed, that he tvatched every motion cf her eyes with the most pleasing attention, while she, delighted with the agreeable change in him, cast on him, when she thought that she was unobServed, the most bewitching Smiles. Animated by them, he Sometimes ventured, under the favour of a crowd, to get near her, and whiSper a few tender words in her ear, as she passed ‘ to steal her hand, and to, preSs it, under pretence of assisting her to move from place to place ; though

the Spiteful Die always endeavoured to discover the little affedlionate proofs of their tenderneSs, and repeat her observations upon them, full of malignity and acrimony, to Maria. She went still farther; she contrived to have Sir Robert informed of the continuance of his Son’s attachment to the amiable Eleonora.
When Wallace came down to eScort his family to London, his siSter gave a minute detail to him of evcrv thino;

which had pasted between her and her two lovers. Ele only replied, His “ pity, my dear, that you cannot ap-“ prove of So unexceptionable an of-“ fer as Bladen’s. But I well know, “ that we cannot always make our “ inclinations fubServient to our in-“ terest.”
He Said no more to her; but Mrs, Wallace mentioned the affair, when they were all together, and Said, ‘fthat “ Eleonora had, in her opinion, adled “ very'weakly, in refusing Such a pro-“ digious offer; an offer which a woman
^	X	XXi»lUK.Y Ui
“ man with nothing must not expeft “ to receive every day : but that she “ really thought both she and her bro-“ ther might be called fortunate peo-pie, and had it in their power to “ make themSelves very happy if they V knew how to be So.”
“ I am very fortunate, my dear ‘‘ Maria,” replied Wallace with a Smile, “ in possessing your love; and “ do I not, by returning that af-“ Section, promote our mutual hap-“ pineSs
“ You have always an anfwer rea* dy,” Said she; “ but what I Said was more particularly addressed to “ Eleonora, who has, I think, aded “ very foolishly in negleding to take “ Bladen when he was in the hu-*
“ mour; but, poshbly, she may be “ glad of him, or of any body, by “ and bye.”
Eleonora coloured at this reprobf of her sister’s; but Said nothing: while Wallace, who Saw and who pitied her

confusion, replied, “ We are not com-“ petent judges of the motives by “ which others are adluated, my dear ;
it is therefore hard to condemn her y with So much Severity.’*
“ Oh! her motives are mighty “ well known,” cried she, with a taunting air; “ her partiality for that im-“ pertinent fellow MonSon, is no Se-“ cret, I assure you.”
MiSs Wallace was here strongly provoked to reply in a manner that would have occasioned a Scene of altercation between her brother and his wife ; but her love for that brother, and her contempt for that wife, only prompted her to turn the conversation, by ashing a question quite foreign to the Sub-jedt on which they were talking, and to leave the room Soon afterwards.

Wallace kept up a regular correspondence with his father and mother; and as he found that the pradfice of the former daily decreaSed, and that his younger Sister’s continued bad state of health made their expences run higher than ever, he carefully remitted to them a very handSome addition to their income ; informing them, that he would entirely take his sister Eleonora under his protedtion ; but never made the least mention of the un-kindnefs with v/hich she was treated by Maria and her companion, nor Said a single word of either of her lovers, though there had alv/ays Subsisted the stridtest intimacy between him and his sister Nancy.
Sir Edward RuSsly wrote frequently CO Wallace, and in all his letters Spake

Soon after the beginning of the winter, Wallace and his wife, at her request. Settled in an elegant houSe in town ; and So infatuated was she still with MiSs Myers, that she insisted on her being with her as often as she could come to her. Die wanted, indeed, very little pressing; but as she could not procure the removal of MiSs Wallace, she determined to make her time pafs in the most diSagreeable manner.
Sir Robert Monfon having been told that his Son was more than ever attached to MCs Wallace, Sent for him ; informed him, that it was, in his opinion ; high time for him to marry; and recommended a young lady to whom, had not his affeftions been engaged, he could not have well made any objection. “ Her father and I,” continued Sir Robert, “ have talked over the “ matter ; and if you hope for my future favour, you must immedi-ately make your addresses to her.”
Monfon^
Mr. WALLACE. 163
MonSon, whoSe love for Eleonora every hour encreaSed, intreated his father once more to pity him, to See the objeft of his passion, and to conSent to his happineSs; but, upon receiving an anSwer totally opposite to his wishes, he roSe up and Said, “ I have done all, “ fir, in not marrying contrary to
your inclination, that can be reafon-“ ably required from a Son; and no-“ thing upon earth shall oblige me to “ marry against my own.”
Before this determination of Mon-Son’s, however, was known, MiSs Myers, ever ready to teaze Eleonora, circulated a report in a very positive way, that MonSon was aftually under the most Solemn engagements to the lady whom his father had chofen for him.
Eleonora, though she did not absh-lutely give credit to the report which Mifs Myers circulated with So much confidence, was not unastcsted by it. As she shad not permitted him to write to her, and as she had not lately Seen him

accidentally, it threw a gloom over her features, which she was not able to conceal. Unluckily too, it happened ' that she Saw him, for the first time afterwards, at the play, in a box fronting her, in conversation with a very fine young v/oman, whom buSy fancy aS-Sured her to be the lady designed for him by his father.
As her appearance at the play that night was quite unpremeditated, both she and Mrs. Wallace being in company with a lady whoSe Servant kept places, MonSon did not in the least expert to See her ; and therefore continued chatting to the young lady by his side, during the greater part of the night; and whenever he turned his eyes towards the box in which Eleonora fat, she was hid from his fight by being placed behind a very tall woman. But as the Singularity of her Situation never once entered into her head, she gave him over, and her Spirits were So Sunk by the disappointment, that she could hardly keep her Seat.
In
Mr. WALLACE. 165
In getting out, there was a diSpute in the passage among Some young fellows who were ripe for a frolic, and obstructed their progreSs to their carriage.
MonSon passing by Eleonora, in the midst of this bustle, with the lady to whom he had been attached all die evening, and feeing her, unexpectedly, as pale as death, and just ready to faint, was excessively alarmed.
Begging the lady’s pardon wshom he was leading out, he darted .through the crowd, stew to Eleonora, and catching hold of' her hand. Said Softly, “ My ‘‘ dear MiSs Wallace, I did not.. “ imagine that I should have had the “ happineSs .of feeing you this even-“ ing.”
He was going to make a tender enquiry after her health; but she stopped him by replying, in a far different tone from that in which she had been accustomed to Speak to him ; “ No, sir;
“ i
i66 The History of
“ I can very readily believe, that I was neither expeded nor de-sired.”
“ Good Heaven! my dearest MiSs “ Wallace,” cried he, “ Why do you “ talk in this manner ? What has oc-“ caSioned the palenefs in your diSor-“ dered countenance ? Lean on me; let me Support you.”
Perceiving that she could hardly stand, he made an effort to Save her from falling, when she hastily striving to avoid him, Sunk absolutely lifeleSs into his arms.
This incident distressed him extremely, and increased the bustle: Mrs. Wallace and her company, in the mean time, who were before Eleonora, and who had been divided from her by the crowd, gained their coach. As Soon as they were Seated in it, they dispatched a Servant to look for Eleonora; and Soon afterwards were more Surprized than they had been upon having miffed her, to See her feebly

advancing. Supported by MonSon, who half distradted, both at her illneSs and at her behaviour, alked her tenderly, while he led her along, why she was So offended with him, and what had So much stuttered her Ipirits.
She only replied with a deep sigh ; and he was obliged to leave her in the coach, without receiving any anSwer to his fond enquiries.
When they came home, Maria, as Wallace staid out late upon buSineSs, reprimanded Eleonora for having made her wait, and for having loitered behind with MonSon, when she knew that he was going to be married to another worhan.
Poor Eleonora, half dead before, was now quite over-powered by the variety of passions which agitated her mind, and retired immediately to her chamber, where she Spent the night in sighs and tears.
In

In the morning, as Soon as she thought that her brother was stirring,, she went down to the parlour; and luckily finding him there alone, in-treated him to let her go home, telling him, til at she was far from well, and that nothing would ever restore her to health.
, Wallace, who was loth to part with her, as he loved, her affectionately, endeavoured to peisiuade her to remain with him, at least, till the return of Spring, and not to go and bury herSelf in the country, in the worst part of the winter ; but she begged So ’ earnestly for her removal, that he, conScious that his houSe was not So agreeable to her as he wished it to be, at last conSented to it, and procured a post-chaiSe for her, desiring Maria to let her maid go down with her to attend her upon the road.
As Soon as Eleonora had taken leave of her brother, MonSon, who had not cloSed his eyes all night, Sent
up

up his name, and in treated to See her; but an abfolute denial on her part obliged him to return home, where he wrote a very tender and Submissive letter, and Sent it by his own Servant, chargirrg him to wait for an anSwer; but it came shack to his hands unopened.
Wild at her proceedings, he made his man watch her every motion ; and when he heard of her Setting ost^ ordered a post-chaiSe immediately. Before he left London, Iiowever, he called upon Wallace at his chambers: and insisted upon h'is telling him the cauSe of his sister’s abrupt departure, and of her unuSual coldneSs to /■ him.
Wallace Very frankly replied, that she had not even mentioned his “ name, and that she was gone into “ the country for the shenesit of the air.”
“ She is ill then, poor girl!” Said MonSon with a melancholy sigh, which VoL. I.	I	he

“ Eleonora, Mr. iVtonSon,” replied he, “ is a good girl, and I sincerely “ wish, that she was not So much diS-“ approved of by your family; or at “ least, that she had never Seen “ you I am afraid that her diSap-“ pointment there fits heaVy on her “ heart.”
“ Do you believe that she really ef-“ teems me ? Oh my dear allace, “ could I be Sure of that!—But she “ parted from me in anger; and I “ shall not have a moment’s rest till “ she is reconciled to me. Indeed, “ indeed, my friend, I have done “ nothing to deServe her anger: it “ touches me too Sensibly. I cannot y bear it.”
The

The alteration in his voice while he uttered the few concluding words, convinced Wallace more than a thouSand Speeches, that they had been dictated by Sincerity ; as he stepped into the chaiSe, therefore, he wrung his hand, at parting, with all the affedtion of a brother, and with all the warmth of a friend.
The carriage which he occupied, by the velocity of its motion. Soon came in sight of Eleonora’s; but he would not overtake it, becauSe he was afraid of adding to the offence which he had unknowingly committed ; hovrever, he followed her to her father’s, who, with her mother and sister, received her with open arms.
Mbnibn alighted at the distance of a few yards, at a farm-hoaSe, in which he had ordered a Servant to hire an apartment for him ; and indeed Such a step was perfedt’y necessary to be taken; for the rapidity of the carriage, and the agitation of his mind,

had thrown him into a violent fever. He was carried ,to bed immediately, ^nd in a short time afterwards .Dr. Wallace, of whom the good people of the houSe were very fond, attended him. His appearance was quite unex-pedled by MonSon; for he had not been confulted upon the occasion.
.Dodlor Wallace found his patient extremely ill, though not in the least delirious. As the farmer’s wife, Mrs. .DobSon, who condujSted the dodlor into the room, called him by his name, MonSon started tip in his bed; and when he approached to feel his pulSe, Seized him eagerly by the arm, and ashed him earnestly after his daughter.	_	'
The doctor, who had been accuS-tomed to that question from the long indisposition of MiSs Nancy Wallace, replied, ‘‘ that she was very ill indeed, and that he had very Small hopes of her recovery.”

" But you will conSent, I hope,” laid the worthy doftor, ‘‘ to compoSe ‘‘ yourSelf 'till I procure the wished information from my daughter.”

The good old man, amazed to hear his patient run on in this manner, was at first inclined to think that he v/as light-headed ; though, upon refiedtion, nothing was uttered by him to Support that opinion. He therefore ordered Something to promote perSpiration, and left him to go to Eleonora; but before he quitted the room, MonSon repeatedly intreated him to return as Soon as he had Spoken to her.
As to Eleonora, she was not In better Spirits than her lover. Appearances were, in her opinion. So strongly against him, that she was miserable beyond expression, in believing him

faiSe. Pained exceedingly by this belief, as she could not stifle her a£-fedtion for him, thoroughly ashamed of her weakneSs, and dreading the taunts and jests of MiSs Myers upon a Subjedt which she wished to blot from her memory, she could not bear her situation; the inSolence likewife of that girl, and the unkindneSs of her Sister Wallace, confpired to strengthen the resolution which she had formed to return to her father. But as Soon as she began to extecute her designs, she repented of her precipitate retreat. The fwiftneSs with which the ehaiSe was. conveyed, instead of raiSmg her Spirits, depressed' them; becauSe the distance between her and MonSon was, she thought,by that SwiftneSs increaSed; and. she waSjOn her arrival at her father^s, taken out of the carriage more dead than alive. Imputing, however, the extreme languor which she felt, entirely to the fatigue which she endured from the journey, he was not alarmed; and as fie was immediately Sent for to the sick gentleman at Mr. PobSon’s, he had.
noS:
Mr. W A iL JL A C.D.	177
not time to obServe her real dejedlion ; but when he returned, he was, shocked at it, and began his interrogations, by ashing her, if she knew a Mr. Mon-fon.
Poor Eleonora, though she thought of nothing elfe, was yet quite astonished at her father’s question, and from a deadly pale, her face became red as Scarlet,
Do not be terrified,” Said the good old man ; “ but tell me every thing that you know about him; with “ which, indeed, I should have beem acquainted before.”
She then begged her father and mother to forgive her for having concealed from them an affair of Such importance to her future peace; but told them, “ that as she could not “ expels to have any advantageous “ connedlions with Mr, MonSon, she was not willing to flatter them with falSe hopes, and wished that she I 5	“ had
I he History or
“ had strength of mind enough to “ prevent her from dwelling upon liich uncertain expedations her-« Self.’*
She then related every circumstance? which had passed between her and her lover, and concluded with Saying, “ that her return into the country was “ determined on her being affured that she had for ever lost him, that “ she might try to drive him from her thoughts.”
As her father and mother found nothing blameable in her condud, they strove to cheat and encourage her as much as possible, especially the former ; though he deemed it more prudent not to Say a great deal in praiSe of it, till he had heard MonSon’s account of the matter. He, therefore, rofe to ga back to him.
“ Will not my dear father,” Said Ldeonora, stopping him, “ tell me ** how he came to know any thing

concerning Mr. MonSon, before he ‘‘ leaves me
“ When I come horne again, my ** dear child,'’ replied he, “ you “ shall be acquainted with every “ thing; till then, make yourSelf “ eaSy.”
When the dodfor entered Mr. Mon-i Son’s apartment, he found him much more cbmpoSed than he thought he would have been : that compoSure was partly owing to the pleaSstre which he felt at having met with the father of his JEleonora in his physician, in whoSe favour he was at first sight prejudiced, and partly frqrn his expedling to hear from her.
He raifed hiniSelf up in his bed, as foon as the dodtor appeared, agd cried, “ Well, Sir, do you bring “ rr(e any comfort from my dear “Eleonora?”
“ I am certain,” replied the dodlor. Smiling, “ that w^ere she to fee you in

MOnSon, as eager to fpeak as the dodtor was to hear, promiSed to Siib'mit to his regimen, and promote perSpi-ration, if he would but listeja to hi&^ story..
He then related what pasted betweem him and Eleonora, from his first interview with her, to his leaving her in the coach. Whem he mentioned his propofal for a private marriage,, he lamented in the most pathetic terms, his inability to do .more for her during the life of his father,, and cried out, in the warmth of‘his affediibn, “ Had,it been in my power, sir, I would have. ** made her a queen.”

The good old gentleman was sh-snoved with- the narrative which he had heard, and with the fervency with which his patient intreated to> be affured of his daughter*‘s pardon for the unknown fault which he had committed, that he replied, the tears gliS-tening in his eyes, “ My daughter, ** sir, believing you to be faithleSs, “ and not being able to bear a place “ in which every thing reminded her ‘‘ of your infidelity, came down in or-' “ der to endeavour to drive you from^ ** her memory.’**

MonSon had exerted himSelf in the delivery of his narrative, and his disorder had been So much increaSed by his agitation about Eleonora, that the docstor was alarmed; but imagining that his disorder had been occasioned only by the uneafineSs of his mind, he believed, that the sight of Eleonora would be the Surest remedy. H,e,. therefore, hastened home, and in a fe;w words acquainted her with the cauSe of Monfbn’s illneSs, and ddired her to go back with him, just to convince him, that he was no longer the objedt of her reSentment.
Eleonora, terrified at the intelligence concerning his health, but delighted to find that he came after her, and that , he still loved her So tenderly, most willingly accompanied her father, who leading her to the bed-side, told him, “ that he had brought him the best “ restorative which he had in his pof-“ Session; but on condition that he ne-ver attempted to think on her, with-out his father’s confent.

Eleonora having wept both from joy and grief; joy, to fee her lover again, grief, to See him So very much indiSpoSed; Sat down by him, and giving him her hand, begged him to take care of his health..
“ If you are no longer offend-cd with me, MiSs Wallace,” replied..

“ it is very plain,Said' the father, ** that she is no longer angry; but as “ I do not approve of her entering into any engagements of So Solemn a nature, without the conSent of all “ parties; she will not, I am certain,, “ urge my compliance with your re-quest, especially when she reflects upon the great impropriety, as well as injustice of an opposite conduct.

While he was every day gaining new strength, both the dodlor and Eleonora Wrote to Wallace an account of all that had passed ; who had hrmSelf just at that time received a piece of news of a very diSagreeabfe nature, the death of Sir Edward RuSsly, who expired in a few days, after every remedy had been taken to Save his life.
Lady Rufsly, though she never felt that afiedion for her hushand witte which he would gladly have inSpired Ker,. sincerely lamented his deceaSe, as he had ever behaved to. her in the most unexceptionable manner,, and had constantly endeavoured, by every Species of tendernefs and regard, to? make her happy. She regretted his

1^6 The Historv of
loSs, however, not as he was a fond hushand, but as a Sincere friend, who alone knew every Secret of her heart: as Such a friend, therefore, his loSs was considered by her as irreparable; and the remembrance of his extreme generosity, which was always alive, as he had left every thing to her, gave her perpetual disquietude; she could not alSo help reproaching herSelf for not having been able to return his love in the manner he wished, though she had never failed to take every method in her power to drive Wallace from her memory.
A Dilated by the most prudential motives. Lady RuSsly had, while Sir Edward lived, offered great violence to her inclination, by not inviting Mils Wallace to come and stay with her; but the death of her hushand gave a new turn to her ideas ; and as the days and hours became very iishSome, as she had no Society near her, to exclude the intrusion of melancholy re-fieDions, she thought that she might,

Mr. WALLACE. 187
without any impropriety, ash Eleonora to Spend a few months with her. > he, therefore. Sent a very obliging letter to her. Supposing that she was at her brother’s ; which letter he directly forwarded to her, and which, as Soon as she received, Sne communicated to her father and mother.
‘‘ Nothing, my dear child,” Said the dodtor, “ could have happened “ more fortunate. Accept of this in-vitation by all means. You will “ thereby have an opportunity to “ be grateful to the daughter of a “ man to whom your brother is in-“ debted for every thing he is possessed “ of, and of removing yourSelf from “ Mr. MonSon for a time ; the dearer he is to you, the more reaSon you “ ought to have to wish him well “ with his father.

There is more to be gained by mildneSs and patience, “ my dear, than you imagine : it is ** always, at least, worth while to try “ thoSe methods, which often cenci-“ liate the most perverSe tempers,, which force only renders more ob-“ durate; and if, after all, nothing “ should prove effeftual, you will have “ the conSolation to know, that you were not accessary to a breach be-“ tween a father and his Son ; that you, “ on the contrary, by quietly acqui-eScing with Sir Robert’s inclination,, and by reSolutely refusing to become the wife of his Son, without his en-“ tire approbation, not only cement; “ their union, but raife yourfelf in Sir “ Robert’s opinion. By So doing you y will certainly deServe the honour

which he refuSes to confer upon you; “ and if your lover is worthy of you, ‘‘ and the man of SenSe I take him to “ be, you must inevitably improve upon him alSo, and strengthen his “ passion for you by a diScreet resist-ance to it.”
Eleonora, who truly revered her father, listened to him with a dutiful attention, Subscribed to the justneSs of his Sentiments, and promiSed to obey him exadly.
In confequence of that promiSe, she wrote immediately a reSpedftil letter to Lady RuSsly, and prepared for her journey.
Monfon, who was now well enough to go to London, at his next visit at the dodtor’s, became acquainted with all that had paILd, and was strongly urged shoth by him and his daughter to return to town. It was Some time, however, before the latter, who, though she strove to conceal her inquietude from
her
t9o The History of
her lover, and Spoke nobly concerning prudential reaSons,, &c. &c. trembled as she Spoke, could prevail upon him to be compliant; but on her expatiating upon the hopes which there might be of Softening Sir Robert, by a Seeming conformity to his will, she carried her point; and he promiSed to Set out for London, when she entered upon her journey to O-------—
shire.
He kept his word. But Eleonora, though she had Summoned all her fortitude upon the trying occasion, was shaken when the moment of leparation arrived. Refiedling upon the distance they should be at from each other, and upon the uncertainty concerning the continuance of his affedtion, as they were at prefent circumstanced, she sighed, she wept. He Saw her distreSs, and could hardly, So loth was he to quit her, refrain from endeavouring to gain her permission to be near her, .wherever she went. He ventured to drop a few hints of that kind; but
she
Mr. WAL LACE. 191
she would not listen to them. He bore, however, the Separation with rnore reSolution than she did; thouo-h his love for her was rather increaSS, becauSe he was So entirely convinced of her firm attachment to him.
Eleonora was received by Lady RuSsly with an affedlion, mixed with a tender melancholy. So perfedlly Suitable to her then state of mind, that no other place, without the company of MonSon, could have been So agreeable to her.
While thele ladies were thus freely indulging their different Sorrows, Mrs. Wallace, not a little pleaSed with the absence of Eleonora, enjoyed the Society of her favourite MiSs Myers, without interruption; and as the ex-peded time of her lying-in drew near, she engaged Die to remain with her till she was up again; who, pleaSed with the removal of Mifs Wallace, accepted of the invitation with delight.
Her

Her company was not indeed at all agreeable to Wallace; but he restrained liimSelf from making any ob-jedioHS, or diScovering any disiike to it, becauSe his wife was in a particular Situation, and becauSe he w^as deeply indebted to her for his appearance in life. He could not possibly feel that passionate tenderneSs for Mrs. Wallace which he certainly would have felt for Fanny Lefiy, had it been in his power to have made her Sensible of his love ; but he was always affedionately obliging in his behaviour to her; nay, apparently fond of her, and So perfedly ifatisfied her by his behaviour, that it increased her fondneSs for him ; which fondneSs excited in him apprehensions for her Safety; apprehensions not without foundation ; for through a violent desire to be preSent at a new Opera, she occasioned the premature birth of a Son ; and the diforders with which his birth was attended, put an end to her life in a fortnight afterwards. The child, by proper care, throve extremely.

Wallace, who was poffeffed of more humanity and tendernefs than is to be met with, perhaps, in the majority of his Sex, was both shocked and asslidted at her unex-pedted and untimely fate: and tho* she was not lamented by him in the manner she would have been if he had choSen her for his wife, he was too much dejedted by her death, to stay in the place where she died. He, therefore. Set out for his father’s houSe. As he had lost Mrs. Wallace, he did not think himfelf obliged to follow bu-fineSs. While she lived, a generous wish to improve what she had bestowed on him, for the advantage of herfelf and her children, prompted him, in Spite of her perSua-fions and remonstrances, to attend cloSely to his profession. Having nothing now to excite his industry, and being diSgusted with all the objedts about him, change of place would, he thought, contribute more than any Yol. L	K	thing

thing elSe to the removal of his unea-linefs.
After having Spent about six weelcs at his native village, with his little Son, he left him there under the in-Ipedlion of his mother ; and returned, to town. He had not quite given up the law; but he did not make him^ Self a stave to it. Having been accustomed, however, to a domestic life, and sinding that his Solitary meals, and the unSocial manner in which he Spent his time, had, by renewing a train of melancholy thoughts, brought on a stight indisposition; he took the advice of the physician whom he always confulted when he was out of order, who prescribed very little besides change of air and exercife.
As he had kept up a constant correspondence with Eleonora, he received frequent letters from her. On being informed of his indisposition, ^	she
Mr. WALLACE. 1^5
she expressed a great desire to See him : perfedly ignorant of Lady Rufsiy’s former attachment to him, and unwilling to leave her, she did not imagine there was any impropriety in the invitation; and he (not Supposing that any partiality for him remained in her ladyship, after the lapfe of Ib many years) prepared to make her a visit.
y
MiSs Wallace, who sincerely loved her brother, flew to him with all the warmth of Sisterly af-fedlion.
Lady RuSsly, both from Surprize*' and from a joy which she probably thought should not be revealed, received him with stuttered Spirits, and down-cast eyes. The ressetstions, however, on the unlooked-for death of Maria, Soon threw them both into a dejeDed state, in which, had it not been for the assistance of Eleonora, K 2	they

i
“ None, I hope,” anSwered she, blushing, of which any one can rea-

Wallace replied, with a Smile, that he could trust to her discretion.
You may, indeed,” Said Lady RuSsly, colouring; “ she has a very “ large share of it, a much larger one ** than I could ever boast of in Such ** a fituatiou.’!

After
Mr. WALLACE. 197
After Some time had elapSed, when I^ady RuSsly had recovered from the Surprize which she felt at this unex-pedted visit, and expressed her plea-lure at it; and when she had Sympathized with him in lamenting the loSs of her sister, they inSensibly fell into an intimacy, which rendered them every hour more agreeable to each other; but that intimacy did not incite them to encroach upon the limits which were preScribed by consanguinity.
As Wallace had been the first, the only man whom Lady RuSsly had evp loved, she felt a pleaSure in his being continually near her, without feeing any other objed to attradl: his attention from her, beyond expression intoxicating; and as she more re-ferhbled Fanny Lessy, the only woman for whom his heart was ever in a palpitating condition, than any per-Son he had Seen, he was charmed with her agremens, without once re-fieding upon the conSequences. But
K. 3	though
19B The History of
though he felt many Symptoms of the tender passion, they were far leSs disquieting than thoSe which his beloved Fanny had inSpired, whom he more than ever longed to behold.
By almost imperceptible degrees, notwithstanding. Lady RuSsly and Mr. Wallace became almost inseparable companions ; they walked, they rode, they played, they Sung, they . read together ; and her amiable unaf-feDed IweetneSs and tenderneSs nearly conquered an heart which had never • yielded, from his friendship chiesiy for Sir Edward RuSsly, to her beau-■ ties before. She appeared So amiable in his eyes, that though he came to Oxfordshire to Spend only a fortnight, a month at farthest, he deferred his departure from time to time, till the SeaSon approached which calls most people to London; and to which there was a necessity for his Speedy return, if he intended not to quit his profession entirely. In vain did he rested upon that necessity; he could
not
Mr. WALLACE. 199
not prevail on himSelf to quit the agreeable Society which he enjoyed, to Spend the dull joyleSs hours in an houSe which would only revive ideas that he wished to bury in oblivion. In this wavering situation, the pressing - intreaties both of Lady I^ uSsly and his sister to continue where he was, had half determined him to comply with them; when Eleonora, who imagined that she perceived a reludlance in him, and believed that she had guessed the occasion of it, gave him a stint to return Lady RuSsly’s extreme po-liteneSs to him and to herSelf, by in-fisting upon her ladyship’s making uSe of his houSe for a winter’s residence.
Whether Eleonora was really impelled out of mere friendship for her brother and Lady RuSsly, to make this propoSal, or whether a distant hope of Seeing MonSon had not Some influence upon her, I shall not pretend to determine; but her motion
K 4	was
200 The HisTORy of \
was certainly not difagreeable to either of them.
After a little hesitation, and much perSuaSion, Lady RuSsIy conSented, for the pleaSure of being still near Eleonora, to return her visit at her brother’s ; and they accordingly all three came to town, where no material alteration was made in their style of living.
Wallace, indeed, devoted the greatest part of the morning to bust- ' neSs ; but the reft of the day was entirely dedicated to the amiable Lady RuSsly, who received very few visits which could give any interruption to Such desirable Society.
MonSon, who was Soon informed of their arrival, stew with rapture to Eleonora; but his preSence, far from being troubleSome to the others, as he was deeply engaged with the miS-treSs of his heart, only gave them
more
Mr. WALLACE. 201
more frequent opportunities to entertain each other.
Sometimes, however, Wallace and Lady RuSsly went together to the play, opera, and other public places of rational amulement; but they were generally better pleaSed to be at home. As they were both great admirers of reading and of music, the hours ssew Swiftly away ; and as the Ipring returned, Wallace, who was a true lover of the country, propoSed little excursions to the villa where he first became acquainted with the ami-able Cecilia.
The fight of a Spot once So dearly beloved, drew So many sighs from the gentle boSom of Cecilia, that Wallace, touched with her melancholy, strove to administer all the conSolation to her in his power.
When the mornings were fine, they strolled over the pleaSant gardens, which had been So elegantly laid out

by Mr, Brereton, and when she looked fatigued, he kindly offered his friendly arm to Support her. When she choSe to ride, he assisted her in mounting her shorSe, and was ever ready to take her down in his arms.
TheSe little marks of his tenderneSs often repeated, together with his anxiety about her health, and his assiduous endeavours to divert her gloomy thoughts, strengthened the impression which his engaging perfon, winning manners, and extensive understanding, had already made on her mind; nor did that understanding, which had So early enabled him to judge accurately concerning propriety in every thing, check his attentions to her; he deemed it in no way criminal to treat her with the rcSpedtful familiarity due to the Sister of his wife-, till she Saw her melted into tenderneSs by the alluring charms of his behaviour. Then, indeed, he began to resiecl Serioussy on the conSequences of Such a behaviour.

viour, and wished to make an alteration in it; but an alteration in it was not easily to be made, as he was really very much pleafedwith her company ; butas he found that it occasioned improper SenSations in the heart of Lady RuSsly, he reSolved to be more upon his guard. He, therefore, gradually changed his carriage to her ; but even before that change, she, who had felt herSelf but too Sensibly touched, determined to return to Oxfordshire, though'she had hot yet communicated her reSolves.
One night at the opera, while they were thus Situated, Wallace was struck with the appearance of a young lady, who exaftly reSembled MiSs Lessy ; but Mifs Lefiy grown into a woman, with not only a perSon infinitely improved, but with all the outward embellishments which could Set it off to the greatest advantage; her dreSs was elegantly rich, and there was a remarkable brilliancy in her jewels. The prodigious improbability
K 6
204 li^^ History ot
of her ever appearing in So Splendid a Situation, induced him at first to conclude that his eyes had mifinformed ' him; yet, not being able to remove them from a beautiful objeft So perfedlly refembling the idol of his heart, he indulged, his inclination by gazing freely at her while he was unobserved ; he gazed with eagerneSs, till she accidentally diredled her eyes towards him, and Surveyed him with a mixture of Surprize- and pleaSure. She continued to look at him like one who has just discovered a long lost friend, and as if she expedled him, indeed, to recognize her; but finding that he still looked earnestly at her, without Seeming to recolledl: her face, her natural modesty, added to her regret on not being remembered by Jhim, orimSoned her cheeks to Such a degree, that Wallace, thinking that he had been much too free with his glances, threw his eyes down, and ac-cuSed himfelf of having allowed them too much liberty; as he had diScon-certed So lovely a woman, who appeared
%
Mr. WALLACE. 205
peared to be possessed of as much delicacy as beauty. Yet her extreme likeneSs to the dear image which had never been forgotten by him, prompted him to renew his glances, and to alk Some gentlemen who fat near him, and who admired her no leSs than himSelf, if they could favour him with her name.
One of them replied, that she was
Lady Frances F-------only daughter
to Lord T--------.
This intelligence, of which he had no reaSon to doubt the authenticity, did not quite destroy his first hopes, that she might possibly be his Mils Lessy; though he could no way account for the magnificence of her appearance, but by an advantageous turn in point of fortune.
Certain, therefore, at last, that he had been deceived by the clofeneSs of the reSemblance, and not willing to encourage the flattering emotions of
his
*
\
2o6 The HisTORy of
his heart, he determined to look at her no more; but turned all his attention TO Lady RuSsly, which was Sufficient, from his natural politeneSs oS diSpoSi-tion, and tenderneSs for her Situation, to make people, who obServed them, believe that she was far- from being an indifferent objedl to him. She had alSo taken notice of Lady Frances ; and as she was, unlike the generality of women, very much inclined to admire beauties in her own Sex, and Spoke much in praiSe of her to Wallace ; her panegyrics, as he was particularly charmed with' her, delighted him extremely, and made him rather redouble than fiacken his assiduities about his very amiable sister-in-law.
Lady Frances, who had Scarce ever taken her eyes off them, ashed, in her turn, the name of that lovely young kdy ; and happening to ash a perfon who had heard much of the attachment between Mr. Wallace and Lady RuSsly, and who was one of thoSe
peo-

people rather diSpoSed to heighten than to leffen an idle report, deScribed their mutual affedlion in the strongest terms; and declared, that he thought they were perSedtly at liberty to indulge it, as the Sister of a wife was by no means an improper perSon to Succeed her; adding, that if the Commons should pretend to be impertinently troubleSome, Lady RuSs-ly’s large fortune enabled her Sufficiently to purchaSe the Satisfadlion of being united to a man So very agreeable, and So truly deServing. ^
Lady Frances was inexpressibly af-fedted by this information ; for tho’ she had no room to SuppoSe that she should ever meet Wallace Single, or unengaged; yet, as she had formed but too many wishes that he might be So, she felt Severely the disappointment ; striving, however, with all her addreSs, to conceal her feelings.

A digression here, relating to this lady, will not be, perhaps, unneceS-Sary. She was, indeed, the real Fanny Lessy, by which name she was called while she was ignorant of her own. As her father had married privately a lady with a very Small fortune, and feared the reSentment of his family, who had it in their power greatly to distreSs him, he left his little daughter under the care of Mr. and Mrs. Edwards, who were his particular friends, and desired that she might j paSs for their neice, when he went to make the tour of Europe, having first concerted measures for his lady’s following him.
He implicitly conformed to the di-redlions of his tutor, in the route; but when the time for their return to England approached, he contrived delays in order to retard his departure ; and theSe delays were So frequently repeated, that his family, wearied with expectation, and not in the least imagining that he had any legal attachment
Mr. WALLACE. 209
tachmcnt abroad, left him to follow his own inclination. He accordingly Settled at Geneva, where his lady was contented to paSs for his mistreSs, till he thought proper to own her, that is, till the death of his fatheti

Lady T>------, who died in a short
time after her daughter’s arrival. As they were both amiable, and both equally pleafed with each other, this Sudden Separation was equally regretted by them ; and it mixed a tender Sort of melancholy in the mind of Lady Frances, which her father’s most indulgent fondneSs could not remove.
After

After this heart-felt loSs, he moved about from place to place, hoping by new Scenes to dissipate his own grief, and entirely to revive his daughter’s natural chearfulneSs: but his travelling was not attended with all the happy effedts which he wished for.
In their Several routes, especially at Aix la Chapelle, Lady Frances charmed Some men of fashion, who were Serious in their designs, and with my lord’s approbation, paid their addresses to her; but the constant coldneSs which she discovered upon thoSe occasions, joined to the ressedlions which my lord could not help making on his own infelicity in having been forced into a clandestine marriage, through the austerity of his father, made him re-Solve not to compel Lady Frances to marry a man who was not agreeable to her; he was, on the contrary, determined to do every thing in his power to unite her to one for whom she had a particular prepossession,
and
Mr. WALLACE. 211
and therefore laid no restraint on her.
The remembrance of Wallace, ^ whom she had known from her infancy, still remained strong enough to exclude every other pretender; and when she Saw him So improved in perSon and addreSs, So formed with every grace to win and keep the coldest heart, ssie wished to be re-colledted by him. She went farther ; she wished to find him free from any engagement, and to renew the pleasing intercourse which had once made all the happineSs of her life.
As she was no stranger, while she lived at Mrs. Edwards’s, to his silial duty and affedlion, his tender regard for his Sister, his generosity of temper, and his indefatigable application to study, in order to shine in the profeffion for which he was designed ; and by following which aS-Siduoussy, he hoped to reward the

Upon her return to LtigLnd, however, the death of his wife, and his strong attachment to Lady RuSsly, were the almost first pieces of intelligence which she heard. She would have written to the MiSs Wallaces, her young companions, upon her leaving Mrs. Edwards’s ; but she knew not whither, nor to whom she was going, as the earl had reserved the Secret of her birth to be discovered by himSelf. Besides, she was Sent for in Such a hurry, that she had Scarce time to bid them adieu.
Still,
Mr. WALLACE. 213
Still, however, she intended to write, when she was fettled; but the affedt-ing interview with her parents, the illneSs of her mother, the loSs of her, with the death of Mrs. Edwards, and his removal to Bath, all combined to hinder her from beginning a correspondence which she had most Serioussy intended.

A cool politeneSs was all they could obtain for all the admiration With which they treated her So pro-fuSely ; and indeed there were Several wdrom the earl would have liked for relations; but being absolutely de-termhned to make his daughter happy, if possible, in her marriage, as he had been rendered otherwise in his- own, by thoSe who had the Same right to chuSe tor him, he left lady Frances to acl as fne thought proper, in a

point in which she was herlelf So much interested.
The grateful, the amiable daughter/ in return for Such uncommon tender-neSs, opened her whole heart to her indulgent father, and mentioned Wallace in terms which made the earl , conceive a very high opinion of him. But though she acknowledged her prepossessions in his favour ; she at the Same time frankly confessed that she Snould be miSerable even with him, if she was not affured that he married her entirely from choice, uninstu-enced by her fortune or her rank.

Now, there was not fo great a difference in the appearance of Eleonora : file w'as older than Lady Frances j in her perSon, therefore, little or no alteration was perceptible ; her dreSs was genteel, but not at all Iplendid.

Conversation, as well as thoSe of her perSon, and as he had only Seen the beauties of the latter in Lady Frances, he determined to entertain no thoughts about her; but to apply himSelf with fresh assiduity to his pro^ fdlion.' He was the more bent to carry this design into execution, as he had formed a plan to facilitate the happineSs of Eleonora; tho’ the generous conception of it, and the doubts which he harboured concerning the SucceSs of it, prompted him to bury it in the deepest recesses of his breast. Fie could not prevail on himSelf to communicate it even to Lady RuSsly, though In the true Spirit of friendship he repoSed the greatest confidence in her.
Yfhen he had thoroughly digested his plan, he went one morning to Sir Robert MonSon’s in his own carriage, and desired to have half an hour’s conversation with him.

The Servant who came to him, afked his name; but he replied, “ that as he v/as not known to Sir “ Robert, the mention of his name would be of no conSequence.”
The appearance, however, wdiicii he made in the eyes of the Servant, procured an admiffion to his master,, who treated him, on account of hsis figure and behaviour, with great politenefs, till he opened the buSi-nefs lie came about in the following, manner:
“ I am the brother of that MiSs ** Wallace, Sir Robert, whom your Son has long admired; and Site well deServes, I am happy to ffy, “ though she is my sister, all the ‘‘ esteem and affedion of So amiable a gentleman ; but as there is a great “ deficiency on her side, in point of “ fortune, I am willing to repair in Some meaSure, that deficiency, by paying down upon her marriage B 4	“ v/ith

It is not very eaSy to deScribe the astonishment which this haughty baronet felt at the delivery of So generous a propoSal, or the contempt with which he received it. He was like too many people of rank and fortune, exceedingly hurt to find that a man io far beneath him in birth, as he looked on Wallace to be, was So far iuperior to him in nobleneSs of Spirit and tenderneSs of affeftion. Hating him alSo for possessing virtues So infinitely above all the advantages which he was master of; and envying even while he strove to defpiSe him, he replied with exquisite diSdain, ‘‘ And do YOU imag;ine, fir, that the offer of “ your paltry ten thoufand pounds, can make me forget that you and “ your Sister are the offsprings of a “ North country doftor ? No, Mr. “ Wallace, added he,” with a contemptuous Sneer, as that is your name I think, '‘ be assured, I shall

At the conclusion of this Speech, the last words of which he uttered with uncommon energy, he turned his back upon the astonished baronet, and quitted the houfe diredtly.
Particular bnSineSs having kept him abroad the whole day, he had Seen none of his family ; he would not inr deed have mentioned what had passed between him and Sir Robert, if he had gone home diredly. Imagine,, therefore, his extreme Surprize, when upon his return, Eleonora and Mpnr-Son stew to him with open arms, while Lady RuSsly looked as if she was only prevented by the custom of the world from discovering her joy in the Same manner.
When MiSs Wallace had thanked her brother in terms Suitable to the occasion, for the unexpedled step which he had taken in her favour, MonSon claSped him to his boSom,. and Said, “ My dear, my generous
friend,, let me but add brother,

And do you really believe that “ Eleonora is So undeServing of So “ much felicity,"’ replied Wa!llace gravely, “ as to purchaSe it So mean-“ ly; to purchase it by coming into “ a family who deSpiSe her No, my “ dear MonSon, I shall never bring “ mySelf to conSent tosher being de-

I do not pretend to deny that I “ feel for him more than I ever felt for any man; but I would not lessen him So much in the eyes of his relations, as to become his “ wife without their entire approba-“ tion.”
MonSon, half distraded at Eleonora’s reSolute reply, made uSe of every argument which his ardent love for her Suggested to him; but to no pur-poSe^ The contempt with which her brother’s generous propoSal had been received by his father, with whoSe injurious behaviour, glowing wish re-Sentment against it, he had acquainted her, rendered her immoveable; for Sir Robert had absolutely declared to

his Son, when he informed him of Wallace’s visit, and of the cool re-^ ception which he gave him, that he would disinherit him if he persisted in making his.addresses to that lOw-born girl.
MonSon, finding that nothing was able to make Eleonora recede from the resolution which she had taken, became wretched to the greatest degree ; and complained of her unkind-heSs in stich pathetic terms to her, that in order to render him tolerably eaSy, she promiSed not to entertain any other lover while he was living, and unmarried, and still retained the fame Sentiments for her. She agreed alSo, with her brother’s conSent, to See him now and then among the rest of their acquaintance.
As this was her final anSwer, he was obliged to appear contented with it, lest he should be altogether re-jeclied; but though he promiSed to make leSs frequent visits to her at her
brother’s,
i6 The History of
brother’s, this compliance was but of a short duration; for he Soon made his appearance there as often as ever. Eleonora was Sometimes angry, but never violently So, and her anger was only momentary.
Lady RuSsly, who had by this-time brought herSelf to think Seri-oussy of returning home, mentioned her design one evening to Wallace as they were Sitting alone, Eleonora being in her own apartment, writing to her mother.
He started at the thoughts of parting with her, though he was convinced of the propriety of her departure ; but the intelligence came upon him So Suddenly, and was So unwelcome to his ears, that he sighed before he was aware, and Said, “ How melan-“ choly will be my hours whem “ I am deprived of your agreeable ** company!”
« If

Mr. W AL L A C E. 37 “ If it is really agreeable to you,
« Mr. Wallace,” Said she, with ^ tenderneSs in her voice which she * could not stifle, “ there is an abSo-“ lute neceshty for my immediate de-parture.”
“ There is, I fear, indeed, my lady,” replied he, rising, and walking from her, to hide his emotions, wshch he could not otherwise conceal; but the transport which fly felt at finding herSelf really necessary to the happineSs of a man whom she had long loved in vain, vras So great, that she could not, in Spite of all hy discretion, refrain from exclaiming, “ Then I shall at last be happy, “ since I am esteemed by Mr. “ Wallace, and since my departure “ will be regretted by him.”
"	“ Good Heaven !” cried Wallace,
wholly Softened,' “ Could Lady “ RuSsly possibly imagme that my “ heart was not filled with the most affe<ftiojiate, the most tender eS-

“ Stop, stop, there,” cried she, with her eyes drowned in tears: There is now an eternal bar between us ; but if you ever wiSned, if you ever once wished, Wallace, “ that it could be removed, I am overpaid for all my Sufferings on your account.’*
“ Have you then Suffered for me, “ _my dear Lady RnSsly ?” cried he, going up to her, as she Sat overwhelmed with a tender confusion. Had I known it before it was too late! But my friend’s passion “ for you; the choice which your “ father made of your Sister for me;

Fearing, however, that he should move her too much, and not

being able himSelf to endure So Softening a Scene, he turned from her with emotions which he had never felt before, and covered his face with bis handkerchief.
They both remained for Some time over-powered with the different Sen-fations which oppressed them. Lady RuSsly then, first recovering, roSe, and endeavouring to recal her Scattered Spirits, Said, “ Let us, Mr. “ Wallace, strive to think no more of “ what ought to be for ever buried, in oblivion. I am iinexpedledly happy in finding that I am So truly ‘‘ esteemed by you ; but I must, you “ know, merit your esteem,” continued she, by perSevering in the re-“ Solution which I have taken to “ leave you to-morrow.

Mr. WALLACE. 23
. Upon Eleonora’s entrance into the room, he diredlly told her that Lady RuSsly being refolved to go into Ox-^ fordshire the next day, he had promised in her name, that she should accompany her.
MiSs Wallace, though she would probably, for Some reaSons, have choSen to remain with her brother, was yet too fond both of him and of Lady RuSsly to refule them what they desired.	i
Lady RuSsly, though she had long intended to leave Wallace, intended not to have left him So absolutely; but after that evening’s interview no delay was to be made. She, therefore, with uncommon discretion, haf-tened every thing for her departure early in the morning. When she wished him a good night, she added, with a sigh, “ It will be better for us, Mr. Wallace, to Spare each other the paimof taking leave; do not, therefore, let my rising early,

disturb you. I will acquaint you with my arrival at Woodby; and you will, I hope, inform me of your health in town.”
She then roSe in order to retire to her apartment; shut stopped at the door, and looking back Said, May all happineSs attend you! ” “ May “ every blessing follow my dearest Sister’s v/ish !” replied Wallace.
Eleonora then bade him adieu! while Lady RuSsly, not daring to trust herSelf a moment longer with him, hurried up stairs, where, throwing herSelf into a chair, a shower of tears relieved her full heart.
MiSs Wallace, Surprized at this unuSual Sorrow, Said, “ Why, my “ dear friend, do you leave my “ brother, if the removal from him makes you So uneaSy V
“ Oh Eleonora I” replied my Lady, ‘‘ Have I been So very prudent
“ that
Mr. WAL L A C E. 25
that you have not found out the V necessity of it."'*
She then related to her ail the Sen-stations which had passed in her mind, from her first acquaintance with Wallace, to their last conversation. Eleonora admired her fortitude, while’ she pitied her disappointment.
When they were to Set out, Wallace, though desired not to riSe, could not, as he had passed a very sscepleSs night, hinder himSelf from taking a look at her from the window. Sic compassionated her diSquietude too much to increaSe it by a formal fare-wel. But as he was not visible, she concluded that he was not stirring, and lost the pleaSure which his last attention would have given her; tho' her distreSs would have been rendered more poignant by it.
As Soon as they were gone, Mon-fon, coming as uSual, was shocked at the unexpected intelligence which he
VoL. II. C	received;
2$ The IIisTORy of
received; but as the SeaSon approached when people of fashion leave the ^ town, he determined to paSs the fumimer near, if not with, his Eleonora.
After the departure of Lady Rulsly, Wallace endeavoured to a-muSe his thoughts in his hours of leisure, by mixing Sometimes among the gay crowd at the public entertainments, at which he frequently Saw the lovely Lady Frances; but as the sight of her always filled him with disquieting emotions, he as constantly endeavoured to avoid her, and rather in So abrupt a manner, that she, •ever watchful of, his behaviour was shocked at it. She had heard, from her informant, that Lady RuSsiy was gone to reSide in Oxfordshire, and that Wallace had no other attachment. What then could make him fo re-gardleSs of her. So apparently determined to avoid her, but an entire diS-' gtistj a Settled aversion ?
As
Mr. WALL ACE.
As she was certain that she had never Seen him unobServedby him, though he from the first appeared quite indifferent to her ; this negledl, from the only man in the world for whom* she ever felt a fond inclination, piqued her pride, and touched at the Same time a tender paffion. It affedted her, indeed, in Such a manner that she became melancholy, and diSgusted with every thing in a little,wliile. The xineaSmeSs of her mind difordered her body ; a languor feized her whole frame ; she lost all her chearfulnefs ; and began to decline going to public places when she could decently avoid them: and as she was thoroughly vexed with herSelf foi' still liking the only man breathing, who feemed to shun her, she confined her griefs entirely to her own breast ; fearing even to trust her father with the caule of the alteration in her, wshich he could not but perceive, lest he might take Some meaSures with regard to Wal-C 2	lace.
The HisTORy of
^ce, which would lessen her still more in her own eyes.
While Lady Frances was thus wretched about a man who Secretly admired her, he was not much more happy. Deprived of all the Social comforts of domestic life, and meeting with few of his own Sex who were as Serioufiy diSpoSed as himSelf, he had nothing to do but apply with more diligence than ever to the law.
While he was employed in this manner, a -first cousin of his, of the fame name, only dignified with the title of baronet, arrived from abroad, where he had been above three years for improvement. He had a very agreeable perSon; it could not indeed be deemed otherwiSe; for he was as like Wallace as two people could poS-fibly reSemble each other; and many mistakes had been occasioned by the Similitude between them before he left England. He was alSo young, sively. Sensible, and polite; and totally
Mr. WALLACE. 29
tally free from the vices by which young men of fashion and fortune, are too often distinguished. As he had always had a great esteem for . Wallace, he Sincerely rejoiced at his fucceSs in liSe, and Wallace was no leSs pleaSed at his return, that he might renew his friendship with him.
,\
Just before his cousin’s arrival, Wallace received letters both from Lady LuSsly and Eleonora, and anSwered them. He, therefore, dedicated all his leisure hours to Sir George, who could not, at that time, make any long stay in town, having promiSed to nieet ar gentleman in Northamptonshire, with whom he had conlTaCted an intimacy while he was in Italy.
After having Spent about a fortnight whth Wallace, Sir George Set out on his English tour.
Within ten miles of his friend’s ef-tate, in a green lane, he came up to C 3	a lady

Sir George hastily dismounting,, lent his assistance, at first:, merely from humanity; but v/hen by coming nearer he Saw the Sv/eet face and delicate form of her whom he Supported, he became immediately interested in her recovery.
As there was no carriage to be procured, and as the Servant Said that his lady was far from home. Sir George, assisted by the two men, carried her to a farm-houSe at a little distance, in v/li!ch she w^as laid on a couch,
, while his man wts dispatched with all possible expedition to the next town for a Surgeon; during whoSe abSence the mistreSs of the farm applied Several remedies to bring her to her SenSes ; Sir George doing every thing in his power to be Serviceable upost the QccaSiop, and expreffing tho:

“ My Lady, Sir, is a v/idow,” replied the fellow :	My master has
“ been dead about a year.
“ She is a lovely one,” Said Sir George.	^
Just as he had pronounced thoSe. words, she opened her eyes, and having stared wildly round her, for a few moments, fixed them at last earnestly on him, as he v/as kneeling by the fide of the couch, and Said, with a faint voice, Oh ! I remember that “ my horSe threw me; but how ■ came you here, Wallace Was ‘‘ you destined to Save my life a Se-

32 The History of
No words can deScribe Sir George’s-afconishment at this addreSs. He was certain that he had never Seen an human figure before, half So full of beausties; nor did he, notwithstanding his penchant., recollect that he had* ever been fortunate enough to Save the life of any lady. He Scarce knew, therefore, what reply to make. His Spirits were little leSs stuttered than the lady’s, who in confuSed and broken Sentences expressed her obligations to him ; still called him Wallace ; and poured out her gratitude-and esteem, not without wondering that he of all men should be fo providentially instrumental to^ her preservation.
Sir George, who vrould have been transported to have been the real per-Son for whom Such warm expressions were designed, began to believe tlrnt she was under a mistake, and that she certainly imagined him to be nis cousin, recollefling the reSemblance between them ; bur at the fame time,
reiblV'-
Mr. WALLACE.
refolving to humour the deception, he declared how exquisitely happy he was to be near her when she was in distressful a condition, and how delighted he was to think that he had: been of any Service to her; hoping.^ that she was not much hurt, and begging her to let him know if he could' do any thing farther towards her relief.
“ Nothing,” replied she, “ on-ly let me be carried home,, “ where. I shall sind. your Sister, my dear Eleonora, who will be as “ Sorry for my accident as you; “ are.’"
This anSwer confirmed all his coir— jedtures about his. cousin, and convinced him that her fright, and the pain she probably felt, prevented her • from attending very cloSely to, the; perfonal difference' between: them:*. Their voices, alfo, happened not to^ be easily distinguished. He still,, therefore, continued to talk with a, C 5,	more;

more tender kind of freedom, tham he would have ventured to do So Sooa with an entire stranger, had he been more charmed than he adiually was. But all his little assiduities about her, were accompanied with So much re-' Spe6l, that if she had not been at first mistaken, she could not well have been offended. She was, however, in a short time, undeceived ; for as Soon as she came a little to her-Self, she desired the woman of the houSe to assist her in rising from the, couch, that she might try to walk.
Sir George, then, gently raising her in his arms. Set her on her feet. A cloSer view of him, and a point of light in which she had not Seen him before, discovered her error. Striving to disengage herSelf from him,. ( while she blushed extremely for what she had been, though very innocently, Saying to a stranger, she cried out at the Same time, I beg your

‘‘ My name is George Wallace,.

She only could sigh a reply, thro*' weakneSs, and through disappointment. The effort to riSe, had convinced her that she was still unable: to move. She Sunk dovrn again upon the couch, and pointing to her head, which had received an ugly/ v blow. Said, I cannot talk now,, sir;-but I wish to See MiSs Wallace, who> y is at Wood by ,”

her, to desire MiSs Wallace to coni®* to her with all possible haste; adding;, “ Tell her, that Sir George Wallace,,. “ lately arrived from Italy, will be^

Lady RuSsly faintly lifted up her eyes, and diredted them to Sir George, upon his ceasing to Speak,,, as she just then recolledled that, she had heard Wallace mention Such a relation, who was making the tour of Europe, and attempted to afkhim Some questions; but he, perceiving that it would hurt, her to talk, intreated her to be quiet and sitting down by her side, gave her a very Succindt account of himSelf; which, he concluded with beggings that she would Suffer him to endea.-vour to gain a share of that friendship * which she felt for the rest of his family. She was too ill to Say much in return. She did not agree to his staying by her, and assisting her; nor did she discourage his stay or his assistance.

At this jundlure the Surgeon arrived, v:ho discovered a flight con^-tuSion in her head, which would not: permit her to be removed, as stillneSs and tranquility were neceffaryr for the promotion of her recovery. Wheiif he had finiflied the requisite applica-r tions, he desired the mistreSs of the' houSe, therefore, to get a bed prer pared for the lady; and proceeded to buSineSs ; wshile. Sir George Sup-f ported her in his arms with all the tendernefs and anxiety of a man who had long known, and long esteemed her;; making uSe of every argument, he could think of to keep up, her Spirits, , and to enforce the necessity of her fubmitting to a little preSent im~ eaSineSs, in order to Secure her, from a.. future one.
When the applications to her head were over, and when the Surgeon had affured .Sir George that the lady was in no danger, if she was kept quiet, and followed his direftions; Eleonora arrived, and was filled with the greatest
Sorrow
The HiSTORy of
Sorrow at her friend’s accident, and with* inexpressible Surprize at the sight of Sir George; declaring hov/ much she was astonished at not having been informed by her brother that he was in England ; but upon Sir George’s aS-fuiing her that he had promiSed to give her Such information when he left him, and that most likely there was then a letter upon the road to her for that purpoSe; and upon his desiring her to bestow all her atten^^ ticn upon her friend, who extremely wanted it, she assisted him in helping her up stairs. He then took his leave, begging her to come down-as Soon as Lady RuSsly could Spare her.
When Lady RuSsly was rendered as eaSy as a woman could possibly be in her situation, Eleonora returned to Sir George, whom she found bursting withimpatience to be informed of every thing relating to her companion ; and ■would Scarce give her time to afk the questions which she deemed but absolutely

lutely necessary, after So long an ab-fence; So eager was he to hear every circumstance concerning Lady RuSsly.
When Eleonora had finished her tale, which was short, for she mentioned nothing about her ladyship’s inclination for her brother, he cried out, What a lovely creature ! I “ never Saw an objed; So perfedtly amiable. Oh! my dearest cuz,, could I but make an impreshon “ on Such an heart!—Do you think it impossible f But I have a “ thouSand fears : yet methinks, while: “ she took me for your brother, she appeared So kind, So grateful—^ ' “ Oh I MiSs Wallace, there is Such a ‘‘ tumult in my boSom, do, for pity’s fake, do assist me in' gaining So angelic a being.

MiSs Wallace immediately went up to her friend ; and while she Sat in her room, wrote every particular that she could learn about her accident, and the unexpedled meeting with Sir George, and his violent passion for her,, to hershrother, as Lady RuSsly was not

When evening approached, Eleonora found that Sir George had procured a lodging for himSelf in a little village about half a mile from the farm, at which he left the ladies ; but returned early the next morning to enquire after Lady RuSsly’s health; and with great pleaSure heard that file was better than she could have been expedled to be. In a few days she began to sit up, and was pronounced by her Surgeon in a fair way of doing well; but he adviSed that she should not be carried home too Soon, lest the motion of a carriage for Several miles might fatigue her too much.
However, as Soon as Sir George heard that she had quitted her bed, he So earnestly intreated. to; See her, that at the deSire of Eleonora,, who had told Lady RuSsly how nearly he and, her brotlier were related, fire con--

This anfwer increafed her ladyship’s confusion, and confequently heightened the colour which started into her face upon Sir George’s entrance, making it appear more beautiful.
He approached her with a kind of timiclity, as if he was awe-struck at her preSence, and fearfulof diSpleaf-

She endeavoured to make a little apology for the mistake which she had committed ; and Said, that the true esteemffne had for Mr. Wal-“ lace, on account of his merit and his “ relationship to her, had made herper-“ haps, by discovering it in an impro-“ per manner, appear in an odd light;

Sir George, transported at this pp~ liteneSs, in which he could not be-mistaken, as it was diredled to him alone, expressed the utmost content-men.t at his reception, and begged her
to.*
44 The Historv of
to believe that he should think himSeir the happiest of men, when she was perfedtly recovered, and would permit, him to endeavour to deServe the regard with which she had honoured the rest oS his family.
She only replied with a modest boy, as she Sat in her chair • but from that time, whenever he desired to See her, and to See her he wished as often as decency would favour his admission, he was admitted.
Frequent interviews, and the gentle ^ resignation with which Lady RuSsIy bore the uneaSineSs which her accident must have necessarily occasioned, quite transported him. He never Saw her but with rapture; he never left her but with regret. By every polite and obliging endeavour to pleaSe, to amuSe her, he tried to lessen the irkSomeneSs-of her confinement: he Sent to London for every new and entertaining publication in the literary and musical way; and read to her.whenever
she.-
Mr. WALLACE. 4^5
she was diSpoSed to listen to him. Thofe orders to the metropolis were always accompanied with letters to Wallace, wherein he informed him how, beyond expression, he was charmed with Lady RuSsly : telling him, that the happineSs of his future life depended upon his pleasing her; and intreating him to mention him v/hen he wrote to her, in the most favourable terms.
Wallace was at first exceedingly grieved at the hurt which Lady Rulsly had received; but when he found that she was out of danger, and that Sir George was fo much enamoured with her, fo well received by her too, as a man who had rendered himfelf fer-viceable to her, he began to think that nothing would be more fortunate for her, than to view him in an agreeable light. Unhappy as she had been in her first marriage, and still prepoffeffed in favour of him whom site could not marry with prudence, no man was, in
his
■46	, The HI s T o R y of
his opinion, more likely to make her happy in the marriage state than he who So nearly reSembled him, who was paffionately fond of her, who had a general good charadter, and who was extremely good-natured. When he, wrote, therefore, to congratulate her on her recovery, he mingled fome encomiums upon Sir George with his gratulations ; and strongly hinted that an alliance between them would be ■ both prudent and desirable, if her compliance with Such a propoSal was Solli-cited. This hint being alSo communicated at the Same time to Sir George, paved the way for him to mention what he longed, but dreaded, to pro-poSe. He waited, however, diScreetly till he was thoroughly well received as the relation of Wallace and Eleonora, and with all the eafy freedom allovT-d by friendship ; fuch a reception his likeneSs to Wallace the assistance which he had given her, and his reSpedtful assiduity, foon procured.

Lady RuSsly, at her return home, could not well refrain from inviting Sir George to Woodby on Eleonora’s account, at which place MonSon alSo, who had wrote constantly to his friend inXondon, was a frequent visiter, having hired a Small houle for the Summer at a little distance, on purpoSe to be near MiSs Wallace; who, tho’she would not make any promiSes in his favour, could not bring herSelf to drive him to absolute delpair, by forbidding him . t?o See her.

As theSe two lovers were very much engaged with each other. Sir George was unavoidably left much alone with Lady RuSsly; and had, therefore, a thouSand opportunities to obServe the SweetneSs of her disposition, and the extreme amiableneSs of her manners; which increased his passion for her to Such a degree, that he could Scarce , keep it within bounds ; but the fear of being banished from her sight, if his propofal should not prove acceptable to her, prevented him from

He had, indeed, made fb gradual, So imperceptible a progreSs in ner affections, that she was nor aware of it; and, therefore, altogether unprepared to oppoSe it with the fiightest resistance. Sometimes, preSuming upon the excessive complaiSance with which she treated him, and on the many hours which she devoted to him, he fiattered himSelf that she was not totally averSe to him ; but the dread of

One day, after much hesitation, he, with a faultering voice and imploring eyes, and with a tremor which shook his whole frame, ventured to Speak : he Spoke, and was rejeded. But re> jeded as he was, he had the happineSs to find, that she did not Seem to wish for his abSenCe; for she told him, “ that after the assistance which he ‘‘ had afforded her, she should always “ look upon him as a friend, and as nearly related to Mr. and Mils Wallace.’*
He bowed; but made no replyf He had not much reaSon to expect a more favourable anSwer from her; but he was, nevertheless, hurt by her refuSal.

50 The HiSTGRy of
After the lapSe of two or three days, during which he came to Woodby in his iiSual way, as he found that he was not ill received, he ventured to intreat her to let him still See her as a friend, to let him still endeavour to pleaSe her p hoping that in time he might be happy enough to make an impression upon ah heart So very much to be desired.
She blushed, and Said, that she should be always glad to See him as a friend; and then left him abruptly, as if she chofe to diScourage all farther application.
Sir George wrote immediately to Wallace, informed him of all that had passed, and urged him more strongly than ever to plead for him ; he alSo applied to Eleonora, and in So Serious, So earnest a manner, that she very Sincerely promiSed to do her utmost to perSuade Lady RuSsly to accept of him.
,	Eleonora
Mr. WALLACE. 51
Eleonora kept her word; but could not prevail on her ladyship to receive his addresses, nor even, for a considerable time, to give her reaSons for refusing a man So every way agreeable.
She communicated her ill fiiccefs to Sir George, upon his begging to be pld the truth; but knowing that her intelligence would be diSagreeable, Softened it. He would not, however, let her be quiet till she had delivered Lady RuSsly’s adlual anSvrer, and mentioned her very great reServe upon the occasion.
This communication, which he extorted from her by the repeated earnestneSs of his intreaties, made him excessively uneafy. He never had before loved any vroman ; the conth 11 Lied politeneSs, therefore, of Lady RuSsly, even after having refuSed him on the tenderestoccaSion,furpriSed him gready : but it alSo shocked him ; he fancied, by the coolneSs of her behaviour, that he was now absolutely her H 2	averSun,
52 The Historv of
aversion, or So very indifferent to her, that she was not in the least afraid to ■ti'ust herSelf with him ; for she never avoided private interviews with him, when Eleonora was otherwiSe engaged.
The vexation which this mortifying politeneSs in Lady RuSsly’s carriage occasioned, affedled him in Such a manner, that it impaired his health : it produced a striking change in his looks. The fresh bloom of maSculine beauty no longer animated his countenance ; it had a pale, languid appearance ; his appetite gradually declined; and he lost his Spirits. This change in himSelf he strove to conceal from her; but his altered looks Spoke in •very intelligible language.
MiSs Wallace, wlio was truly ^ his friend, Saw and pitied his Situation. His obliging behaviour to her, the reSemblance between him and her brother, whom she So dearly loved, too-ether with the anxiety which she
herSelf
Mr. WALLACE. herSelf Suffered on Monfon’s account, railed in lier breast a kind of concern for him; and she was pained to See him So miserable, tho’ she strove to hide her anxiety about him,and still endeavoured to be Serviceable to him; besides, from a regard forl^ady RuSsly. who had not yet, she vrell knew, been happy, and who, she nov/ thought, had a fair opportunity to be So with a man, to whom, notwithstanding her behaviour to him, she had, in her opinion, no diilike; she determined to be his advocate. She therefore, one day, as they were sitting alone together, introduced a conver-' Sation on happinels ; and very freely declared, that two people every way Suitable, with a tender esteem for each other, inseparably united, stood, she believed, the beSi chance to obtain it.
When Eleonora found that her friend without any hesitation Subscribed to her opinion, she then added, “ And why,my dear LadyRuSsly, do you sit “ still, and refuSe a man who is general-‘‘ ly allowed to have every requisite to pleaSe ^ a man whom you must think O 3	“ more

more agreeable than any other, from “ your prepoffeffion in my brother’s “ favour.” LadyRuSsly blushed at this home question, for v/hich she was quite unprepared; but, after a moment’s pauSe, laid, ‘‘ He is not your brother, “ Eleonora.”
Very true, replied MiSs, Wallace ; “ but he is as agreeable, nay, rather ‘‘ more So, I should imagine, as my “ brother never behaved to you with “ the tendernefs of Sir George ; and since you cannot have the former, why should you still rejedt the latter, “ with whom you might enjoy the ‘‘ most perfedl telicity How can you bear to.

Mr. WALLACE. 55
Lady RuSsly coloured like Scarlet, at the conclusion of this Speech; and, with her eyes thrown to the ground, replied, “ Does Sir George, “ then, wish to leave Woodby
I don’t know, indeed,” anSwered MiSs Wallace; but he certainly “ would be happier, if he was not “ here, unlefs you were diSpoSed to “ treat him more favourably.”

56 The HiSTORy of
“ Why then, my dear, cannot yotr “ bring yourSeif to love and to marry “ him
“ BecauSe, Eleonora, I do not like to marry any man. I could ne-“ ver prevail on mySelf to love Sir “ Edward RuSsly, as he ought to have been loved. No man was ever more deServing ; he left every “ thing to me; and Snail I, So early “ too, think of enjoying in this “ very houSe, in which he passed So “ many unhappy hours, a felicity “ with another which I could not “ give to him
«« Why not,” Said Eleonora ? ^‘Yoii “ did all that was in your power to “ pleaSe him ; you could do no more ; “ and he was,undoubtedly, thoroughly “ Satisfied v/ith you, by leaving every “ thing to you, that you might have “ an opportunity to pleaSe yourSelf. “ But,” continued she. Seeing her ladyship look Serious, “ if you, cannot, or even if you do not, think it right.
“ to.
Mr. WALLACE. 57
“ to encourage the addresses of Sir “ George, diSniiSs him •, let him go ‘V in Search of that peace Somewhere elSe, which you will not allow him to enjoy here.”
Lady RuSsly made no reply to this last piece of advice given by Eleonora, who left her in order to inform Sir George of the conversation which had just passed about him, and to perSuade him to leave Woodby for Some time. “ A short abSence,” continued she, “ would, I dare Say, be attendedwith desirableconSequences; Sor she has owned that she likes your “ company. And. I firmly believe that she has Said the truth.. If you “ can once bring her to pity you, your busineSs will be, in my opinion, more than half done ; you may be ‘‘ then pretty eaSy.,”
But I shall not be even eaSy,” replied he, “ ardently as I wish to call her mine, upon the terms on “ which Sir Edward Rufsly possessed her ; I must gain her heart, as well D 5	‘‘ as
,r;g The HisTORy of
“ as her perSon, or I can never br \ happy.”
‘‘ Andl have great reaSon tothink,”' Said MiSs Wallace, “ that you have “ more interest in her heart than you “ imagine.”
Sir George sincerely thanked Eleonora for the pains which she had taken to Serve him, but was too much in love to See with her eyes ; however, his . anxiety grew too poignant to be much longer endured with patience ; and he determined, as he found that his endeavours to touch Lady RtiSsly’s heart; were ineffedtual, to leave Oxfordshire, and to try what abSence would do for him.
He made the experiment at first, by staying away two or three days; but not having enjoyed any eaSe during his retreat, he returned to Woodby, Secretly reSolving to quit England, and to-go back to Italy, wishing to forget that he had ever left it^
During
Mr. WALLACE. 59
During the few days of Sir George’s absence from Woodby, Lady RuSsly received a very kind and Sensible letter from Wallace, in which he warmly perSuaded her to accept of Sir George, if she felt the Smallest inclination for him, and approved of his condudt. She was re-perusing this letter when he returned, and accosted her in the garden.
As he came with an intention to take his leave of her, he advanced towards her with an aSpedt unuSually melancholy. She was struck at the mourn-fulneSs of his appearance, and aSked him if he was not well.
“ So far, my lady,” Said he, am I “ from being well, that I have Some “ thoughts of returning to Italy for
the restoration of my health.”
She changed colour at this reply; it Surprised her, and she was hurt by it. “ Must Italy be the place,” laid she, with a plaintive voice, “ fixed

I am afraid not,, madam,” Said he.
“ I am Sorry to hear you Say So, Sir George,” replied she, with a visible concern in her air; and after a little hesitation, “ I shall be grieved,” continued she, with a gentle sigh, “ to part with So agreeable a friend.”
She stopped here, and threw her eyes on the ground ; while Sir George, who watched every variation of her features. Said, but with much anxiety, “ Do you then wish me to stay. Lady “ RuSsly ? If you do, you shall be “ obeyed, tho’ I pine away my life “ in fruitless expectation. But what is life} I can with pleaSure Sacrifice “ it to make you happy.
“ Gracious Heaven 1” cried Lady RuSsly, lifting up her tearful eyes,
“ can
Mr. WALL A C E. sir
can you believe me So inhum.an as to be plealed with the death of any man; with yours, of all men ?”
‘‘ And why this exception in my « favour ?” Said he, taking hold cf her hand,, and looking tenderly at her;
“ Why this amiable Sorrow ?
“ BecauSe you will not believe,’’" Said she, “ that I wish you to be well and happy.”
As it is in your power alone,” replied he, to make me So, jour “ wishes may be this moment gratified.
Why then will you delay to pro-“ nounce my felicity ? and why will you not give yourSelf to me for ‘‘ ever r” continued he, urging her with all the eloquence he was maS-ter of, till, overpowered by his per-fuaSions, and more affedled by Something which pleaded strongly for him in her boSom, she gave him her hand. He pressed it ardently to his lips; he threw his arm round

her ;' and, pulling her gently to him:, she let her face fall on his breast, on which she hid her blushes.
When she had a little recovered herSelf, she propoSed their returning towards the houSe; and he, ever ready to oblige her, wrapped her arm in his, and condudled her to sit. Upon her arrival, she ran to Eleonora; while he informed MonSon of his approaching happineSs.
Sir George, it may be SuppoSed,was very much delighted with this change in his favour. He behaved, indeed, for a few days, with all the raptures of a man intoxicated with his happineSs ; nor did Lady RuSsly Seem to be leSs transported, tho’ her extreme delicacy prevented her from giving a looSe to the joy of her heart. Sir George, being naturally of a very warm ' constitution, with difficulty curbed his joyous fenSations; but, as he both re-fpefted and esteemed Lady RuSsly to a very great degree, he kept them within the bounds of decorum. When
her
Mr. WALLACE. 65
her good-nature, however, and the progreSs which he really had made in her affeftions, prompted her to-sinile at his flights of passion, and Sallies of Satisfadtion, he could hardly check his vivacities ; and nothing but the fear of incurring her diSpleaSure,, prevented him from catching her frequently in his arms, and almost devouring her with kisses.
He one day threw himSelf by her fide, as she Sat upon a piece of turf, a little raiSed from the ground. While his eyes, glowing with love, v/ere fixed upon her face, he held one of her hands in his, and pressed her to reply to all his fond protestations ; to tell him how long she had loved him, and why she kept him in Such a cruel SuSpence ; why she almost killed him, by letting him remain So long upon the rack of uncertainty.

He obeyed her with alacrity, and-she, with the greatest truth and exadh-* neSs, began to relate every thing that had passed in her mind, after her first acquaintance with Wallace; the impression which he very early mads on her, and the reludtance with which she consented to become Lady RuSsly: she alSo told him how many fi’uitlds endeavours she had uSed to. return Sir Edward’s affedlion, and what a conquest she had gained over herlelf by quitting. Wallace, when she was convinced that he could have been happy withher. ShethenpauSedawhile, without having obServed the alterationwhich this discovery of her love for his cou--sin had occasioned in Sir George, and with which he had, till that instant, been entirely unacquainted; and thus went on : “ I Spent my days and hours

She stopped here, and, doubtleSs, expected a very ecstatic anSv/er, not without reaSon, from a man of Sir George’s turn, who had been almost dying for her; but the very unexpeCtr ed^ discovery of his being loved,, chiefly, and indeed in his opinion wholly, for being like his cousin,., added to the affectionate esteem which, she strongly expreffed for that cousin,. Shocked him So prodigioufly, that all his fortitude was necessary to prevent her from observing, the emotions, with which shC had disturbed his, breast. The unhappy fate of Sir Edward RuSsly redoubled his diSqui-etude, and he Soon grew aSfured, that, compassion, not love, had produced her compliance with his deSires ; and that his cousin would always be the favourite of her heart. He could not,, however, make an handSome retreat,
and
Mr. WALLACE. 67
and refiiSe to accept of a favour which he had with So much ardor Solicited; nor could he but be unhappy, while he was fully convinced, from appearances, that he was not the objedt of Lady RuSsly’s love.
Struck with a Sort of horror at his. situation, he let her hand drop from his, and made no anSwer to v:hat the charming openneSs of her temper had obliged her to declare to him. He-Said nothing : he only Sighed. .
Astonished at So strange a behaviour, tho’ totally unable to conceive the cauSe of it, she became immediately’ alarmed, and cried, “ What’s the mat-“ ter. Sir George ; are you not well ’
“ Not well at all, my Lady,” replied he, faintly, glad to conceal the disorder of his mind, by encouraging; her to SuppoSe that ill health had occasioned the alteration in him.

His Sudden indiipoSition, and the" coolneSs of his reply, shrpriSed her; for though he had treated her with all possible reSpea before company, yet, when they were by them-' lelves, after her having confented to-be his, he had laid aside all that formality, and indulging the violence of ms passion, had frequently called her his dearest, loveliest Cecilia, his charming angel, &c. &c. She, therefore, concluded that he was very much disordered, and pressed him to go in, little dreaming that the most raging jealouSy had taken possession of him . which he knew not how to cure' hardly to conceal,	’
He walked about, when she was not preSent, with folded arms, discontented and wretched. When she was With him,^ and from the, concern which she felt for his want of health, dilcovered unuSual tendernefs in her behaviour to him, he strove to return It; nay, fometimes with fuch irresistible naivete did she express her affection

tlonfor him,that,inSpiteof his tormenting Suspicions, he could not withstand the magic of her manners.; but gave himfelf up to the flattery of being apparently beloved. At thoSe times he claSped her to his boSom with the raptures of a man quite delirious with joy; but his raptures were momen-taneous ; he Soon flung her from him with looks of the most frigid indifference ; and if she aSked why he behaved with So much cruelty, either declared his doubts concerning the reality of her affedion for him, or imputed the irregularity of his carriage to the fluduation of his Spirits.
Continued complaints of illneSs, as she accuSed herSelf of having laid the foundation of them, disturbed Lady RuSsly, at length, exceedingly. She became restleSs and unquiet, and, by a thoufand marks of fond attention, endeavoured to repair the miS-chief which she had innocently occasioned; but Sir George, still prepof-fesscd with a belief that site loved no
man
I
yo	The HiSTORy of
man exceptWalldce, and that she con-■Sidered him only as another Sir Edward, grew absolutely half diS-traded.
The unaccountable carriage of Sir "George affeded Lady RuSsly So much, that, after having uttered a thouSand unavailing complaints to Eleonora (to whom Sir George, to conceal the true cauSe had given the Same reaSonsfor the unsteadiness of his condud), she reSolv-ed to write to Wallace, and to open her , whole heart to him upon a fubjed which filled her with the greatest nneasineSs, as she knew that he was most Sincerely her friend, and would administer all the conSolation to her in his power.
In this letter, which was written in the height of her inquietude, she mentioned Sir George in the tendered manner, whom she loved with the strongest and sincerest affedion, she repeatedly declared ; but added, that the late change in his humour Seemingly
if
/
Mr. WALLACE. yt
1y proceeding from illneSs, had given her the most aking concern; becauSe she very much feared the anxiety he endured before she had conSented to his wishes, had brought it upon him; and that she would willingly do every thing under the Sanction of honour to remove it, as her life was actually rendered quite unhappy by the wretchedneSs of a man whom she fo truly esteemed. She concluded with intreating him to adviSe her how to a6t upon So delicate an occasion.
^ Sir George, whoSe vexation filled him with emotions beyond expreshon tormenting, happened to be coming up the avenue, when he met his own Servant with the above letter, walking to the post-houSe.
As the fellow did not in the least imagine that he was doing any thing wrong, he was going to paSs his master relpedfully.
Sir
‘y’z The Historv of
Sir George, perceiving the letter? which his Servant had not attempted to conceal, ashed him from whom he received it, and whither he was carrying it.
‘‘ I received it,” Said Harry, ‘‘from “ Lady RuSsly’s man, for whom, as “ I was going to the post-town, I '	“ offered to put it in, as he had a
“ friend come to See him.”
Sir George, transported with all the fury of jealouSy, Snatched the letter out of his hand, and read the Superscription, which being to George WaL lace, ESq; totally deprived him of patience. Without refieifting upon the dishonourable adion which he was about to commit, or upon the consequences which might possibly re-Sult from it, he fiercely charged the Servant, as he valued his favour, not to let a Single word drop from him relating to the letter, or to his having met him with it; then, darting from him, hurried into the most retired part
of
Mr. W ALL AC,E. 73
of the garden, tho’ from an eagerneSs to See the contents, he could icarce refrain from breaking the Seals, as he walked on haftily towards it.
When he had gained a retreat Secure from the eye of observation, and had rapidly peruSed the contents of the letter, the various passions v/hich agitated his boSoin are not to be deScnbed ; at first the^ most violent raptures Seized him, upon finding that he was So dearly beloved ; but they were very much lessened by the shame v/hich he felt at having with Such meanneSs acquired Such delightful intelligence. The dread too , of incurring Lady RuSsly’s anger, for having acted in So indelicate a manner, for having behaved So unlike a gentleman, or to fix in her an. ill opinion of him for ever, the apprehensions of vrhich were lefs fupportable., filled him v/ith unspeakable anxiety, as a cool fettled aversion is infinitely more mortifying than a Sudden ebullition of reSentment, which is Soon over ; eS-VoL.

In this disturbed state of mind, he s ‘first thought of not owning that he shad read the letter, as he could, he believed, venture to depend upon the Secrecy of his Servant; but refiedion, and his real esteem for Lady RuSsly together, would not let him a Second time be guilty of So capital a weak-neSs. No,” Said he, “ tho’ I have “ wronged her, I cannot repeat the injury : I love her, I adore her, and I will not deceive her. She has ‘‘ aded .openly and generoussy; I “ hate mySelf but too much already ‘‘ for having taken fo indiScreet a step ; and will, by the propriety ‘‘ of my future condud, endeavour to make atonement for ite’

the constant attendants on indiScretion, damped his Spirits, while he advanced towards her. With down-cast looks, with trembling steps, he advanced ; nor did she lift up her lovely eyes till he was near her.
Having thrown himSelf at her feet, with all the agitation of a man wavering between hope and fear, “ I come, “ my charming, my amiable Lady “ RuSsly,” cried he, to implore your pardon for a crime, for which, if I am not forgiven, thd’ I have been in the highest degree gladdened by the commission of it, I shall be miserable to the last moment of my “ life."’
She started; she was astonished at So unexpedled an addreSs ; while he tairiy confessed his fault, at the fame time difcloSed the real occasion of it, and in the most tender and Submiffrve terms intreated her SorgiveneSs.
Lady RuSsly was So -much Surprised at what he had done, that she
E 2	was
The Hi.story of
was at first deprived of the powers of Speech she was absolutely struck dumb ; but wshen she restedled upon her beins: in the hands of a man So i capable of deceiving her, she was alSo struck with concern. Deeply concern-sed was she to find that Sir George v/as the man who- had been guilty of . duch disingenuous proceedings, as the giving him up would, she felt, be ^attended with pangs inSupportable.
During her hesitation. Sir George ^continued to intreat, and to make uSe iifof every art he was master of, to move :her in his favour; attributing the itemerity of the adlion to the violence of his love. He concluded with Say-^ ing, that as love was the Sole occasion of the crime which he had committed, she would, if she really loved him with the Sincerity declared in that letter, be candidly inclined to deem it a venial one.
This Speech alarmed all the little pride she was poffeffedof. With a voice
and
Mr. WALLACE... 77'
and air which forcibly discovered' her feelings, “ I never imagined, Sir “ George,” Said she, “ that I should “ be reproached with having shewn too
much affedion for the man whom I “ was going to marry; but you have “ convinced me of my error; Isthank “ you for the convidion Which I fcel; .i “ and yon may thank.yourSelf, if my “ future behaviour to you is diffe-“ rent from what it might have “ been, if you had never induced me"
“ by yours to change it.”
As thefe Words, with the looks which added strength to them, feemed to threaten ail that he had dreaded, and which he but too well deServed, he deSpaired of regaining the place in her heart, which he was now ceitain of having possessed before he took So rash a step for the dissipation of his^i doubts. Half wild, therefore, wdth shame and love, with rapture and re-morfe, he continued in a fupplicating posture at her feet; and strove with" all the most hiimble fubmissions, aided
E 3.	byv '
yS The Hi stop.-y of
by a numerous train of tender arguments, to make her relent; but his arguments were without weight, and his Submissions were disregarded. She ^ still remained inflexible. “ I cannot,’’ Said she, “ with the least prudence, “ place any trust in a man who has “ once deceived me.”
Sir George Said, in his defence, that the torturing, fear of being only the objeft of her pity, and the entire ef-tecm which site had professed for his cousin, had' made him half mad ; and that the sight of her letter to a mam for whom she had frankly owned the truest esteem, had prompted him to be guilty of an adlion for which he should always condemn himSelf: he added, that if she would pardon his first fault, inexcusable as it was, she fltould never have the flightest reaSon to charge him with a Second of the Same nature; that he would receive her pardon as a blessing from heaven ; that flie should be her own mistreSs more than flie was even, with Sir Edward
Mr. W ALLA C E. 79:
ward Rufsly ; that though he doatedi on her to madneSs, he would never approach her apartment, which shouSd.'' be Sacred to her pleaSure, without her' particular permission; that her fortune, houSe, Servants, &c. &c. should be all totally at’ her command ; and that he' would neither interrupt her in the Superintendance of her domestic affairs,-, nor even Solicit the pleafure of her company, when she chofe to be alone.
TheSe and a thouSand other injunctions he laidhimSelf under; and Swore most religioussy to the observance of them ; if she’ would but condeScend to pardon him, and to restore him to her favour, upon the happy footing that he was before he had merited her reSentment. But he pleaded, he protested, and he Swore in vain ; she re-jedled all that he could offer in his behalf, and turned her head from him. Finding, at last, that what he Said had little or no effest, he So^ lemnly declared, still laying at her
E 4	feet,,
8o The Hist OR y of
feet, that he would never part with the dear haind which he held in his ; and that nothing upon earth should make him give up his claim to the dearest, loveliest of her Sex, who had once, he was blest enough to know, loved him, though he had forfeited that blessing by his folly.
Lady Rufsly, finding that Sir George made no effort to rife, but had actually laid his head on her hand, she cooly desired him to rife and leave her.
“ Never, never,” cried he, “ will “ I leave all that I" adore and doat “ on, all that is dear to me in life.
I can part with life freely; but I “ cannot part with my Cecilia. For-“ give me. Lady Rufsly,” continued he, looking wildly on her j “ 'but I “ am almost distradted; and if you

The few last Sentences having been delivered in the most Sorrowing ac- -cents, and accompanied with looks -strongly expressive of frenzy, absolutely frighted her. She, therefore, , upon his repeated intreaties, and upon his eagerly graSping her hand in ’ his with a Suppliant attitude, and a >' dying tenderneSs in his eyes, Said at last, ‘‘ Do pray rISe, Sir (jeorge !”

“ Oh! my: Cecilia, my angel!” cried he, “ when I again offend Such “ SweetneSs, may I never be forgiven. “ I fiiall not deServe to be for-“ given, but to. be a. wretch in-deed.”
He roSe upon her looking mildly on him, and went madly to claSp her" in his arms; but she eluded his graSp, and with a look,of dignified SoftneSs, iaid, “ Hold, Sir.

At the conclusion of this Speech, she walked towards the houSe, and he kept cloSe by her side; but the re-pulSe which he had met with, and the distant reSpedl which she required from him, prevented him from enjoying the Satisfaction, unallayed, whiclr aroSe from his having obtained her' pardon. He made no complaints; but he Severely felt the change in her behaviour;for though she treated him with an eaSy politenels before company, for Some days afterwards, yet when they were together by them-Selves, and when he died with desire to be indulged with thoSe innocent freedoms which are allowable between lovers when every thing is adjusted, (for the writings were actually drawing up), and which she had not before discouraged in him; the cool reServe in her carriage, and the Serious air which llie assumed, whenever he but offered to touch her hand, not only extremely chagrined him, but convinced him, that she would be in lio hurry to re-E 6-	store

store him to the favour v/hich he had before enjoyed; and that much more time than he had at first imagined, would be thought necessary to try the sincerity of his repentance. She would not, indeed, have pronounced his pardon So readily, had he not by the violence of his complaints, and the distrastion of his behaviour, almost dragged it from her by compulsion. As she really loved him, she could not bear to See him So distressed : compassion and love are very nearly related, and are rarely aiunder.
Sir George being very apprehensive, from the coolnefs of Lady'Rufsly’s carriage to him, that she was grown quite indifferent about him, became extremely dejedted, more So than he hao ever yet been. He complained to Mils Wallace, and pressed her to stand his friend : but he complained to no purpoSe; she freely told him that as he had brought all the grievances under which he Smarted, upon
him lei f.

himSelf, he deServed all the Sufferings which he endured; adding, that if Mr. MonSon had adled the Same part in a similar Situation, she never would have Seen him ao-ain. He was, therefore, once more obliged to have recourSe to his cousin George, for the exertion of his friendship, who had innocently occasioned all the mifchief which had happened. But Wallace, whofe honest heart abhorred all deceit, and would Sooner have lost the woman on whom he doated to diS-tradlion, than have taken any improper steps to gain her; and who had, besides, a very great esteem for Lady RuSsly; plainly anSwered, that he could not with honour interpoSe in Such an affair; and that the lady, who had really been, in his opinion, injured, must Solely determine a point of which she was the only competent judge, as her happineSs was So nearly concerned in it. “ Leave it, there-“ fore, my dear Sir George,” added he, ‘‘ to the goodnels of Lady “ RuSsly’s disposition.

This letter, tho’Sensible and friendly, did not afford the conSolation which Sir George expeCted to receive from his cousin: Some passages in it, indeed, tho’ intended -to convey comfort, rather Served to increaSe his uneaSineSs; lo certain is it, that people who merely Seek the gratification of theirpassions at the expence of probity and truth, frequently turn things designed for their benefit and relief, to their disturbance and diScompolure. However, tho’ he was not So wtU pleaSed with his friend as he ought to have been, he follov/ed his advice with great punctuality ; neglecting nothing which might, he
thought,
Mr. W A L L A C E.
thought, restore him to La'dy RuSsly’S good opinion, without teazing her to give him the proofs of it which he wished, but which he feared to aSk. But bis anxiety had thrown a melancholy air over his whole perSon, which touched her more than all he could have Said.
One evening, when Sir George, Lady RuSsly, MonSon, and Eleonora, were walking by the side of a piece of water in the gardens at Woodby, Sir George appeared to be So entirely buried in refiedtion, that Mr. MonSon, clapping him on the shoulder, while they stopped to look at Some fish which 'were Sporting upon the Surface of the canal, Said, ‘‘You are quite lost “ in thought, Sir George.”
Sir George started at his touch, and, with a deep sigh, casting his eyes again upon the water, replied, “Would I could never think again !”
TheSe

TheSe few words, the manner In‘ which they were pronounced, and the continuance of his fixed posture, while they were walking on, struck Lady RuSsly with a concern which she had not felt for him before.
Finding that he did not follow them, but remained in his pensive attitude, she turned back, and pacing fiowly towards him. Said, with an unuSual tenderneSs of voice ; ‘‘ What “ So Serioussy engages your attention, “ Sir George
“ The late unfortunate error in my “ conduD, my lady,” replied he sighing, which, as it will not, in all “ probability, be effaced from your memory, will ever be deeply im-“ printed on mine.

world in which I cannot hope to be happy.”
As this Speech was delivered' with an air of the most Settled and gloomy diScontent, Lady RuSsly was truly alarmed, yet undertook to calm his disturbed mind, by urging the Solid advantages of patience and moderation ; affuring him, that when he had brought himSelf to curb the violence of his passions, she would look upon him in the light in which he had appeared to her, before he had induced her to change her opinion about him..
And what objedlion have you “ to my preSent behaviour ?” Said he; ^ have I committed any new offence ^ “ On the contrary, have I not stUr-‘‘ dioussy endeavoured to obey you; “ by keeping the cruel: distance “ which you required ^ Oh!

been Softened to love, could you “ have Seen my Sufferings So long without vrishing to relieve them ?”
Lady RuSsly, hurt to find her ten-derneSs SuSpedted, replied , “ that the letter which he So freely opened, had, she thought, contained the strongest ‘‘ and the Sincerest proofs of her love, “ and that he would be the most un-reasonable of men to desire more.”
I never did ; I do not now,” interrupted he, eagerly, desire more ; . "■ treat me but as you did when I “ was guilty of that fault, and I shall be the happiest of human beings.”
How do I know,” Said she, Softening her voice, “ that you will not "" prefume upon my indulgence, and “ take still greater liberties with me “ How can I be Safe with a man fo “ difpoSed to be SuSpicious ? If you “ -loved me as you ought to love me,

She was too much affedted to proceed : the real anxiety which she endured to See him So uneaSv; her ten-derneSs for him, which she Scarce knew how to conceal any longer; and her apprehenSions lest he should be still jealous of Wallace, almost over-powered her. Sitting down, therefore, upon a bench by the side of the canal, she leaned her head on her hand, and hid her face with that and her handkerchief.

He was melted at the sight, and accuSed himSelf in Such reproachful terms of having been the cauSe of her uneasi-neSs, and intreated her with So much tender assiduity, to be compoled, -to forgive him, and to try him once more; that turning her Sweet eyes towards him full of tears, she gave him that hand which she had lately So often withheld from him, and Said, There, Sir George, once more take “ my hand, and may you never re-proach me again for having thus “ yielded to the force of my affedi-“ onate feelings in yourfavour. Your “ continual complaints will not “ permit me any longer to resist them.’*
With difficulty she breathed out theSe few words. Sir George, enraptured with what he had heard, gave her indeed no time to make an addition to them. He strained her to his beating boSom; and notwith-.standing all her struggles, and blushing

She chid him ; but he plainly perceived that She loved him too well to fnake another quarrel with him ; and that the tender awe with wliich he approached her. Soon diSarmed her rising anger.
They now grew more pleaSed with each other than they had ever been, and consequently more happy in tstemSelves. Sir George found out in a short time, with new tranSports, that if he doated on his Cecilia, she was no lefs attached to him. This discovery animated him to employ all his povyrs of pleasing; and the modest fatisfadlion with which they were received and returned, increaSed his passion for her. He wrote an extatic letter to Wallace, and with the per-iisission of his dear Cecilia, hastened

Vfhile they only waited till the writings were finished, Wallace, on his return one evening from Some bu-iineSs in which he had been engaged near Ranelagh, stepped in there, for a little relaxation. It happened to be at the end of the SeaSon ; and as it was Soon to be shut up, almost all the people left in town who v/ere fond of the entertainments there, were assembled; confequently it was a crowded night.
In his circular walk he Several times met Lady Frances, accompa-mied by a gentleman and two ladies. He always Saw her with pleaSure ; but he never Saw her without emotion ; he, therefore, constantly averted his eyes from an objed vrhich filled him with many difquieting fenfations. -Quick, however, as he was with the movement of his eyes, he perceived a Lind of languor andmelancholy in her,

Wallace, tho’ never leSs inclined to gallantry than at that instant, felt himSelf strongly desirous to contribute to the accommodation of this amiable creature ; and as he had been Serviceable to one of the waiters, who had lived sin Mr. Brereton’s family, she Soon, by his means, gained a vacant box, and, with the most reSpeftful politeneSs, offered it to the gentleman for the ladies of his party, who Seemed to be fatigued.

him exceedingly; he knew not what' to make of the perSon who delivered ' them : but as he had never felt him-felfiSo much moved, he did not wish ■ to behold her again; he, therefore, ■ ■quitted the place immediately.
His condudt alSo had no leSs asto^‘ nifiied and diSconcerted Lady Frances.

When she had opened her heart to -her father, she fell on her knees before him, begged him to pardon her weakneSs, and to conceal it, if-he had ' the least affedion for her.-

When she was a little compoSed, he . ' left her, and made Several enquiries after Wallace and his family, and found that Lady RuSsly, to whom every body believed him tenderly attached, was on the point of being married to Sir George : nor could he by all his enquiries learn that Wallace had made his addresses to (he could not, indeed, hear that he visited, or that he confessed a partiality for) any woman.
PleaSed v/ith this intehSgence, concerning the truth of which he was troubled with no doubts, he returned home, and in a few days afterwards,

“ You have always,” continued his lordship, “ Spoken So much in praiSe of the pleaSant village in “ which you v/ere brought up, m.y “ dear, that I long to See it. Let us make a tour northward.”
Lady Frances blushed at the mention of a place which had been So interesting to her ; but as she expressed no repugnance to his propoSal, he prepared to Set out immediately, before she had time to rested: upon his mo > tives : she was too penetrating, however, to be deceived by his preparations ; and could not be perSuaded to

Lord T'-------■, knowing that it
was vacation-time, and having heard that Wallace intended to go down to Spend his leiSure weeks with his father and mother, contrived to be at the end of his journey, before Wallace departed from London. He had previoufiy Sent his gentleman down to hire a houfe for him, and to procure intelligence about Dodtor Wallace and his family, with orders, however, not to proclaim his title in the neiglibourhood ; but to take the houSe in his own name.
Mr. Stevens, the perSon thus employed, executed his lord’s commands with the most exa6t pumstuafity, and returned to London with a very fatis-fadlory account of the doblor, who was beloved by the whole village.

When Lord	and Lady'
Frances were almost at the end of their journey, the sight of a place in which she had Spent her infancy, and the recolleftion of the many happy hours which she had enjoyed in the company of Wallace (when from the innocence of her heart she Scarce knew the Source of the pleaSure which she felt in being near him) drew sighs-from her gentle boSom. Her fond father, observing her emotion, diverted " her attention, by ashing a number 01 questions relating to a village So well > known to her. Every creature she Saw, as she passed, was gladly remembered by her, while the rank she now appeared in, prevented them from-recognizing her, and kept them at an humble distance.
The death of Mr. and Mfs.'= Edwards (for he did not long Survive his wife) drew alSo So many tears from her r eyes, that'the earl, more than ohce, . repented of having brought her- to a F 5	place, ,

place, which only Seemed to increaSe her melancholy.
However, after a day’s rest and refreshment, when he thought that she could bear the sight of her old friends, without being too much affedled, he Sent for the doctor, by way of aSking his advice about her health.
The good old man was struck at the sight of a perSon once So well known to him ; tho’ she was consider’ ably grown and improved in beauty : paleneSs, indeed, had of late overspread her countenance; but at the sight of the dodor, a roSy red animat-, ed it.
When the first compliments were exchanged, Dr. Wallace Said, “ A few ‘‘ years ago, my lord, I was acquaint-“ ed with a face fo exadly like this “^lovely young lady, that I couldal-‘V^piost believe her and your daugh-“ ter to be the fame perSon, did not V their very different Situations in life

She would have added Something alSo about his Son, but tender -emotions tied up her tongue, and obstruded her utterance.
This discovery naturally introduced an eclairciffement concerning her concealed birth; which my lord diS-cloSed in a few words ; but Said, that he would defcend to more minute particulars when they Saw Mrs, Wallace

The coach was ordered to fetch them to dinner, as MiSs Nancy was in a very indifferent state of health ; but Lady Frances, thinking that the Surprize might come too Suddenly upon her, on a first visit in a strange houSe, desired her father's leave to gO with the dodtor, and to make herSelf known to her by degrees.
The earl very warmly applauded this good-natured propoSal. The good dodtor, transported with joy, on ob-' Serving So much friendship in her for his family, and charmed with the affable manner in which she had expreff-ed it, cried out, ‘‘ that he had “ known her from her childhood; that “ she was always looked upon as a little cherub; that she was now grown up into an angel; and was come a-“ mong them to make them happy.’*
A ten-

Mr. WALLACE. 109
A tender sigh, arising from an ap-prehenSion that Wallace might not be of the Same opinion with regard to her, was the only reply which she made.
The conversation in the coach turned chiefly upon the death of Mr. and Mrs. Edwards, till they arrived at the door of the dodor’s houSe, where they were accosted by Mrs. Wallace, who< instantly recognizing her ladyship, cried out, “ MiSs Lefly, do I fee you “ once again ?” and went to Salute her.
“ You do indeed, my dear,” Said the dodor; “ but she is no longer Fanny Lefly with whom you may. take theSe liberties; she is now “ Lady Frances, and the only daughter of Lord T------.”
Mrs. Wallace, upon this information, reSpedfully drew back. Lady Frances then taking her round the neck, cried, “ Were it poshble for “ me in this change in mv situation

Mrs.. Wallace was no leSs pleaSed than' the doclor had been; with^ the amiable; carriage Of their new-found acquaintance; and the meeting between her and MiSs Nancy Wallace, wa$-still more affedting. That young lady, though not strikingly like her brother, reSembled him enough to int'erest Lady Frances very much in her favour..

The Sudden mention of the man whom she So much wished to See, made the roSes get the better of the lilies in the cheeks of Lady Frances, who, with a faultering voice. Said,

This reply gave the fond mother, who doated on her- Son, (and indeed with reaSon, for since the death of his wife, he had Settled an handSome annuity on his family) an opportunity to expatiate very largely in his praiSe. What she advanced in his favour did not at all tend to lessen the emotions wshich Lady Frances felt at the first found of his name.

upon being ordered by his grandfa-ither to make his compliments to that lady, stew up into her lap, and without any ceremony threw his innocent arms round her neck, and put his little mouth to hers. Having been accustomed to behave in that way to his ; grand-mother, he knew no other way of shewing his regard.
This behaviour of the child’s, however, innocent and bewitching as it was, increased the confusion of Lady Trances, wshich the dodlor perceiving, made a number of apologies for his grandSon’s vivacities ; though she repeatedly affured him, that she was quite pleaSed with the pretty boy, and returned his carestes in the most affectionate manner, insisting upon taking him home to dinner with them. .
From that moment she took So much pleaSure in the child, and invented So many amufements for him, that when she was in the room, he would never stay Sear any other perSon ; and, in a

By the most innocent and amiable methods did this charming girl Secure the esteem of the doctor’s family, before the darling of it made his appearance, whom they did not acquaint with the agreeable change in their neighbourhood by the post, be-cauSe they hourly expedted him in perSon.
The change in the neighbourhood was indeed particularly agreeable to the Wallaces, in every reSpedj as
Lord T—------- perpetually Sent for,
or called uport, the dodtor; and Lady Frances as frequently made the ladies happy, either by going to them herSelf, or by fending the coach for MiSs Nancy to air in, which was often accompanied by fine fresh ve-niSon, and the richest fruits in feaSon.
Luckily
II4 The HisToRy of
Luckily for both theSe young people, Wallace arrived at his father’s one evening, when the earl and his daughter were engaged; he was, therefore, previoussy acquainted with the story of the latter, and, in Some meaSure, prepared to meet her whom he had never ceaSed to admire, tho’ he had now no hopes of gaining her, as he believed her to be entirely above him, and to have quite forgotten her former Situation. To be assured that Lady Frances was indeed his Fanny, was only an addition to his diS-quietude. He Was diSconcerted at finding that he must be perpetually obliged to fee, and to converSe with, a woman So peculiarly agreeable to him; a woman, for whom he had ever felt the tenderest SenSations ; a woman who had thrown Such a lustre upon her perSonal improvements, and intellectual charms, by the winning affability of her manners, and her renewed attachment to the family with whom she was first acquainted ; but though he imputed that renewed attachment
Mr. WALLACE. 115
tachment entiiely to the pleaSure which she felt at the sight of thoSe with whom she had Spent the earliest part of life upon the intimate footing of'a relation, he knew that he should be most Sensibly affedted whenever he was introduced to her. A thouSand times did he repent of having made his annual visit, just when
the earl of T---- and his daughter
happened to be in the neighbourhood ; and as many times did he wish that he ,could have formed any reasonable excuSe for his immediate return to town, or, indeed, to any other place not visited by the formidable Lady Frances. He prevailed on himSelf, however, to remain where he was, from a conSciouSneSs that he should, by flying from his family, who almost; adored him, just at a time too when they appeared So overjoyed at having it in their power to give him pleaSure in the acquaintance of this new friend of theirs, make them very uneaSy. He thought too, that it would be doubly

■ \
IAS The HisToRy of
cruel to disappoint them, as they had for a long while expedled him, and as he had been longer than uSual detained by particular businels. He felt like a good Son, and a good bro-* ther, and acted accordingly.
The dodtorand Mrs. Wallace, upon-their Soffs arrival, promiSed them-Selves a great deal of Satisfadlron,. in gratefully endeavouring to return, in Some meaSure, the civilities which
they had received from LordT---------
and Lady Frances, by the entertainment arising from the Society of that Son, whom they looked upon, and very justly with all their partiality, to be a fit companion for any gentleman. Theoblique commimication,therefore, of their feelings, upon his arrival,, prevented his hasty departure ; but he appeared to be much diSconcerted, ^ much mortshed, when they all eagerly launched out in praiSe of Lady Franees,, ©Shis.once loved Fanny; and So often Said, “ Why did you not write to me to V let me. know whom 1 was to expedt

Mr. WALLACE. ii^
to See,’’that his careful mother feared he was Suddenly taken ill. His repeated questions, to the Same p.urpoSe,.to Nancy, obliged them at length to tell , him the truth ; to tell him that, as he was hourly expefted, he would, they thought, be agreeably SurpriSed : but they were mistaken. He, on the contrary, absolutely dreaded the sight of that amiable creature.
Wallace never once imagined that
'the -earl of T‘--- with his only,
his lovely daughter, who was heireSs to his very large estate, could condescend to let her become the wife of the 'Son of a country dodtor, as Sir Robert MonSon had stiled his father, and that Son in bufineSs too. The haughty treatment, indeed, which he received from Sir Robert, had rather given him a diSgust to arf alliance with people of rank •, it had alSo made him refolve not to put himSelf in the way of a Second refuSal, at least, of that kind ; and to think of Seducing the .affedions of So amiable a child as ^	Lady
ii8 The History of
Lady Frances, from So excellent a father as the earl was, with reaSon, reputed (Supposing a possibility of SucceSs), was, in his opinion, a crime of the deepest die. So high were his notions of honour, that he would rather have voluntarily Sacrificed his life, than have made the most indirect: attempts towards SeduDion.
With theSe noble Sentiments, and a heart glowing with admiration, esteem, and love, did Mr. Wallace first meet Lady Frances in that village where they had formerly Spent So many in-nocently-happy hours ; and it would be hard to Say, whether he or she felt the strongest emotions, as they were both determined to conceal them; the latter, from her never enough to be commended delicacy ; and the other, from his exalted principles. Nor could their fathers, though both of them the kindest of parents, be of any Service to them ; for the extreme fear of I^ady Frances, lest she should be offered to a man who did not lovx
her
Ir. WALLACE. 119
her well enough to make his addresses to her first, had impelled her to intreat the earl in the strongest terms to wait till his conSent had been demanded. On the other side, the good dodlor vrould have thought it the highest preSumption to think of offering his Son to a lady far Superior in rank and fortune. Nor did he, indeed, in the least believe that his fon looked upon her but on as a woman of uncommon accomplishments, both personal and intelleftual; fo carefully had he concealed his fenSations, concealed them even from his mother and sister; in doing which he had no very eaSy taste, as women are generally more curious about, and more penetrating in, love matters than men. However, as it was the earl’s businefs to forward an affair upon which the felicity of his daughter fo much depended, and as he was not the leSs eager to forward it, on a nearer acquaintance with young Wallace, he gave, nay, procured h’s daughter
every
120 The HiSTORy of
every opportunity to diScover the beauties of her perSon and mind to him, in a proper manner ; and adled with So much addreSs upon the occasion, that every thing Said or done, either by him or her. Seemed to be So eaSy and natural, and to proceed from Such excellent intentions, that 'every body admired them, without siiSpeDing their designs.
As Lady Frances and Wallace were both musical, my lord contrived little concerts, in which they dilplayed their taste and execution to each other’s admiration.
Sometimes my lord invited the other young inhabitants of the village to form rural dances, at which, as Wallace happened to be the highest in rank among his neighbours, he was of coLirSe destined to be the partner of Lady Frances; yet, amidst all the intimacy to which he was now admitted, he never took the ssightest freedoms,
and
Mr, WALLACE. i2r
and tho’ a little gallantry is upon Such occasions every where allowable, nothing of that kind was attempted by him: he always behaved, in thofe' situations, with the politest reSpedt, and with the most attentive assiduity; and by So doing, probably made a deeper impression upon the heart of Lady Frances, than if he had adopted the carriage common among young people of different Sexes in Such cir-cumftances.
As Lady Frances had, from the first, admired and esteem.ed Wallace for his virtues, and thoSe virtues had been So much strengthened by the steadineSs of his adherence to the pradlice of them, and by the trials which he had met with in life; and as the modest circumSpeftion of his behaviour had encreaSed her former good opinion of him ; nay. So entirely captivated her, that she admired, she esteemed him a thousand times more than ever, and strove by

every word, every look, and every adlion, to make herSelf agreeable to him, though she would rather have died than have declared what she felt on his account, till he had first discovered a passion for her; her feelings, indeed, on his account, were almost too powerful to be concealed; but she confined them within her own boSom, for reaSons already mentioned.
Had Wallace really imagined that Lady Frances loved him, he would have been still more backward in taking notice of her pashon for him, till it had either received her father’s approbation, or till that father had uSed her with unkindneSs; but as he attributed all her amiable and winning carriage towards him and his family, to an exceffive generosity of disposition, and to the overflowings of the most benevolent heart in the world, he was, through gratitude, silent, and adored thoSe charming virtues in Secret, which he, at the fame

time dying with desire, longed openly to applaud.
While each of them, however, was adluated by Such Sentiments, they imperceptibly became more intimately acquainted, and were, of courSe, upon a freer footing together, than they had ever been before.
Lady Frances conSulted his taste in music and in reading'; and having communicated it to her father, wlio always approved, formed her own cxatflly upon it. Her father, indeed, was So much pleaSed with her choice, that he frequently endeavoured to prevail on her to let him make a pro-poSal to Wallace, which would certainly, he told her, be received with transport.
Never, never, my dear father,” Said she, embracing him with her eyes Sull of tears, and with her breast heavmg with sighs, ‘‘ never shall you ‘‘ loSe your daughter upon Such

A shower of tears followed the few last words, which affeded the earl most Sensibly, though he at the Same time approved of her Spirit.

Just at that junfture, the Sudden entrance of Wallace, who had been Sent to Lady Frances v:ith a meffage from his mother, not a little diSconcertetl her. She had Scarce dine to wipe away the tears from her eyes, the remains of which on her Sweet face, toge- , ther with the dejedfion fpread over it, touched him to the Soul.
The earl, ever obServant of his looks, fancied that he Saw a tender concern painted in them, and, taking advantage of his SuppoSed diScovery, Said, “ You come most opportunely,
Mr. Wallace; my Fanny is quite ‘‘ in the vapours; you must, there-“ fore stay, and endeavour to divert “ her.”
Wallace bovred, and the earl left them together.
As Wallace truly felt for Lady Frances, he reSpedfully strove to open a conversation the most amusing he could think of; but she, v/ho w'as but too

well convinced that he was the cauSe of her Sorrow, and fearing alSo that he might diScover his own power over her by her dejefted appearance. Said with a Smile, which increaSed her personal attradfions, “You are SurpriSed “ to See me in tears, Mr. Wallace ; “ but they have been occasioned by “ the extreme indulgence of the most “ excellent of fathers : gratitude and “ affeftion frequently excite tender , “ SenSations.’*
“ The tenderest of all,” replied he, wiping his own eyes, which Sympha-thized with hers; “ and may you “ never., Lady Frances, weep from “ any other cauSe; you never will, if ** my most fervent wiSnes and prayer* “ for your felicity are heard.”
She thanked him with the fame sincerity ; but could not get the better of her dejedlion. Vfhen the earl returned, he found her not much more chearful than he left her. As to Wallace, he became every day more transported
Mr. WALLACE, lay
ported with her; he drank large draughts of love from her eyes; and from the continued proofs wdiich she exhibited of a fine understanding, a benevolent disposition, and an amia-. ble heart, his esteem for her was continually increasing. He knew no joy but in her preSence, yet, dreading to trust himSelf with her, and always leaving her with additional regret, his life adlually became burthenibme to him.
Thus inflamed by a passion which grew more and more violent every hour, the tormenting SenSations which he endured at length injured his health : he was. lei zed with a feverish diforder, and he was obliged to confine himSelf to the houfe.
Lady Frances was extremely alarmed when she heard of it, and the earl was not lefs affected by the intelligence, on his account, and becaufe he pitied his daughter.
G 4	They
128 The Hist OR y of
They Sent every hour to enquire after him, and offered every Service in their power to procure eaSe and relief for him.
Lady Frances Sent her woman to fit up with him, who, though ignorant of the force of her lady’s Sentiments in his favour, could not but know that he was very much esteemed by her; and not being of a retentive disposition, though otherwise a good kind of girl, she communicated a number of little trifles which she had taken notice of in her lady’s behaviour, which were imputed by the dodlor’s family merely to the excefs of hercompashon and good-nature; but Wallace, who could not be deaf to her communications, was touched in a particular manner by them, and considered all the humane and affeflionate expressions which Lady Frances had dropped about his indisposition, as So many evident proofs of her regard for him. They had, indeed, an amazing effed: upon his health: as he was fully aS-
stired.
Mr. WALLACE. 129
'Sured, that if he was not beloved, he was, at leash not hated by her, they contributed to the restoration of it; though from the remains of his iilneSs, and from the keenneSs of his Sensibility, he was oppressed with So melancholy a languor, that his father and mother, not being acquainted with the real cauSe of it, were apprehensive of a decline.
This apprehcnfion exceedingly alarmed them, and their fears about his entire recovery were, for fome time, rather increafed than diminished..
When he began to sit up, the earl made frequent visits to him, nay frequently brought his daughter with him,
who, with all tlie kindneSs and innocent familiarity of a sister, strove to amuSe and divert him; though the paleneSs of his fine face, once So remarkably blooming, and the heavy, but half Suppressed Sighs which her charming oshciouSneSs drew from him, perpetually brought tears into
G 5	her
1^0 The HisTORy of
her lovely eyes. In theSe melting moments she turned aside to wipe them off, and then Smiled on as if nothing had interrupted her chear-fulneSs.
As Soon as he was able to go abroad, the earl insisted upon his airing in his coach; made himSelf often. Lady Frances always, of the party, who watched the looks of her dear invalid with the most anxious Solicitude : and whenever she thought that he was faint or weary, ordered the coach to stop, while he took Some refreshment, or to drive gently homewards, just as he choSe.
The continued, the unwearied proofs of her attention made her almost adored in the village for her good-nature; but thoSe proofs absolutely destroyed Wallace’s peace ; he could not exist, he could not breathe any longer near her, and confine his hourly-indreaSing passion within his own boSom; he, therefore, reSolved

Mr. WALLACE. i|i
take the only step which v/as left for him, that is, to sty for ever from her, and to strive, by abSence and by rea-Son, to conquer an inclination, which now made him at once both happy and wretched : he only wished that he had quitted the village beSore.
Thus determined, he came into his mother’s apartment one morning, in which he unexpedtedly found Lady Frances fitting with his little boy in her lap; his head lay on her neck, and she was kissing him with the greatest fondineSs.
She'started at the sight of Wallace ; her face and neck were covered with a crimSon colour ; and she haS-tily Set down the child.
Wallace,, affedted beyond expression at this Scene, was not master enough of himSelf to check the transport which he felt upon the oc-eaSion. Oh! do not,” Said he, G 6	“ do
132 The History of
‘‘ do not let me drive him from that ‘‘ heavenly boSom.'*
As he had never thrown out So^ animated an exclamation before, she was pleasingly confuSed ; and hope flattered her all the rest of the day. But,- how cruelly was site diSap-Vpointed next morning, when the dodlor informed her father, that his-dear Son was determined to leave them, imagining that he should be better in another air ; that his intention had made his mother, and, indeed, the whole family, very uneaSy ; and that he had taken the liberty to intreat his lordship to join with them in perSuading him to remain where he was ; declaring at the Same time,, he should not have troubled his lord-ship, had he not known how infinitely his Son reSpedled him, and how much influence his lordship^s commands had over him.
Thefe
i
Mr. WALLACE. 1^3
TheSe, and many other stronger reaSons were given by the good old man, to add weight to his intreaties for he could not bear to think of being deprived of his Son’s company, while he was in So bad a state of health.
The earl, full as Unwilling to be deprived of Wallace’s company, promised to make uSe of all his eloquence upon the occasion.
When the dodfor returned, he, Mrs. Wallace, and Nancy, all united to dissuade Wallace from the execution of his designs, and availed them-Selves of the most cogent arguments: they could think of to six his continuance with them ; but he oppoSed all their arguments and their perfua-fions, though in the genteeleft manner ; for he most affedVionately loved and esteemed the whole family.
While Wallace, however, was preparing for his departure, he knew not
bow
ig4 "Tfic Histokv of
how to bear the thoughts of bidding Lady Frances adieu. To go off abruptly, without taking leave, after having received So many marks of , her politeneSs, shocked his gratitude : he, therefore, called up all his fortitude, and, towards evening, went to . the earl.
My lord, when the doDor had left him in the morning, related to his daughter all that he had communicated to him; and tried to comfort her, as she had been almost in an agony of despair; being now affured, she Said, that she had made no impression upon him, as he was So desirous to leave her.
“ I am not So certain,” replied her father, “ that you have made no im-pression upon Wallace ; but your fear and your anxiety have pre-“ vented you from taking notice of “ many things. Seemingly trivial,
“ which have not eScaped my obSer-y vation. I only wish, my dear, that
“ you
Mr. WALLACE. 135
“ you would give me leave to put an “ end to your doubts concerning him
diredlly.”
Lady Frances, tho’ she loved and ' revered her father to an uncommon degree, had Such refined notions about delicacy, that she could not bring her-Self to conSent to his request.
Wallace found the earl and his daughter in a tite-a-tete: upon his entrance, the former urged every thing which he deemed likely to move him to stay in the village, and then quitted the room, after having Said,
“ But I leave my daughter to insist “ upon your remaining with us :
“ Sure, Wallace, you cannot refuSe « her.’’
A deep sigh was the only anSwei which he returned.
After a mournful Silence between them, which continued for Some mo-ments. Lady Frances, with the most

tender air imaginable, in the most win~ ning accents, and with the most'rnelr ing expressions, endeavoured to pre“ vail on him to comply with the united intreaties of his friends; and, in order to enSorce her endeavours, and in Some meaSure to apologize for the part she had undertaken, added, “ Your fa-“ ther, your mother, your Sister, and the earl, Mr. Wallace, have all ‘‘ insisted upon my trying to perSuade “ you to stay here ; my own fears and wishes for the re-establishment of your health, have possibly urged “ me to join their requests more “ strongly than may have been a-“ greeabie to you; but I hope,’" continued she, throwing down her eyes with a Sweet humility, “ that you wdll pardon me for interesting “ mySelf So much about your hap-pineSs and health.”
Wallace, not able to Support his firmneSs against So powerful a pleader, and still leSs able to leave her, knowing that the Separation would be painful
Mr. WALLACE. 137
ful to her, felt himSelf torn to pieces by the various SenSations which love, honour, and duty, thwarting each other, had kindled in his breast.
He turned from her Several times, to hide the emotions of his heart, which stew into his face. At length, reSolving to make one grand effort, lie Said, with a faultering voice, “ My obligations to the earl, my particular obligations to Lady “ Frances, can never, by the Ser-vices of my whole life, were thofe Services worthy of their aeceptance, “ be repaid ; but if they are Sin-“ cere,"^ added he, in a tone wholly Softened, “ and I am well affured “ that they are So, will not Lady “ Frances, allow me to go ? as the “ restoration of my health can only “ be effested by my departure from “ hence.”
TheSe words, though with the greatest difficulty and reiustance pronounced, were decisive. She misconstrued
The History of
strued them entirely, and, believing that he never liked her, that he Wished to be Somewhere elSe, and that he should never See her again, was quite overpowered by her tenderneSs. 1 he shock was too Severe to be stiS-tained by her, and she fainted away upon the Sofa on which she Sat.
To deScribe the, feelings of Wallace at that alarming moment, is utterly impoffible. He stood awhile motionleSs ; shut, looking on her with the most affeding concern, love, at lash prompted him to assist her.
He Sat down by her; he took her in.shis arms, and strove, by tenderly calling on her, to bring her to her-Sclf; till half distraded with the condition she was in, and with his own feelings, and not knowing certainly the real cauSe of her Sudden Swoon, though he partly guessed at it, he threw out the most pathetic exclamations, offered up the most fervent prayers to heaven for her recovery,
and
Mr. WALLACE. 139
and lamented the difference in their situations, which obliged him to keep up Such a distance with her, “ Oh ! that I might but diScover,’* cried he, ‘‘ what my bursting heart ‘‘ at this instant feels ! Oh 1 that “ it were in my power, that I dared “ but to endeavour to drive away ‘‘every painful fenSation, even the “ least imeasineSs, from that dear, “ lovely boSom, in which all my hap-“ pineSs is Seated.”
Lady Frances, whoSe SenSes wer« just returning as he uttered the last Sentence, lost not a single Syllable of it, tho’ she had not strength Sufficient to Speak. The words which he had delivered, So necessary to her peace,, were far more efficacious than the contents of an eau-de-luce bottle, which, having found in his pocket, he held to her noSe.
Rising, at length, gently, and withdrawing herSelf from his arms, she modestly thanked him for the
assistance
140 The HisTORy of
assistance which he had afforded her, while her face glowed with blushes.
“ And novr, Mr. Wallace,” continued she, with the Sweetest voice, “ I have but one request to make, “ with which, 1 hope, you will be “ indulgent enough to me to comply, “ not to leave us till to-morrow is “ over : after that day, I give you “ my word, you shall be entirely at ‘‘ your liberty.”
Wallace, full of love, confusion, and amazement, bowed—hoped that she was recovered—wished to have, been able to relieve—feared that she was not yet well—'and left her, -in a manner that gave her more pleafure than she had ever received from him..
Wallace, when he retired from her preSence, went to ruminate upon the luddennefs of her indiSpoSition, and on her final request.
When the earl returned to See how his daughter’s rhetoric had operated upon
the
Mr. WALLACE. 141 '
the passions of her lover, she related to him every thing that had pasted between them, and rendered him So pleaSed with her intelligence, that he-hurried away in Search of him.
Just as he was going out of the room, she stopped him, and, with a Supplicating look, cried, “ Oh, Spare “ your daughter, my lord !”
My beloved child, my amiable ‘‘ Fanny,” replied the fond father,
‘‘ is not thy honour dearer to me “ than my own ?”
The earl was So transported with the unintended diScovery of Wallace’s inclinations, that he waited for no replv, but stew to Search for him.
Flaving found him, walking with agitated steps, in a grove near the dodlor’s, in which were placed Some benches at proper distances, he Sat down ; and, making a motion for
him
142 The IIisTORy of
him to sit alSo, Said, when he had looked stedfastly at him for a few moments, “ Wallace, do you love
my daughter
Wallace, struck with the abruptness of the question, a question in which his heart was So much interested, w’as unable to make an imme-mediate anSwer ; while the blood starting into his cheeks, and a tremor, which shook his whole frame, evidently ascertained the justncSs of the earl’s conjectures, and filled the mea-lure of his wishes.
Upon the repetition of the question, Wallace, still trembling, replied, “ Love Lady Frances, my lord!”
Aye.” Said the earl with the most complacent Smile, “ is she not “ formed to be loved ?”
“ Certainly, my lord,” replied the still GonfuSed Wallace, ‘‘ to be adored
“ by
Mr. WALLACE. 141
“ by thoSe who are by rank and for-tune rendered deServing of her.”
‘‘ Say rather, my friend,” anSwer-ed the earl, “ who are rendered wor-. “ thy of her by true tenderneSs and “ intrinsic merit; and as I firmly be-** sieve that no young man is poffeffed ** of more tenderneSs or more merit “ than yourSelf, you have my free “ leave to make your addresses to my “ daughter, and to try to gain her “ affections.”
A bullet directed to the breast of Wallace, would not have filled him with more astonishment than he felt at the latter part of his lordship’s Speech; he stood aghast! confounded before him. At last, quite overwhelmed with a Soft confusion, with emotions too exquisitely thrilling to be expressed, he turned his head, and, with tremulous accents, cried, “ Oh !
my lord, this is too: too much— “ it comes So Suddenly upon me—-“ but you are, I know, too noble-
V minded
144 The HiSTORy of
“ minded to trifle with me. Yes, “ my lord, from my first acquaint-ance with Lady Frances, my Soul has floated on her; on her lovely “ perSon, and on her uncommon vir-“ tues I doated long before I knew “ that she was your daughter; but I want words to thank you as 1 ought.’*
“ My dear Wallace,” replied the delighted earl, “ I have been too “ abrupt; I beg your pardon, com-poSe yourSelf; recall your Scattered ‘‘ Spirits ; and when you find your-Self, able to arrange your thoughts, “ tell me, why you thus concealed a “ paffion from me, the difeovery of “ which would have given me, long ago, the sincerest Satisfadtion. You “ have no other attachment?”
None, none, my lord,” faid the enraptured Wallace ; “ but, far as I “ was beneath your daughter, how “ could I lift up my eyes to fo much excellence ? ^nd had I been vain
“ enough
Mr. W A H I- A C E. 145
enough to hope for SucceSs, could “ 1, without the most unpardonable “ preSumption, have endeavoured to “ Seduce the heart of Such a daughter “ from Such a father ? Should I then, rhy lord, have merited the ho-nourable title of your Son
“ Admirable young man !” replied his lordship, touched with his elevated and refined Sentiments ; ‘‘ tho’ few “ deServe my girl, you more than “ merit her; and yet, when you are “ better acquainted with the preSent “ which I am going to confer upon “ you, you will Say with me, that ‘‘ few are like my darling Fanny.”
The earl then desired him to relate, with the most minute exadlneSs, every particular which had passed in his mind relating to his daughter, from the first sight of her ; and, when he ' had finished his narration, faid, “ Go, Wallace, I will keep you no longer “ from vour love ; go, and let her VoL. II.	H	share
X4si The HisTORy, of
‘‘ share my Satisfadion, which is more “ than I can welldeScribe.”
Wallace wanted not the Spur of a Second bidding to do what was So infinitely agreeable to him ; yet, as fear is always inseparable from real love, he felt himSelf under a thouSand apprehensions, lest all the civilities which he had received from her, and which had Sprung, he Sometimes fondly fancied, from a particular partiality for him, might have proceeded only from the exuberance of her goodnature. He dreaded, tho’ he died with impatience, to hear how she would receive his tender addreSs,
When he entered the room with trembling steps, and with a beating boSom, which throbbed at once wdtk hope and fear, she was Sitting with her head leaning on her hand ; an af-fcd'ing languor appeared in her eyes, occasioned' by what she had heard liim Say, during her gradual recovery
from
Mr. WALLACE. 147
fmm her Swoon ; her thoughts, indeed, from that time, had been wholly employed about him.
As Soon as he had Seated him Self by her side, he with accents, and with looks, full of humility and love. Said, ‘‘ I come. Lady Frances, by his lord-“ ship’s permission, earnestly hoping to find your health restored, and “ to offer my tenderest and most re-Spedful Services.”
Fie paufed here.---
“ You must not then leave us, Mr. Wallace,” replied she, with a Sweet roSy Smile.
Never, my adorable Lady Fran-ces,” anlwered he, taking her trembling hand; “ Never, unleSsyou wish “ for my abSence, unleSs you desire “ me to go ; my future happy hours shall be all dedicated to your plea- * y Sure : Supremely blest shall I think , H 2	‘‘ my-
148 The HisTORy of
my Self, if you will but Suffer me ‘‘ to be ever near you.”
He stopped, waiting for her reply; but her full heart would not permit her to Speak : to have every wish of that heart gratified, when she was almost driven to deSpair, was a pleaSure hardly to be Supported : she sighed; she blushed ; she threw down her charming eyes; then raising them all at once, and looking tenderly on him, inough with a bashful timidity, ‘.Do “ you thus addreSs me, Mr. Wallace,” Said she, “ in conSequence of your own “ genuine feelings, or merely in com-“ piiance with my father’s inclina-
tion
Her face glowed at the conclusion of theSe queries, and she pauSed for his anSwer with down-cast eyes, fearing that she had Said too much, and that, from the stutter of her Spirits, she had made too indelicate a discovery.
Why,
Mr. W ALT ACE. T4g.
Why, my dear,- my lovely Lady ^ Frances,” Said he, with an impassioned air, “ do you doubt my, feelings for you ? Yes, my angel,
“ I have, ever since 1 knev/ the mean-ing of the word Love, regarded you “ with the most ardent, the most re-“ Spedlful tenderneSs; and though I was unavoidably engaged, whlie you was abSent from me, at the united intreaties of my own and oS the “ lady’s father, my heart did not one moment forget the amiable MiSs “ Lefiy ; but when the dear objedt of my first, my only real passion was “ restored' to. my longing eyes, in So “ brilliant a light, in a Situation So “ far Superior to my humble hopes,
“ how could I preSume to raiSe my “ thoughts to her, all dear as she “ still was to my fond heart, without “ her father’s app’*oval ^ But, believe me. Lady Frances, neither the for-‘‘ tune, nor the high birth, nor even the excellent qualities of my lord, -could have induced me to tell him FI 3	“ that

You, madam, have long “ poffeffed the last; and if I can “ possibly gain So valuable an heart ‘‘ as yours is in return, I shall be “ indeed Supremely happy ; my only “ Wish will be to render your felicity ‘‘ perfect and permanent.”
Lady Frances, overcome with pleasure at this declaration, the Sincerity of which she had not the least reaSon to question, Said, with a chearfulneSs which had not, for a long time, brightened her features; “ by look-“ ing upon you, Mr. Wallace, in the.
light you wish to appear in to me, “ I hope I shall make you happy, while I acst in obedience to the “ dearest and best of fathers.”
“ And
Mr. WALLACE, i^r
And must I to that worthiest of parents, as I cannot but allow his “ lordship to be ; must I owe entirely “ to him. Lady Frances,” Saiff Wallace, with a plaintive voice, ‘‘ this enchanting hand ? I would Sooner “ have died, than have made the “ fiightest attempt to obtain your con-“ Sent without his approbation. I was almost deprived of health and “ peace of mind, by controlling a “ passion which I could not with pro* “ priety avow without his permission; “yet. Lady Frances, I cannot help “ wiSning, that your inclination may “ accompany your father’s will. If “ duty only prompts you to honour “ me with your lovely hand, I must “ still sigh, still be wretched.”
Fie delivered theSe words v/ith So dejedted an air, and appeared with So disconcerted a countenance, that a strong desire to render him truly happy, conquered all her most delicate Scruples : with a voice, therefore, /	H 4	quite
I5^ The HiSTORy of
quite Softened by the force of the most affedting tenderneSs, she opened her heart to him without any reServe, and informed him of all the uneaSineSs which she had endured on his account, and of every step which her father and herSelf had taken in confequencc of it.
%
Words are wanting to defcribe the transports which he felt at her information ; he claSped her to his boSom, and, while he gazed enraptured on her charming face, glowing with becoming blushes, faid every thing which the most ardent passion could didlate.
On the entrance of her father, while they were in tins delighting and delighted Situation, she whthdrew herSelf from his arms, and Said, with a bashful air,, ‘‘ Don’t think amiSs of me, Mr. Wallace; I was won en-“ tirely by your virtues, though you “ are, I will frankly allow, the most agreeable of men.”
She
/
Mr. WALLACE. 153
She then advanced towards her father, and thanked him in the most grateful and affedionate terms, for all his kindneSs and indulgence to her.
Wallace, during her filial effusions, hung over her enamoured ; and the earl, first joining their hands, embraced them both, with a paternal pressure in his arms, calling them his dear, his amiable, his invaluable children.
It may eaSily be SuppoSed that the dodor’s family were Soon apprized of the happineSs of a Son and brother. So truly, So deServedly beloved by them ; and that their joy was not lefs than his upon the animating occasion.
Letters were immediately diSpatch-ed to Eleonora, Lady Wallace, and Sir George, the last of whom was sincerely pleaSed; in the first place, becauSe he was very glad to hear of his GOuSin George’s good fortune; in the H 5	Second,,
154 The History of
Second, becauSe his cousin v/ould, by his union with Lady Frances, be entirely removed out of the way of his Cecilia, tho’ he had not the fiightest reaSon to imagine, that he was not the Sole possessor of her heart.
Lady Wallace alSo expressed much pleasure at Mr. Wallace’s approaching happineSs, as she had ever very highly esteemed him, and was early in her congratulations upon the completion of it.
As Soon as every thing could be got ready, Wallace and his beloved Fanny were united.
Before his marriage,, he preSented to each of his sisters five thoufand? pounds, and confirmed the annuity , already allowed for his father’s and his mother’s life : but as neither Lady Frances nor her father would Suffer little George to be deprived of any part of his mother’s fortune, the earl gave, with his daughter, So large , .	a Sum
Mr. WALLACE. 155
a Sum down, that Wallace could v/ell afford to exert his generosity in So noble a manner; and to quit, likewiSe, all thoughts of busineSs, from which he withdrew, at my lord’s particular desire.
The approach of winter brought theSe now happy pairs, Sir George and Lady Wallace, Mr. Wallace and Lady Frances, to London.
They were accompanied by the earl and Eleonora, for whom Lady Frances renewed all her former friendship, adding to it all the affedlion of a Sister.
As they Sometimes frequented the" places of public diversion, to which they commonly went in a party by, themfelves, Sir Robert MonSon, who w^as a gay man for his age, often met them accidentally ; and being known*
to the Earl of T--, was a Surprised

to Wallace, and upon finding that he was really related to Sir George, and that he was of an ancient and honourable family, who had met with miS-fortunes, and had been consequently negledled by the world; but who had by their integrity and indefatigable diligence, raiSed themSelves again. Sir Robert began to be Sorry for having been So rough : finding alSo, that nothing could wean his Son from his attachment to Eleonora, he strove to repair all that was pash He, therefore, now fought every opportunity to join them, and of paying common-place compsiments to MiSs Wallace; panegyrics upon her person, and encomiums upon her a^re-mens ; to which she always replied with a modest and becoming dignity.
As to Wallace, he was only cooly civil to Sir Robert; but the propriety
Mr. WALLACE. 157 ty of his condud Soon prompted the old baronet to come to amicable terms. Numerous were the traps v/hich he laid to engage Wallace to Speak a Second time upon a Subjed to which he was now willing to listen; but they were not attended with the v/ished-for SucceSs and the whole family, were piqued at his pride to So great a degree, that he was, at length, tempted to make advantageous propoHs him-felf; pretending, however, thaKhe made them entirely to promote hi’s Son’s happineSs; fearful, from the littleneSs of his mind, that his conSe-quence should be lessened by his con* deScenSion.
Young MonSon, having earnestly desired that the propoSals of his fa^-^ ther might be assented to, Wallace, who loved his sister, began to listen to them.
At that jundure, MiSs Myers, who had by Some means insinuated herSelf among the females of Sir Kobert’s
family,
T5 8' The H'f s t o Ry oV'^
family, and who died with envy to See Eleonora in a probable way of Surpassing her both in Splendor and felicity, while she herSelf could per-Suade no man to take Such a Serpent to his boSom, strove, by every art she was mistreSs of, to inflame the lady and daughter of Sir Robert against the innocent Eleonora.
In order to render Eleonora completely obnoxious, she Scrupled not, in the malevolence of her heart, to declare, that her brother, finding that she caufed So many disputes between him and his wife, from the turbulence of her temper, had been obliged to fend her home to her father ; adding, that “ to be fure she must be of a very
strange disposition, indeed, who-“ could not live quiet with the late « Mrs. Wallace.’’
TheSe malicious stories being circulated in Sir Robert’s hearing, he was So irritated against his Son for liking Such a woman, that he loudly related
alL
Mr. WALLACE. i^g
all the abuSe which he had heard;,; and, by So doing, gave him a very fair opportunity to contradidt all which the envious MiSs Myers had,, with a matchleSs malignity, roundly asserted.
MonSon, having brought over Lady Wallace and Sir George to his party, eastly convinced Sir Robert that he had. been groSsly impofed upon; and he immediately drove away IN^iSs Myers from his houSe; who, having played? the Same.infernal game in almost every family into which she had been admitted, found, at length, that no creature would have any connedlions with her.
MiSs Myers was left by her relations without a Sufficient Subsistence; and as she was both too proud and too lazy to increaSe her little by industry, would •^shave been destitute of the necessaries of life, when she had, by the vileneSs of her behaviour, forfeited the pro-. tedion of her friends, if the humane

Eleonora, who, Soon after her removal from Sir Robert’s houSe, became Mrs. MonSon, had not, on hearing of her distreSs, Settled, tho’ without her knowledge to whom she was obliged, an annuity upon her; to which the amiable Lady Wallace, who was ever Supremely happy with Sir George, generoListy contributed.
Lady Wallace and Lady Frances Soon contradbed a friendship, in which their dear Eleonora had a considerable share.
The three gentlemen were no leSs attached to each other, and, by agreement, Spent the Summer at their re^ Spedlive houSes by turns, and at the Seat of the earl.. They would have gladly engaged Dr. Wallace and. MiSs Nancy; but the ill health of the latter would not permit them to accompany them, in their pleaSurable parties.

Mr. WALLACE. i6i
Wallace gave So much concern to Lady Frances, who had always a particular affedlion for her, that she urged Mr. Wallace to perSuade her father to try what effedl the air and waters of the German Spa would have upon her, as she had herSelf found them very Salutary.
Wallace accordingly availed him-Self of the hint which Lady Frances had dropped, and endeavoured to make his father Sensible of the propriety of his vrife^s propoSal.
Th@ dodor heard him with patience; but neither he, nor Mrs. Wallace, nor Nancy, could be perSuaded to leave people So extremely dear to them.
Lady Frances, from her great af-fedion for the family of her amiable Mr. V'/allace, in order to remove their objedions. Said, that if he would accompany them, and if her father would
be

be of the party, she should like Sucff a tour extremely.
The ever obliging, and So greatly obliged Wallace instantly declared his compliance, and the earl readily gave his assent.
Sir George alSo, and Lady Wallace, expressed a desire to be of the party.
Leaving, therefore, Mrs. MonSon and little George Wallace under the care of her and her affedlionate huS-, band, they Set off for the continent.
As Soon as they arrived at the Spa,^ they met with a Mr. and Mrs. Murden, with their Son, who made their appearance there with the Same views.^
y
Mrs. Murcten, having been a near neighbour to Dr. Wallace, had been accustomed to Send for him when any ©f the family were ill; but, upon the
Setting.,
Mr. WALLACE. 1^3
Setting up of the new pradlitioner in physic, mentioned in the beginning of this history, near them, she had been drawn in, by his plausible behaviour, and appearance ot extraordinary Sagacity, though he was a man of very Superficial parts, to diScard Dr. Wallace, and to take his prescriptions; which had So bad an effedt upon her constitution, that she was obliged to come to London for better advice, being ashamed to return to her old physician, after having uSed him in So unhandibme a manner.
The medicines which her new dodor had poured in upon her, according to his constant pradice, in order to promote the interest of the apothecaries wherever he came, that they might in return constantly recommend him, had So distempered her whole frame, that, after having consulted the most eminent of the faculty in town, and found herSelF rather worSe than better, she was told
by
164 The His TOR y of
by the last physician whoSe advice SI e Solicited, that she had no chance for a perfect recovery, but by a tour to the Spa. As her Spirits, therefore, began to decreafe, as well as her health, her hushand and Son prevailed; on her to comply with the last prescription ; which was,, they Said, a more agreeable one, at least, and more likely to raiSe her Spirits, tliam any which she had followed..
-1
Mrs. Murden, however, though she had punstually purl tied the regimen recommended to her there, for the restoration of her health, had gained but little ground, when she met with-her old neighbour, Dr. Wallace, at one of the fountains..
She advanced towards him told-him that she was glad to fee him, though she knew not well how to look on him, after the undeferved treatment which he had received from her and, in the most friendly .manner^
congrar-
Mr. WALLACE. 165
congratulated him on the marriage of his Son.
This overture brought on, by degrees, a more intimate conversation. The doTor, who did not now Subsist by the practice of physic, thought that he might, without being guilty of an impertinent officiouSneSs, take the liberty to enquire into the state of her health, as she Seemed to be full of complaints.
/
She appeared to be very much pleaSed with the enquiries which he made about her diSorders ; related all that she had Suffered ; and mentioned all the medicines which she had taken, without receiving the least benefit from them; and, after having very much condemned herSelf for her folly, in leaving a man who had ever been Successful in his pradlice, for one who was almost a stranger to her, declared, that she could not, without confusion, alk his advice again; but added, that if he would bury what was past in
oblivion.
i6S The HisTORy of
oblivion, and give it freely to her, she should think herSeJf under great obligations to him.
I
The humane physician replied, that he should look upon himSelf in a very low light, indeed, were he capable of withholding his assistance from any body, elpecially from an old friend and neighbour, who, doubtlefs, imagined that she was adling agreeably to reaSon, when she had recourSe to new advice about her indispositions ; that as health was So truly estimable, and So often precarious, he could not blame any perSons for endeavouring to procure it by methods which induced them to believe that they might be probably attended with fucceSs. He condluded with faying, that he was very Sorry she had been So long deprived of So inestimable a blessing ; that he would consider her caSe ; and that he hoped he should be fortunate in his prescriptions.
He
Mr. WALLACE. iffy
He ordered Something for her immediately, which luckily happened to be efficacious, far beyond his ex-pedlations; for in a few weeks, her health was perfedlly restored.
The recovery of her health, after So long a deprivation of it, and after having Swallowed Such a load, of phySic to no purpoSe, gave Mrs. Murden st> much Satisfadion, that both she and Mr. Murden quite oppressed the dodor with their civilities; and repeatedly affured him, that they would make it their first buSineSs, on their return to England, to restore him to the good opinion of all thoSe who had deSef ted him cruelly, for the fake of his Superficial antagonist.
TheSe assurances from Mr. and Mrs. Murden were truly Sincere when they were delivered, but an unexpeded event gave a flight wound to the intimacy which was renewed between them and the dodor.
MiSs
i68 The HisTORy of
MiSs Wallace, the now only unmarried female of that family, found So much benefit from her tour, and from the constant uSe of the waters, to the efficacy of which the regard and attention of her amiable sister Lady Frances, and the variety of new objedlS, not a little, perhaps, contributed, that she recovered her strength and Spirits apace; the sickly pale-neSs which had for a long time pver-Spread her face, otherwiSe a very agreeable one, gave way to all the bloom of returning health : with that health alSo her vivacity returned, and she appeared So amiable in her perSon, and to be poffeffed of So Sweet a disposition, that young Murden, from looking on her only at first as an entertaining acc]uaintance, began to feel Sentiments of a Softer nature for her; which, as he freely encouraged them, crrew far too violent to be controlled.

In this Situation, he only concealed his passion, by not declaring it with

the assistance of language ; for it was eaSily to be Seen, in every featu‘e of his face, by whom he had been robbed of his heart,
MiSs V/allace, not having vanity enough to imagine that his civilities had more meaning in them, than the little gallantries common among young people of different Sexes v/ho are pretty often together, received his polite attentions about her with the greatest eaSe and good-liumour; and thought, indeed, that, as an invalid, she had Some pretensions to them.
By that eaSe, however, and that good-nature in her behaviour, Tvlurden v/as animated to proceed, till, from the particularity oS his carriage, he Sometimes called up blushes in her cheeks, and drew the eyes of thoSe who were in their company upon them, eSpe- , daily the eyes of Mr. and Mrs. Mtir-den, who did not, in the opinion cf MiSs Wallace, Seem to be pleaSed

with their Son’s attachment to her : one day, therefore, when he was un-uSually assiduous, she begged him, but With great mildneSs of Speech, to leave her, and to offer his civilities to the other ladies preSent.
The young gentleman started at this request, and, with a look which plainly discovered disappointment and regret at not having his politeneSs accepted of in the manner he wished, Said, “ Are, then, m.y affiduities diS-‘‘ agreeable to you, MiSs Wallace
As this question was uttered in a tone as if he should be greatly hurt to find them So, and as his good qualities, together wnth his conftant and public partiality for her, had made a Imall impreffion upon her, she replied ;
“ No, sir; but they may be, possi-‘‘ bly, not agreeable to Mr. and Mrs.
Murden.”
As

As Soon as theSe words had fallen from her lips, she was shocked at the impropriety of them ; and, by blushing extremely for the fault which she had, according to her own feelings, committed, made Such an addition to the number of graces which adorned her countenance, that he determined to do, at that moment, what he had not before absolutely reSolved on.
In conSequence of this Sudden determination, he made a short, but full and very tender confession of his Sentiments ; a confession, which if she , had been Sure of the conSent of his family, would have given her much more pleafure ; she discovered, however, no anger, but a great deal ot confusion.
“ If you are Serious, sir,” Said she, when she could find words ready for utterance, “ I am much obliged to “ you for the favourable opinion “ which you entertain of me; but
I am, notwithstanding, almost in-I 2	“ dined
ly-2 The Historv of
dined to wish that you was not Serious, as I fear that your Send-ments, with regard to me, will not “ be approved of by thoSe who have a right, and who exped to be consulted about your choice.”
“IS you will promiSe, MiSs Wal-“ lace,” replied he, “ that my love “ shall meet with no other objedion, “ I will undertake to Settle every thing “ to your Satisfadion.”
A tacit acquiescence was ail that he could obtain from her.
He went to communicate his feelings to his father, and she went upon a similar errand to hers.
With her father, MiSs Wallace found her mother, her brother, and Laciy Frances: she should ad, she thought, very improperly, inconcealing — from them what had passed between her and young Murden, tho’ she did not exped any thing from his prepossessions
Mr. WALLACE. 173
possessions in her favour, and therefore opened her heart without the least reServe.
As they all approved of the cha-radler and manners of young Murden, they Sincerely wished that his family might make no objcdlion to his choice.
/
Poor Nancy, who now began to be Serioussy interested in his SucceSs, . waited for his return with a palpitation of her heart, which was only perceived by Lady Frances.
Murden Soon re-appeared, but with a dejedion in his air, which left her but few hopes to keep flattery alive. The SmallneSs of her fortune, he told her (v/ith tears in his eyes), was the only reaSon which his father and mother had given for not com.plying with his wishes ; having informed him, that, with the Settlement they should make on him during their
I 3	fives.
174 The HisTORy of
lives, he could not Support a family in a tolerable manner.
Cn the communication of this intelligence, heart breaking as it was. Mils Wallace, with the greatest fortitude, not only gave np» all thoughts of being happy with her lover, but itudiouiiy employed herSelf in administering conSoiation to him ; and then desired him not to Seek any farther opportunities to iee her, as, by So doing, he would only increaSe their mutual uneasineSs.
He heard her; but Seemed So loth to return an anSwer to what fne had Said, that she was obliged to make ,	‘
uSe of her most preffing intreaties and by thoSe intreaties appeared, though innocently, to interest herSelf So much in his happineSs, that she added new fuel to the fiames of love, which she had already railed in his boSom : she could, in short, by no arguments nor Solicitations prevail on
him
Mr. WALLACE. iy5
him to relinquish his pretensions to her.
Just at that critical instant, Lady Frances, not knowing that they were together. Surprized them.
Plainly discovering their dIstreSs, she quitted them instantly, without articulatincr a Sincle word, and flew to her hushand. To him she related what Sne had obServed, and with her lovely eyes moistened with Sympathetic tears, she intreated him to grant her request, and to make the addition to Nancy’s fortune which Mr. Murden might reasonably expedl, if he would, inconsequence of it, conSent to her becoming his daughter.
Wallace, struck with the tender generosity of her behaviour. So diametrically opposite to that of his first wife, adored her for it, and was ready to devour her with fondneSs ; he claSp-cd her to his grateful boSom with a
I 4	prdTurc
lyo 1 he iTisTORy of
preffure which very forcibly proved the fervor of his love.
The unexpe£led demand, and the charming manner with v/hich it was conveyed, deprived him for Some time of the powers of Speech : his tongue was chained tip : he was dumb*
Words at last found a passage; though he, over and over again, declared, that he could not find words Sufficiently expressive to deScribe her excellence, or his own lively SenSe of it. ‘‘ I have nothing to do,” continued he, lifting up his eyes, “ but to “ admire, and to obey.”
Upon the dodor’s entrance, he, in the moSt affedionate terms, enlarged on his Fanny’s generoSity and affection.
The good old man, while the tears of parental fondneSs stowed fast down his venerable cheeks, Said, with
a rap-

a rapturous elevation of his voice,
“ Did I not Say, my dear George,.
“ that she was an angel come to bids “ us all V
Lady Frances, to change the Scene, which grew too pathetic to be Supported by herSelf, and with which, she thought, they were too much af-feded, Said to the doDor, addressing herSelf to him with the mast winnine; Imile, ‘‘ Come, my dear Sir, let me “ perluade you to go and tell Mr.
“ Murden what he may expedt with
my sister.”
The doftor left her, raising up his eyes and hands, full of admiration, while Wallace gazed on her in ecstatic Silence, as if she was a Superior being.
When VSallace told the earl, who then joined them, what had been the Subjedt of their conversation, he very • much commended his daughter, for iiavingendeayoured to procure a Settle- ,
I 5	ment
5^8 The HisTORy of ment for MiSs Wallace So agreeable to her, and generoufiy offered to Supply Wallace with any Sum for which he might have occasion.
“ Gracious Heaven!” cried Wallace, throwing up his eyes, in which the tears stood trembling. So much was he. affected by the nobleneSs of
Lord T-------’s behaviour, and by the
equally heroic carriage of Lady Frances, “ give me merit to deServe this “ excellent, this lovely creature, and “ enable me to return the obligations “ which I am already under to you,. “ my lord, for having bestowed her on me ; I alk no more.”
‘‘ My dear Son,” replied the earl, quite moved with the effusions of his grateful heart, “ you more than repay “ m»e, by your tenderneSs to my ami-“ able girl.”
^ The do6lor, when he left his Son and daughter, considered, that as Murden had never applied to him,
it
Mr. WALLACE. 179
it would be better to inform his daughter of what her oood Sister had
O	O
propoSed to do for her.
While he was So considering!:, the young gentleman, who had torn him-Self from her with the utmost reluctance and regret, returned to tell her, that he would make another attempt to Soften his father’s inflexibility; and that he would try to learn from him what he intended to give up to him ; being affured, that she had been thoroughly instructed by her exemplary mother, in all kinds of ceconomical knowledge; adding, that though site deServed more, becauSe she was an ceconomist, Siie could make the leSs do, till Something turned out in their favour.
Finding her melted into tears, he eagerly afked the cauSe of them.
Being told that they flowed from her receding upon her amiable Sister’s. kindaeSs to her, he flew to his father,

and his first v/ords v/ere, “ What a lovely creature is Lady Frances st*
“ How, Charles!” Said Mr. Mur-den, ‘‘ Have you changed the objedt “ of your passion So Soon Lady Frances Wallace will, I fancy, be more uncomeatable than Mist “ Nancy ; and I should abhor mySelf “ for harbouring any designs upon a “ woman So diScrcet, So amiable as “ she is, and So happy in her huS-band.'’
“ No, fir,” replied Charles, I P harbour no improper designs ; but “ by her interposition, I m.ay become, “ related to her, if you will conde-“ Scend to hear me with patience.”
“ Well, then,” Said the old gentleman, “ let us hear how you will bring yourSelf off.”
Charles then told his father what he had heard from Mist Wallace; and be consented to the match, if they

would only advance two thoufand pounds more to the fortune which her brother had already given to her.
TheSe conditions were most chear-fully agreed to, as Soon as they were made known.
In a short time afterwards they all returned to England ; and the young people-were married, with the entire approbation of their parents on both sides ; and went to live in a pleaSant little village, between that wherein. the dodlor dwelt, and the place where the elder Mr. Murden’s estate lay.
Mr. Mnrden, when he returned to the North, did not forget the promiSe which he made at the Spa ; he, with true pleafure, related every where the prodigious benefit which his wife had received from the prescriptions of Dr. Wallace, and, with equal pleafure, expatiated upon the noble behaviour of his Son and Lady Frances.

All the dodlor’s patients, v:ho had deSerted him, flocked to him again ; So that he had Soon more pradtice than he could w'ell attend to, and was Soon in a condition to offer to refund the two thouSand pounds which Wallace had advanced to forward the marriage of his sister; but neither he nor Lady Frances would receive a farthing ofthatSum ; they only desired, as the rest of his children wTre amply provided for, that he would reServe it for his daughter Nancy.
