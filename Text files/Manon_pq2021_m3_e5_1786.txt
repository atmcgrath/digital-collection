TRANSLATOR’S PREFACE.
ft
TN the long winter of 1784, which I ^ pajfed in JSlormandy, this little Novel fell into my hands. I had then with me foms Englifb friends who did not re. I French j and for their amufement I tranflated as I ready the moji ftriking pajfages of the fiery; which appeared to them fo interejiing that 1 was induced to tranjlate the whole-, or rather to write it anew in Englifh.
I do not pretend to have adhered very dofely to a maxim I have fomewhere feen^ that '^fidelity is the firfi duty of a tranJlatorf\ Tfound the Jhort fentences of the original., f dofely copied, would he fo very unpleafant to an Englijh ear, that I have throughout lengthened the periods, and have in one or
two
PM infiances tranfpofed a whole pagep where I thought I could make 'the narrative- ^
more conneded or more clear, -.
\
Reflexions and exclamations^ often tritef \ and too frequently repeated, I have’ either altered or entirely omitted but the cX\s\o^2iriX. ■ of the French .is- fiill very vijihle: the* perhaps it is- more charaXerifiical of the man- -ners of the nation where the event happened^ , than pre^ idicial to thefiyle>, .
It has been thought, that notwithfianding ’ * all her errors and failings, the piXure of < Ma-non is too captivating, and thai vice is not drawn in her charaXer as fufiiciently odious. But furely an improper tendency -cannot be imputed to a fiory where every deviation from virtue immediately, and fe- -verely punifhed, and which is at length clofed ■ by a catafirophe fo melancholy as the aeath of Manon,. and the remorfe and defpair of j her lover,

Returning from Rouen, whither
fome law bufinefs in which I a£ted for my daughter had carried me, I took the road by Evreux, where I relied the firfl:
night, and about noon the next day I found myfelf near Pafiy.
%
On entering that little town, 1 was fur-prifed with the appearance of unufual buftle among the inhabitants, who were running from their^ houfes, and gathering in crouds round the gate of a mean inn, where flood

two covered waggons; the horfes of which, almoft exhaufted with fatigue and heat, feemed to be but juft arrived from a long . journey. I flopped to enquire whence all this buflle proceeded, but could gain no information : the people, eager to gratify their own curiolity, had not time to attend to mine. They continued prefling into the inn yard, where I at length faw a fbldier, to whom 1 beckoned, and on his coming up to me, defired to know what all this con-fufion meant ? O nothing Sir, faid he j nothing but ten or twelve girls of the town, whom we are carrying to Havre de Grace, from whence they are to be tranfported to America: fome of them are pretty, which I fuppofe excites the attention of thefe peo-
I
. pie.
%
I was palling on after having received this information •, but my attention was further excited by a woman whom I faw com-

ing out of the inn, wringing her hands, and
4
bearing on her countenance the impreffions of horror and pity, whilft (he exclaimed againft the cruelty of the fcene Ihe had been witnefs to. What is it then, faid I ?—Ah !
Sir, replied the woman, go in yourfelf, and judge whether fuch a fight is not enough to pierce one’s heart. I left my horfej and with difficulty making my way through the croud, I sot irvto the room whiiher thefe poor creatures were carried, and where I was indeed ftruck with a moft affeding fpedacle.
Among the unfortunate women, who were chained together, fix in each divifion,’ by a chain paffing round the body, there was one whofe air and figure feemed fo little to correfpond with the fituation ffie was in, ^ that had I feen her in any other place I ffiould have concluded her to have been a young woman of the firfi: falhion. Such
B 2	was
i_....	^

"Was the beauty and elegance of her face and form, that neither the deep deprcfllon fhe appeared to be under, nor the dirt and dufi: with which Ihe was cover’d, could conceal it *, and ihe infpir’d me at once with pity and refpedt. While Ihe turn’d from the gaze of vulgar curiofity as much as her chain would admit, there was in her countenance and attitude fuch an air of dignity and mo-defty, that it was difficult to believe ffie could ever have deferv’d the terrible pu-niffiment under which ffie wasv ffifferino-1
O *
jm
and the expreffion of gri^r and terror im-preffed on features, delicate, regular and animated, made her the mold interefting figure I had ever feen.
The fix foldiers who guarded thefe urn ^ happy viflims were in the room. I took - afide the commander of the party, and alk’d him what he knew of that beautiful young icreature ? We took her from the hofpital,
Sir,
Sir, faid he, with the others •, probably flie was not fent thither for her good deferts.
I have often queftioned her on the road, but fhe continues filent. However, though I have received no particular orders to favor her, I cannot help treating her rather better than the red', as fhe leems to me to be fomething above them. The young man who fits there, continued he, pointing to another part of the room, can perhaps give you the information you defire: he has followed her from Paris, weeping over her the whole way, and muft certainly be her brother or her lover,
I turned towards the place he had fhewn me, and beheld, fitting on the feat of a window, a young man who feemed loft in the contemplation of his own mifery. It is # impolTible to conceive a more lively image of defpair. His drefs was plain, and even negleded j but the moment I faw him I
B 3	knew
«
t
knew he was a man of faikion and education. I approached the place where he fat; he arofe •, and in his figure, his air, his eyes, and the expreflion of his countenance, there was fomethino; at once fo commandino- and
O	O
infinuating, that I felt myfelf immediately and involuntarily difpofed to love and ferve him. Do not let my intrufion difturbyou, Sir, faid T, fitting down by him; but will you be fo good as to fatisfy a curiofity I cannot reprels, to knov\T who that very lovely young creature is who fee'ms to belong to a rank fo different from that in which I I'ee her ? Ah ! Sir, re-' plied he, I cannot inform you who fhe is, without telling you alfo who I am, which very ftrong reafons make me wifii to conceal. One circumftance, however, you may probably have learned from thofe fellows, continued he, (pointing to the foldiers) which is, that I love her with the moft vio-lent pafiion, and that her fituation makes me the moft miferable of men. Before fiie

came from Paris, I vainly tried every expedient to procure her liberty. Solicitations and addrefs failing, I had recourfe to force; but that has been equally unfuccefsfull; and I am condenined to fee her dragg’d like a criminal to America. I have only one part to take, which is that of following and embarking with her ; which I am determined to do.
\
But thofe inhuman wretches. Sir, (meaning the guard) will not fuffer me now to approach her. My dehgn was, (for why fhould I conceal it) to attack them openly with fire arms, at fome leagues diftance from Paris; and I had by a confiderable fum of money hired four men to aflifl: me; but the traitors no fooner faw me engaged, than they went off with my money, and as it would then have been vain to contend with fix well armed, foldiers, I gave up my pif-tols, and propofed that they ftiould fuffer
B 4	me

me to follow the waggons, for which per-milTion I promifed to pay them handfomely. Tempted by that offer, they allowed me to accompany them j but I foon found they would be paid every time they gave me leave to fpeak to my unfortunate miftrefs : my purfe was confequently foon exhaufled, and now that I have nothing left, they drive me back with the moft brutal menaces, whenever I would approach her. Juft before you came in, I attempted, notwith-ftanding their threats, to fpeak to her, when one of them had the infolence to drive me back with his bayonet, and on my re-preaching him, to level his piece at me.

It is not, Sir, faid he confufedly, it is not that we refufe to let the young man fpeak to the perfon he defires to be with, but only he wanted to be always near her, which is very inconvenient to us; therefore it is but jull he Ihould pay us for that inconvenience Well then, faid I, let us fee at how much you value the indulgence ? He had
J
the effrontery to afk me two Louis, which I gave him immediately; aflliring him at the fame timei that I had given my diredion to the young man, who would not fail to inform me if he broke his agreement, or otherwife mifbehaved j and that I well knew in that cafe how to have him punilhed.

The lively and exprefllve terms in which’. the unfortunate ftranger afllired me of his
gratitude, convinced me he deferved all I

had done for him. As I paffed out I fpoke a few v^ords to his miftrefs, who anfwered me with fuch an enchanting modefty, that I left the room deeply refledling on the extraordinary and incomprehenfible charaders,
of women.-
R eturning again to my folitude, I heard no more of thefe unhappy young people ; and near two years having palled fince I met them, the impreffion they had made on my mind was almoft effaced, when chance again brought them to my recolledion, and fur-nifhed me with the means of hearing the whole of their difaftrous hiftory.
Landing at Calais, in my way from London, I was detained there by I know not what circumftancej that day and the following
\
lowing nignt. As i palled through the ilreet about noon, I thought I faw the fame young man whom I had met tvvoyears before at Pafly. He had an old portmanteau under his arm, and appeared to be juft come on ihore: his drefs was mean, and he was much paler and thinner than when I firft faw him, but the uncommon elegance of his perfon, and the turn of his countenance, faded as it was, left me no reafon to doubt he was the fame. I fpoke to him : he immediately recolledled me, with expreffions of joy and affedlion not to be defcribed.
•i
Ah, my dear Sir 1 cried he, have I then once more an opportunity of aflltring you of my eternal gratitude. 1- enquired from whence he came ? By fea from Havre, replied he, where I lately landed from America. Alafs ! my poor friend, faid I, you do not feem to have returned in a very fortunate fituation. Go, continued I, to le

Lion d*Or; I will come to you there pre-fently. I foon rejoined him, impatient to have an account of his misfortunes, and of the circumftances of his voyage, which he. now no longer hefitated to give me. You have behaved fo nobly to me. Sir, faid he, that it would be the bafefl: ingratitude to conceal any thing from you. Yes, you fhall now have at once the hi dory of my misfortunes, and of the indifcretions, the fhameful weaknefs, which has brought thefe misfortunes upon me. While your reafon obliges you to condemn me, I know, from the goodnefs of your heart, I lhall ftill have your pity.
Here then begins the pathetic recital of my young friend’s unhappy fortune. I put it upon paper immediately after having heard it; therefore my narrative is ex ad, tho I am fenfible it will be much lefs intC’ reding to thofe who not having leen him

The Hiftory of the Chevalier des Grieux and Manpn de L'Efcauti
#
yi T the age of feventeen I had com--jr\. pleated my ftudies at Amiens, whither my parents, who are of one of the firft families in Picardy, had fent me.
My condu6t and manners there had been fo well regulated, I had obtained fo high a character for fobriety and application, that I was by the mailers propofed as an example to the college. Nor did this coll me any great efforts: born with a difpoli-tion naturally mild and tranquil, my inclination led me to books, rather than to the turbulent amufements of lads of my age j and the marks of averfion I had fhewn to aftual vice, had given me the credit of having an iinconamon fliare of virtue.
“ ' My
I
My high birth, my apparent rpplication, and Lme ex.crior advantages which I poiiHTed, had recommended me to the i notice and favor of the principal people j of the place.
I had finilhed my exercifes with fo general an approbation, that the Bhliop of the diocefs, who was prefent at the exhibition of the College, propoied to me the ecclefiaftical line, as a road in which I Ihoiild rife to quicker and higher preferment than any I could hope tor in the order of Malta, for which my parents defigned me, and in purfuance of which ' defign I already wore the crofs of the order, with the name of the Chevalier des Grieux. The College vacation being come, I prepared to return home; my father intending to fend me foon afterwards to finifh my education at an Academy at Paris.
I had

I had now fixed the day for my departure from Amiens. Happy had it been for me if I had gone one day fooner : I fliould then have avoided the fight of that dangerous beauty, to my paflion for whom , I owe all the miferies that have purfued me thro’ life, and have plunged me at length into the deepeft gulph of defpair.
I regretted nothing in leaving the college but being feparated from a friend, with whom, during my ftay there, I had contradled the clofeft intimacy. We had gone thro’ a courfe of ftudies together; but tho’ he was fome years older than myfelf, he was to continue longer at College, becaufe the fmall fortune he was likely to inherit from his family was not enough to fnpport him in any other pro-fefiion than that of a churchman, for which he was therefore defigned : and the
acquificions
\
acquificions neceflary for that profeffion required a longer attendance.
I
In the coiirfe of my narrative you will remark that this beloved friend pof-fefled every good quality that can dignify human nature, with fo pure and exalted an attachment to me, as furpaifes the mod: celebrated examples of antiquity^ If I had followed his advice 1 had been happy! ' Or if after my firft error, I had not fhut my ears againfthis admonitions, as v;ell as againft the voice of my own reafon, I Ihould St lead: have faved fomething, from the wreck of my fortune and my reputation. Alas! in return for his friendfhip I treated • him with coldnefs and ingratitude, and flew from him as a troublefome monitor whofe advice was an aftfont to my under-ftanding,

On the evening of the day which was> to be the lafl: of my flay at Amiens, I
was
%
was walking through the ftreet with this friend, whofe name was Tiberge, when the ftage coach from Arras drove into the yard of an inn near which we happened to be •, we fauntered in in the idle way of people who have nothing to do, and we faw feveral women get out of the coach, who went immediately into the houfe*, but one remained (landing by the coach door, while a man, fifty or fixty years old, who feemed to have the care of her, was taking her baggage out of the boot.' This young woman, who could not be more than fifteen, immediately attraded my attention. So uncommon was her beauty, that I, (who had never made any obfervation on beauty till then, and had fben the prettied women without • being at all affeded by their charms,) was immediately (truck with it to a degree that appeared like the effed of fafcination. That fobriety and deady
condud
«•
/
conduct for which I had gained fo much applaufe, vanifhed in a moment. The timidity which I had before been remarked for, even to a degree of ridicule, was gone I knew not how. I went up to the lovely creature, who was already miftrefs of my heart, and afked her what was the fortunate occafion of bringing her to Amiens, and what acquaintance Ihe had there ? She anfwered me ingenu-OLiily in a few words, that fhe was fent thither by her parents to go into a convent j it being their intention to make her a nun. I was enlightened enough by my infant paffion to know that this refolution would be the death of my new formed hopes. I fpoke to her in a way which gave her fufiicient intimation of my fen-timents. Though fhe was younger than myfelf, I found her infinitely better informed i and probably it was her early maturity, and her violent inclination for
gaiety
gaiety ana pieaiure, rnai: naa aeuerminea ner parents to fecure her from the confequences of fuch propenfities.—Fatal propenfities ! which have ruined both her and myfelf.
Entering into dirGourCe with her, I exclaimed againfl: the barbarous intentions of her friends, and. argued with all the pedan--tic eloquence I had acquired at college. She affefted neither referve or difdain, but told me, fimply and naturally, that flie fore-faw all the unhappinefs Ihe was to fuffer in a Hate of life for which Ihe had not the leaft difpofition, but that fhe muft fubmit becaufe it appeared to be the will of Heaven, which had given her- no means of avoiding it. The penfive foftnefs of her countenance, and the melancholy mufic of her voice, while Ihe pronounced thefe words, or rather the afcendancy of my evil def-tiny, which had feized me to drag me down to my undoing, prevailed fo far on
my
N
my intoxicated fenfes, that I was no longer mailer of myfelf. Without reflefting one moment on what I was about, to fay, I af-fured her that if flie would rely on my honor, and on the extreme paffion with which fhe had infpired me, I would from that moment dedicate my whole life to her lervice, deliver her from the tyranny of her relations, and place all my happinefs in
procuring her’s. I added every thing that
0
I thought likely to induce her to put her-felf inftantly under my protedlion. My beautiful unknown was well aware that at my age deceit was little to be apprehended, and fhe did not hefitate long between the profpedl of affluence and pleafurc I offered her, and the gloom of a convent. She told me that if Ihe faw the lead: probability of my refcuing her from a fate fhe ab-horred, fhe could not refufe to hearken to my profeffions, and fhould think herfelf
happy
*
/
I
happy to owe to me a iioerty wnich me valued more than life. '
I repeated to her that I v/as ready to undertake every thing: but having no knowledge of the world, nor any idea of the ma-
\
nagement necelTary for an intrigue, I con-
4
tinned to run on in the warm expreffions of love, when her old conduflor returned j and our conference was on the point of ending very little to either her fatisfadlion or mine, if the readinefs of her invention had not found a remedy for the ftupidity with which his unwelcome arrival had ftruck me. Without being the leaft difconcerted, fhe continued talking to me-, and addreffing me by the name of her coufin, told me that fince lire was fortunate enough to meet me at Amiens, fhe would delay her entrance into the convent till the next day, that me might have the pleafure of fupping with me that evening, in compliance with my invitation. 1 immediately

I
man, but had long fince been fettled at| Amiens by his bounty; a man whom I knew to be entirely devoted to my fervice.
I condudted her thither myfelf; while the old fervant, who Teemed but little pleafed with this new acquaintance which his charge had made, followed us with a difeontented countenance; and my friend Tiberge, who was very much amazed at the whole feene, walked by in profound filence. He had not heard the fubjedt of our difeourfe, having fauntered backward and forward in the inn yard during this fhort converfation, in which I was gone a whole age in love; and I knew too much of his difpofition, not to be aware that I could hope for no indulgence from him in the mad projedt I had undertaken; neither did I believe he 1
would even be a quiet fpedlator. There-1

I

\
colleft fomcthing I had negle^led, which I told him muft be done before I departed the next morning •, and he undertook the commiiTion, though he faw my motive
for giving it to him.
«
I then found myfelf at liberty to fay to my charming miftrefs all that the moft unbounded paffion could didate 5 and never perhaps were tranfports greater than mine. My fair unknown told me her name was Mademoifelle Manon L’El-caut. She appeared flattered by the fuc-cefs of her charms, and confefied that fhe thought me very aimable, and that fhe lliould be'happy to give up to me that liberty which but for my attachment muft have been loft in the terrors of perpetual confinement. She enquired of what family C wasand being herfelf born in an inferior rank,

of life, was hot a little elated to hear that the perfon who was become her have was of fo confiderable a family.
We now began to confider what we fhould do to prevent our being parted; and after various plans, that of immediately eloping feemed the only feafible one. Though the man who , attended her w'as only a fervant, it required great management either to get him out of the way or efcape from him: we therefore agreed to have a chaife ready before he ihould be awake in the morning, and go diredtly to Paris^ where we intended to be immediately married; I had about fifty crowns by me5 (as my father gave me a very handfome allowance, which, having few expences, I never exceeded) my miflrefs had about double that fuiu; to pay the charges of her initiation into the Convents and we thought, like two
children
children as we were, that an hundred and fifty crowns were an inexhauftible fumi and we depended as much on a fupport after our elopement, as we did that our fcheme to get away would fucceed. Hav>» ing flipped with my charming Manon, with a degree of gaiety and fatisfadtion I had never before felt, I went home to prepare for the morning.
My arrangements were the more eafily made, bccaufe having before defigned to quit Amiens the next day, my baggage was already packed up, and I found no difficulty in getting it carried to the inn, nor in fecuring a chaife to be ready at five o’clock in the morning, which was as foon as the gates of the town were opened. But I had yet an obftacle to fur-mount to which I had not fufficiently attended, but which had nearly rendered my whole defign abortive*
C 2	My
N
My friend Tiberge, though only three years older than myfelf, was of the moft regulated condufl and ftricteft moralsj and his warm attachment to me made him very quick fighted in Whatever related to me,
i
The converfation I had held with fo beautiful a girl as Manon, and my olfi-cioLifly conducing her to another inn, as well as the finefie by which I had contrived to difmifs him from the party, had given him fufficient reafon to fufped me; but unwilling to offend me, he would not return to the place where he had kfi us together, but waited for me at my lodgings, where I found him on my return.
I was out of humour when I faw him, which he eafily perceived j for I found it impoffible to conceal the conilraint his prefence laid me under. “ I am fure, my
dear
%
*
^ i
dear Des Grieux,” faid he, “ that you are engaged in fome purfuit which you wifh to conceal from me. I fee it plainly by your manner.’* I anfwered him with fome tart-fiefs, that I did not conceive myfelf obliged to give him an account of my actions. “ No,” returned he,. “ you certainly are not; but you call me your friend, and furely as fuch I am entitled to fome degree of confidence.” In Ihort, he prefied me fo warmly, that I, who had never concealed from him any emotion of my heart, found myfelf unable to refufe him the fecret it now laboured with: I declared to him the violence of my paf-fion, and owned the wild projedl: I had determined on to pofiefs myfelf of the ol> jed of k.
But hardly had this unguarded detail concluded, before I repented of having made it. Tiberge was too fincerely my Jfiend to hear of fuch a fcheme with tem-
^ 3
per; and he received my confefifion with an air fo cold, and a countenance fo dif-contented, that I immediately trembled for the fnccefs of my undertaking; and not without reafon, when he told me that he was determined to oppofe it to the utmoft of his power. Fie reprefented to me in ftrong terms all the folly of what I was about to do ; and concluded by pro-tefting that if I ftill perfifted in hazarding fo ruinous and difgraceful a meafure, he would inform thofe of my defigns who had more power than he pofTefled, effedtually to prevent me.
■ I was half diilradfed that I had fo indif-
✓
cretely betrayed myfelf, well convinced that (what I then thought) his ridiculous prudence would entirely defeat all my well-concerted plans, and feparate me for ever from Manon. However I began to recoiled that in this ill-timed confidence I had
not
not told him that I meant to go off the very next morning; and I determined to deceive him by an equivocation. “ Ti-berge,*’ cried I, “ I always thought you my friend, and by your prcfent condudt you fhew yonrfelf truly fo. I meant only to hear what you would fay to my pro-je<5t: as to executing it diredtiy it is not what I have refolved upon. It is true I am diftrafledly in love with this girl, and find it impoffible to live without her ; but I fhall not be fo rafh as I have made you fuppofc. Neverthelefs as I cannot flatter you with any hopes of curing me of a paf. fion which is at this time a part of my exiftence, I (ball certainly continue to fee her as long and as often as in my power.
For this reafon I fhall delay my return home for a few days. Come to me tomorrow morning; I will carry you with tQ fee her; and when yoii have con-
C 4	verfed
verfed with her, you Ihall own that her charms are fnch as fhall juftify all I can do for her. Tiberge feeing me rather more reafonable, and believing me incapable of deceit, became better fatisfied and left me, not without renewing his good advice.

A
He was no fooner gone, than I fet about fuch preparations as I had yet to make, in which I palTed the remainder of the night; and at the firll dawn of morning I flew to the inn, where Manon ex-peded me. She was already drefled, and waiting at the window which looked into the ftreet, where Ihe no fooner perceived me than fhe defcended in filence to the door, which (he opened herfelf, and giving me a fmall bundle, which eon-tained all the linen flie would take, we left the inn as expeditioufly as poflrble, and found the chaife waiting at the appointed
place,
i -
place. I put Manon into it, and mounting a poft horfe myfelf, we went off with fiich expedition that we were foon at a-great diftance from Amiens^-
The condufl: of my friend Tiberge, when-he found how I had deceived him, you will know hereafter: you will hear with fur-prize theexcefs of his zeal and attachment; and you will feel how unpardonable my conduct muft have been, and how much I muft now fuffer in refleding that I have requited fuch generofity only with the blackeft ingratitude.
V ,
We travelled fo fall that we reached
V
St. Dennis before the evening., clofed; i, indeed we had allowed ourfelves at the different ftages no longer time than fuf-ficed to change horfes, and had therefore had neither converfation nor refrefh-
C 5	ment; •
N
ment: but now, as we faw ourfelves fo near Paris, and out of danger from purfuit, we determined to flop for fome hours, So unguarded was our behaviour, that our hoft and poftillions could not but remark itj and added to our extreme youth, and the hafte we appeared to be in, it gave them fufficient caufe to fuf-pe6t the nature of our connexion and adventures.
Though our project of being married was now forgotten, certain it is, that naturally tender and conftant as I was, I fhould have^ been happy my whole life with Manon had Ihe been but faithful. The fweetnefs of her temper, the foft-nefs of her heart, and the vivacity of her humour, added to the uncommon attractions of her perfon, gave her every hour an encreafed afcendancy over me. My attachment was fo ftrong, that 1 fhould
have
I
^ \
have continued for ever in voluntary flavery, the happieft of mankind. Per-verle and fatal deftiny! Thofe very qualities of' my temper, tendernefs and con-ftancv, which would have fecured the happinefs of any other man, have rendered me the moft miferable being on earth.
On our arrival at Paris, we took a ready furnilhed lodging in la rue de V—, which moll unhappily for me was at that time inhabited by Monfieur de Beau-manoir, a , celebrated Farmer General,
•r	^
t
Three weeks pafled away, in which I was fo entirely engrofled by my paffion that I thought of nothing elfe; but the natural turn of my temper, and the quiet way in which we lived, without company or dilTipation, brought back to my alienated mind the idea of my family, and of the pain my father mull feel from my
C 6	abfenqe
%
I
abfence and the uncertainty of what was become of me.
I determined immediately to make
advances towards a reconciliation with
him j and even flattered myfelf that if I
could prevail on him once to fee IVJanon,
he would be fo captivated with the beauty
of her perfon, and her feducing manners,
that I could eafily perfuade him of what
I myfelf firmly believed, that her heart
' and underftanding were equal to the
graces of her form; in which cafe I was
ilire that her being without fortune, or of
an obfcure family, would not prevent his
confenting to my marrying her: and to
%
marry her was ftill my intention, though 1 was now convinced 1 could not do it for
t
.many years to come if my father oppofed
In France a man cannot marry without the confent of hh ■uu'Ciit"; till lie is 305 and a woman; till ihc is 25 years old.
I coir-
4
^	, V
1
I communicated my refleflions to Manon ; and told her, that befides motives of love towards her, and duty to my father, which influenced me, I had yet another which ought to be of fome weight, and that was neceflity; for our finances were by this time fo very much reduced, that I was .entirely cured of believing them inexhauftible, Manon heard this difcourfe with a coldnefs that quite difconcerted me. She reprefented to me the hazard I ran of being forced away by my father as foon as he knew where I was concealed j and fpoke tenderly of the pain fhe Ihould then feel in being feparated from me. As to the plea of neceflity, Ihe anfwered that we had yet enough to fupport us fome weeks,' and that when our prefent money was gone, file doubted not but that flie Ihould find refources in the kindnefs of fome of
her relations in the country, who fhe was
fure
lure would fupply her as loon as Ihe applied to them. To thefe objedlions, as they feemed to arife from her affedHon for me, and her fears of lofing me, I eafily yielded, and gave up for the pre-fent all thoughts of writmg to my father,
I
This little difference of opinion Ihe foftened by fo many bewitching marks of tendernefs and attachment, that I, who abfolutely adored her, gave myfelf up implicitly to her will, and believed that whatever fhe advifed was right. Intoxicated as I v/as with my extravagant paffion, I dreamed not of the bitter return that was even now preparing for me! Manon had hitherto been my banker, and had entirely managed our little expences; nor had I found any reafon to fufpedl her prudence, till a few days after the converfation I have juft related, I remarked that our table
was
I
9
was better fupplied than ufual, and that Manon had added to her drefs feveral articles of a price and quality, much higher than fhe had before polTefled. As I knew the money remaining in her hands could not exceed twelve or fourteen piftoles, I could not help expreffing my furprife at what I faw : but Manon anfwered that I need be in no pain on that account. “ Did I not tell you,” faid flie, fmiling, “ that I flhould find refourcesl”’ I loved and trufted her with fuch fimple faith that I ^ was not eafily alarmed. I believed fhe might really have received fome affiftance from her relations, and was for that time content.
4
But a few days afterwards I went out after dinner, having told her I fhould be abfent all the evening. Not however finding thofe at home with whom I meant
to
*
$
to have palled it, l returned to my lodgings almoft immediately, and was furprifed, on rapping at the door, that I was made to wdit fev^eral minutes. Our only fervant was a girl of fixteen or feventeen years old : when at length fhe came to-the door,
I afked her why fhe had kept me there fo long ? She anfwered, in apparent confu* lion, that (he had not heard me. It happened that I had rapped only once j I naturally therefore alked her, why if Ihe had not heard me Ihe had opened thC' door at all ?• .This queftion fo totally dif concerted her, that having no prefence of mind to form another excufe, (he burU into tears, aflliring me that it was not her fault, but that her miftrefs had forbidden
her opening the door till fhe fhould hkve'
#
given Monheur de .Beaumanoir time to go away by the other ftaircafe which had a communication with her apartment.
At
»
g
At this explanation, which I received as I was going up ftairs, I became like a ftatue. The furprize I was under was fuch, that not knowing what I did, I came down ftairs again, and pretending to have forgotten fomething, went haftily out of the houfe, bidding the girl tell her mif-trefs that I fhould be back diredlly, but by no means to mention that ftic had told me of her having been vifited by Monfieur de Beaumanoir.
The confternation and diftradtion of my mind deprived me for fome moments of my faculties. I walked along, breath-kfs and ftupid, till I came to a coffee houfe, into which I entered; and fitting down by a table, I threw my arms on it, and laid down my head, trying to deve-lope fentiments of rage, jealoufy and mad-nefs, till then unfelt. Hardly dared I repeat to myfelf the words I had heard,
and
\
and could fcarce perTuade myfelf but that ’ the whole was an illufion. Sometimes I;
4
determined to return home, and to take no notice of what I had heard. So im-pofllble did it appear that Manon could be faithlefs, that even to fuppofe it a moment feemed a crime. Surely, thought I, the fentiments of my own bofom are not better known to me than thofe of Manon. Can that foft temper, that ingenuous countenance, conceal a perfidious and cruel heart ? No ! it is impolTibie ! Manon cannot be fo abandoned!
Still however this vifit of Monfieur de
Beanmanoir was a circumftance not to be
got over: and then the acquifitions Manon
had lately rriade of drefs and ornaments
darted acrofs my brain, and feemed to
confirm the dreadful idea of a newer and
«
a richer lover. The reliance too fhe
¥
feemed to Have on finding refources for
our
our fnpport; from whence could it arlfe but from having fecured to herfelf fome powerful protestor ? On the other hand,
I had hardly been abfent from her ten minutes fince our arrival at Paris: what opportunity therefore could Manon have had to liften to the addreffes of any other man ? At length I perfuaded myfelf that I had' difcovered the reafon of this myfte-rious condud, Monfieur de Beaumanoir, faid I, is a man of great bufinefs and con-nedions: probably the relations of Manon may thro’ his hands have remitted her part of the money fhe hoped to receive from' them •, and to-day he may have brought her another fupply, which fhe has concealed from me to have the pleafure of furprifing me agreeably.

I argued myfelf at length into a belief " that this was the truth. The agitation of
my fpirits fubfided. I returned to my
. lodgings, and endeavoured to meet Manon
#
as ufuah She received me alfo with an air of pleafure and affedion, and I was tempted inftantly to difcover to her my late uneafinefs, and its fource *, but I re^ frained, ftill flattering myfelf the would lead to , the converfation. In that hope I fat down to ftipper with as much cheat* fulnefs as I could afllime; but when candles were brought I thought 1 faw the traces of tears on the cheeks of Manon, and that an expreihon of inquietude fat on her countenance. I obferved that fine turned her eyes on me with a look rather of pity and regret, than ,of the warm femiments they were generally animated
wick
with. My eyes, while I made thele re-^ naarks, were alfo fixed on her’s with a look of melancholy anxiety. We neither of eat, but continued for fome moments gazing at each other in mournful filence.
At length I faw her beautiAil eyes fill with tears, which dreamed down her cheeks into her bofom. Perfidious tear/ ! which fhe could not help fliedding over the victim fhe was about to facrifice.
Manon! cried I, in the utmoft emo-
«
don, my dear Manon! what is all this?
O my God! v/hat can be the matter! from whence thefe tears? You weep! and the occafion of your forrow is unknown to me. She anfvvered me only by deep drawn fighs and a new flood of tears, w^hich alarmed me almofl; to dif-tra6don. I arofe, and throwing my arms
m
round her, I conjured her by all our love, 'and if flie would preferve my fenfes,
to

to tell me inftantly what had aflllded her? I caught the infedion, and Ihed tears myfelf while I killed her’s from her cheeks as they fell. The moft favage heart mull furely have been moved by thefe wai-m and artlefs exprefiions of love. Of love even to agony, which the fight of her grief threw me into.
While I was thus wholly occupied by my fear on her account, and conjuring her to explain the caufe of her concern, I heard the fteps of feveral perfons on the flairs: they tapped gently at the doorj and Manon having kiffed me^ while tears feemed to choak her utterance, tore herfelf away from me and ran haflily into'her dreffi ng room, the door of which fhe immediately locked within fide. I imputed this to herdif-like of being feen by any one, difordered and in tears. I advanced to the door to

bn what had befallen me. When I rc^ collcded the tranfadlions of the day, they appeared fo inexplicable that I was loft^ in conjeftures', yet none that I could
I ‘
make feemed to throw any light on the' myftery that furroiinded me. I was. cruelly betrayed, but by whom I knew not, Tiberge firft occurred to me. Ah, trah tor! muttered I to myfelf, I will be feverely revenged 1 Thy life fhall anfwer thy officioufnefs, if it is thee I But then I remembered that the place of my abode was wholly unknown to him, and therefore it was impoflible he could have given iny father; intelligence of me. Could I fufped Manon? my heart revolted at the idea: yet the unufual melancholy which feemed to overwhelm her, her tears, and^ the kifs (he had givex, me at parting, appeared very enigmatical. But Hill I felt difpofed to believe that all her diftrefs arofe from a fort of prefentiment of our
approaching

approaching misfortune: fo willing was I to deceive myfelf, and fo impoflible did I find it to believe that Manon would betray me. The refult therefore of my conjedture was, that I had been feen by fome perfons who knew me in the llr^ets of Paris, who had watched me home,
/V
and informed my father where I was concealed. This idea feemed confoling, and the perturbation of my mind began to fubfide, I concluded 1 Ihould fuffer fome fevere reproaches, and perhaps harfli treatment, from my father, which I determined to bear patiently *, to promife what^ ever he defired, and to efcape as foon as pofiible to Paris, to reftore life and hap-pinefs to my beloved Manon.
We foon arrived at St. Dennis. Mv brother, furprized at the filence I ob-ferved, and imagining it arofe from the apprehenfions I was under at meeting

tny father, undertook to re-affure me. ‘He told me I had nothing to fear from my father’s refentment, if I would determine to, enter quietly into my ufual courfe of life, and return to the duty I had fc grofsly violated. We pafled the night at St. Dennis; and my brother had the' precaution to make two of the fervants deep, in the room with me^ while another remained centinel. When I entered the inn, I perceived it to be that where Manon and I flopped on our way to Paris; a circumftance I now remembered with the moft painful regret. The mailer of the inn and his fervants recolledled me; and feeing my prefent fituation, eafily o-uefled at what had befallen me. To avoid their remarks, I haftened to my room as foon as we got out of the coach; and at day break the next day wc fet out in my father’s poll chaife, which was there wait-

My brother went to my father firft, in the defign of fpeaking in iny favor, by informing him of the docility with < which I fubmitted to his orders; fo that when I was admitted to his prefence he received me with lefs feverity than I expelled. He contented himfelf with making me fome general reproaches for the fault I had committed, by abfenting myfelf without his leave; and as to my miftrefs, he told me I thoroughly deferved what had happened to me, for my filly credulity. He faid he had once a better opinion of my underftanding; but hoped this adventure would teach me more prudence, I underftood this difeourfe only according to my own ideas-, and by no means as refleCling on the fidelity of Manon.

that I was permitted to fpeak of her who

‘ fervices done by Monfieur de Beaumanoir.
I was confufed and fliocked at that name, and fubmiflively defired an explanation of my father. He turned towards my brother^

ther, and enquired of hiin if he had nor related the whole to me? My brother anfwered, that I had appeared fo tranquil and reafonable during the journey, that he did not believe I had occafion for fuch a remedy to cure me of my folly.
I obferved that my father then, hefitated whether he Ihould explain himfelf: but I intreated him with fo much earneftnefs, that he determined to fatisfy me; or ra- , ther to aflaflinate me by the moil cruel .of all recitals..
He aflced me if I had really been fo fimple as to believe that I had poflefled the heart of Manon. I anfwered boldly that I was fo fure of it, that nothing in* the world could induce me to- doubt it a' moment. My father broke into a loud laugh at the folemnity of my manner, and the alTurance I feemed to have. Ex.r cellent! cried he *, excellent! Truly, my ^

He added a thoufand other railleries of the fame kind, while I re^ mained filent, with a beating heart. At length he continued to tell me, that according to a calculation he had made, from the time of my departure from Amiens, Manon had loved me about twelve daysj for, continued he, I know you went from thence on the tvfenty-eighth of laft month, this is the twenty-ninth of the prefent; it is eleven days fince Monfieur de Beanmanoir wrote to me-, I fuppofe he might be feven or eight in forming a connedlion with your Princefs: dediid therefore eight and eleven from the thirty one days you have lived together, and Ihe may poflibly have been conftant about twelves one or two more or lefs

I
You find, Chevalier, added my/ father,’ that Monfieur de Beaumanoir is now in poflefiion of your divinity, and removed you to obtain it.. For as to profeflions of difinterefted; friendfhip from a man I never faw, I have feen too much of the world to, believe them; nor is De Beau- ^

You may however glory in the length of your triumph, confidenng the excellent fubjedt

I was no longer able to iiften to a dif-courfe, every word of which was a dagger to my foul. I arofe j but had made only a ftep or two from the table, before I fell on the floor, and for fome minutes loft all recolledion in total infenfibility.
Immediate alTiftance brought me to myfelf: but I opened my eyes only to fhed a torrent of tears, and my lips only to complain in terms didlated by the bit-tereft defpair. My father, who always tenderly loved me, was affedled by the agony I was in, and employed every argument to confole me. I liftened to him, but underftood not what he faid j and infteadof the compofure he recommended,
I threw myfelf at his feet, imploring him

I meafured, in gloomy filence, the height of my window from the ground, and found all efcape by that means impoflible. I then addrelfed my-felf to the two fervants, and by every pro-mife I thought likely to tempt them, endeavoured to prevail on them tO'Confent to my efcape: but their fidelity was not to be fiiaken ; and in the madnefs of dcfpair I attacked them ..with menaces yet more impotent,

Finding every effort fruitlefs, my rage turned on myfelf. I determined to die. But as all means of deftroying myfelf were carefully kept from me, and the fervants were conftantly in the room, I could only throw myfelf on my bed, refolute to refufe every kind of nourifhment, and to rife from it no more. I paffed the night with-out deep, and the two following days without food. My father, alarmed at my obftinacy, came up to me on the evening of the fecond. He foothed me, and fpoke to me in a manner fo affedionate, that he reftored to me the power of fhedding tears, of which the violence of my forrow had deprived me. Having at length brought me to liften to him, he abfolutely commanded me to eat what he had direded to be brought to me, which with difficulty I obeyed ; and for many days I took nothing but by his abfolute command, and to avoid difobeying his peremptory orders.

Manon, fuch as I once thought her, was ever prefent to my imagination.	Her

But that refledtion only added to my regret and my torment, without curing me of my pafiion; which in the bottom of my heart burnt with as much violence as ever. I can die, my father!

My father was aflonifhed at my con-du6t; becaufe knowing the principles of honor in which I had been brought up, he thought every fentiment of my heart muft revolt at the treafon and duplicity of my miftrefs: but feeing me ftill fo devoted to her, he imagined my attachment was lefs to her in particular than to the fex in general. Perfuading himfelf ftrongly of this, and confulting only his affeflion for me, he determined to facrifice his own views rather than thwart my inclinations, where they could be properly indulged. My dear Chevalier, faid he, it has hitherto been my intention, you know, to put you into the order of Malta; but I fancy your

I aflfured him that after the cruel experience I had had, all women were equally indifferent to me j or rather, that I de-tefted them all. Come, come, faid my father, fmiling, we will find one who in perfon fhall be as like your Manon as pof-fible; and who, with as many charms of face and figure, fhall have an unblemifhed mind.

I fhall yet know how to avenge myfelf! Avenge yourfelf!'cried my father, and how? I will go to Paris, and deftroy them, together by firing the houfe. My father only laughed at fo wild a fpeech, and left me, directing the fervants to keep as ftriCl a'guard over me as ever,*
Six whole months elapfed without' producing any confiderable change in my dirpofition. I felt only a perpetual and painful vicifTitude between - rage and love, hope and defpair, as the image of

Sometimes I beheld her as the , lovelieft^ fofteft, and moft amiable of human creatures, and languiihed to return to her; then I thought of her as a beautiful monfter, ftained with a thoufand crimes, and made numberlefs refolutions to revenge myfelf on her for all my fuf-ferings. Vain language of refentment and defpondency! Manon was too deeply impreffed on my heart. Nothing could ever erafe the indelible impreflion which that tender though abufed heart had received.
The only relief I found was in books; with which my father fupplied me in abundance. By degrees they attracted my attention, and excited anew my curiofity.
1 went again through all the authors I had read at the College ; and love had fo much enlarged my ideas, that I now un-' derftood many paflages of Horace and
Virgil

Virgil which had formerly been obfcure to me. I amufed myfelf with making am amorous commentary on the fourth book! of the Eneid., Alas! cried I, as I wrote it,' Eneas fhoiild have poflelTed an heart like mine, to have tailed and to have returned as he ought the paflion of the tender
Dido.
In this ftate of mind I was: one day agreeably furprized by a vifit from rny friend Tiberge; of whom I had hitherto thought merely as a fchool friend, whom a fimilarity of ftudies and tempers had endeared to me for the time-, but I had no particular reafon to believe his attachment had taken a much deeper root than is ufual among college acquaintance. I now found him fo much improved, fo formed in his perfon, fo regulated in his manner, and with an air of fuch dignity and uaderllanding, that he infpired me

I liftened to this difcourfe from fo young a man with aftonilhment. My friend! continued he, what I ;fay to you, though it appears in an unufual ftile for a man of my age, is not the lefs true; of which I am perfedbly convinced. My inclination for pleafure is naturally as ftrong as your’s; but happily for me, my courfe of ftudies, and a mind over which reafon has yet a ftronger influence, has enabled me to compare the effedls of indulging myfelf in dilTipation, or adhering to flridt rectitude
titude of morals; and I have been long fo well perfiiaded of the advantage of the latter, that I have determined to conquer my popenfities to the follies of the world; and I have already fo far learned to defpife them, that I fhoLild before now have quitted it for ever, if my regard for you had not with-held me. The hope of being ufeful to you, has kept me from leaving a feene for which I have no longer any relilh, and devoting myfelf wholly to a cloifter. My dear Charles, I know the excellence of your heart, and the foundnefs of your imderftanding*, and I am convinced there is nothing great and good of which you are not capable.

You have feen Manon then ? faid I:—^ Happy fellow ! and I—am condemned to

His friendlhip was fo nobly difinterefted, he knew fo well how to flatter my abilities, and to mingle praife and pity with advice and reproaches, that my inclinations again arofe to embrace the life I had

Alas! the impolTibility of living for Manon had really more influence with me than the' didlates of devotion, which I did not feel: and a world, in which I mufl: be for ever feparated from her, was to me a world of infipidity and difgufl:.
My refolution however to take the ton-fure became, as I then thought, every day more Ifrongly confirmed. I remembered that in this line the bifhop of Amiens had prognofticated for me honors and preferment : and fo efledlually was my imagination impofed upon by my prefent fenti-ments, that I believed I could really renounce every thing but the holy purfuits of religion.

Ids from any fatis- * ' fadion I Ihould have in hearing them, than to give me an higher relilh for my retirement, in contemplating at a dif-tance the vain and ridiculous purfuits of mankind.

Tiberge, whofe vifits now became frequent, obtained of my father a greater degree of liberty for me, and took upon himfelf the completion of my cure.

It was now near a twelve month fince
t
I had been at Paris, without enquiring
after Manon. At firft I found this for-
. %
bearance required great efforts, and a conftant guard on myfelfj but the watchful prudence and nice admonitions of Tiberge, as well as my own refledtions, prevailed fo far, that at the end of this period I thought myfelf on the point of forgetting for ever that feducing but perfidious charmer.
At this time it happened that I was to
exhibit in public a theological exercife,
and I had invited many perfons of fafhion
to

I

to honor me with their prefence, by which means my name ^nd intentions became known throughout Paris. It reached the ears of Manon: and though fhe could not be abfolutely certain it was myfelf under my newly afllimed title of the Abbe des Grieux, yet the name itfelf was too intereftlng to her not to give her a ftrong CLiriofity to liften whenever it was men~
■ tioned; and not being able to fatisfy herfelf any otherwife whether it was me or not, Ihe attended at St. Sulpice with fome of her acquaintance, where in the Abbe des Grieux, exhibiting a theological compofition, flie eafily recognifed her deceived and forfaken lover.
I knew nothing of this vilit at the time; for in thefe places there are departments where the ladies fit, concealed by a lattice and curtains. I returned to my cob lege chambers overwhelmed with praifes
E 4	and
I
t

and compliments on my performance,
when., about an hour afterwards I was
%
informed that a lady in the parlour defired to fpeak to me. I inftantly attended her; but what was my aftonilhment and emotion, when in this ftranger I beheld Manon! It was herfelf, but infinitely more lovely and dazzling than I had ever yet feen her. Her countenance was more bewitching than ever; her air and fhape all that can be imagined of elegance and grace. She was now in her eighteemh year, and her beauty was fuch as mull have been beheld to be fully known, for to conceive it from defcription is impof-
fible!	.	■

Had a thunder bolt fallen before me, it could not more entirely have deprived me of my fenfes. I knew it was herfelf, but that was all. I trembled, my lips
refufed to articulate the words I would
have
s
#
have uttered, and with- down cafl: eyes and a palpitating heart I awaited in filence an explanation of this extraordinary vifit. Her embarraffment was at firft equal to mine: but finding I continued filent, fhe put a handkerchief to her eyes to wipe away the tears with which they were filled, and then in a timid and faultering voice faid, that fhe confefTed hercondudl; might deferve my contemptand hatred, yet furely if ever I had had any regard for her, it was cruel to let almoft two years pafs away without once enquiring after herj and it accorded but little with the tendernefs of my nature to fee her in the diftrefs fhe was then in before me, without endeavouring to con-fole her, without offering one word of pity or pardon.

tinned {landing, and leaning againft the wainfcot, turned half from her, not ' daring to meet her eyes. I attempted to reply, but the words died away on my lips, and left me only the power to arti* culate, ah! perfidious, cruel, cruel Manon! Her tears flov/ed faft, while fhe faid that fhe meant not to attempt to juf-tify herfelf. What do you mean then, cried I? To die! faid fhe, if I cannot regain your heart: for without it I find life in-fupportable. Ah, no! anfwered I, barbarous, ungrateful Manon! it is my life
$
you would have; my life, w’hich is the only thing I have not already facrificed to you. Farewel! You know your
V
fatal' afcendancy; too well I feel that my heart, my weak heart has never ceafed to be your’s. At thefe words fhe arofe, and threw herfelf into my arms, giving . me the m.oft pafiionate careffes, and lavifh- i ing on me every epithet of endearment that the tendered love could didate. ' I

y
received her fondnefs with languor and-coldnefs, my fenfes had not yet recovered the torpor into which the firft fhock of this dear but fatal interview had thrown them. I fhuddered at the gulph I faw opening under my feet, which I knew I ihonld not have ftrength to avoid;, as a traveller' who finds himfelf benighted amidft precipices and torrents which he is obliged to -pafs, feels his courage and ftrength forfake -
him, and trembles while he examines the.
\
various horrors that furround him.
s
We fat down by each other. I took her hand in mine, and looking mournfully on her, ah, Manon! faid I; Manon! could I have expefled the dark, the barbarous treafon with which you have repaid the fincereft and moft ardent love? Gruel-girl! how could you prevail on yourfelf fo inhumanly to betray aJieait which was
wholly.
f
wholly your*s; which trufted all its hopes to you? Ah! how could you deliberately determine to affaflinate this bofom, which had no wiih, no happinefs but what you bellowed; or any defire fo warm as that of feeing you happy! Tell me, fickle and deftrudlive beauty! have you found another like it? Nature among all her works has made none fo formed for love, faith, and dcfpairl Tell me, how^ever, have you not fometimes regretted the heart you had wounded to death ?—furely^you mull. Yet now that you come voluntarily to la-vilh on me all thefe teftimonies of affection, what dependance can I have upon you? To my deftrudlion, I fee you are . more lovely, more bewitching than ever! By all the atiguifh I have fuffered! by all the facrifices I have made you! tell me, Manon, will you be more faithful ? She.anfwered me fo affedlingly, protefled
with
9
I
with fo much earneftnefs her fincere repentance, and fo folemnly affured me of her future fidelity, that my heart was wholly fubdued.
Ah, Manon! faid I, intermingling ex-prefTions of facred and profane love, thou art too amiable for a creature! I find my foul influenced by an irrefiflible delectation! All that I learned of intelledual liberty at St. Sulpice is a chimera. I go to lofe my fortune, my reputation, every thing for you! I fee it plainly. I read my deftiny in that heavenly face. But for what facrifices, what misfortunes, will not your love confole me! Fortune and glory, I ^';^^ive ye to the winds! my hopes of preferment I refign, and give up all that I cannot enjoy with thee! Vain and def-picable appear all my fchemes, and my firmeit refolutions are diflblved by one glance of thofe feducing eyes.
I now
I now promiled her an eternal and fin-cere forgivenefs for all that had paffcd; ; and when we began to difcoiirfe with ' more coh^ence, I defired her to tell me by what temptations fhe had been prevailed upon to leave me and to betray me to my father. She told me that Monfieur de Beaumanoir having feen her at the window, became paflionately in love with her, and made her a declaration in the flile of a Farmer General; that is, he wrote ‘ to offer her an handfome allowance, a houfe, carriage and jewels, if fhe would quit me and live with him. At firft fhe affedted to capitulate only in hopes of getting from him a fum of money which might enable us to live comfortably, bat fhe gradually became dazzled by his pre- | fents and promifes.^ But I might judge, fhe faid, of her reludtance and remorfe, . when I recolledled the grief that overwhelmed her the evening of our fepara-
tion;
%
tion; and that not withftanding the opulence that had furronnded her, fhe had
/
never been happy with De Beaumanoir: not only becaufe he poffefled not my fen^ timents and my manners, but becaufe, amid all the gaiety .and pleafure flie was induced to partake, the remembrance of my love and attachment ftill feftei^d in her heart, which incefiantly reminded her of her ingratitude, and tormented her with reproaches, for which diffipation was a very inadequate remedy.
She mentioned the vifit Tiberge had
O
made her. Had he Ihewn me a dagger fent by you to avenge your wrongs, I think it could not, have ftruck me more painfully than did the found of your name-, and his enquiries I was quite unable to anfwer. She then told me how Ihe happened to hear of my being at Paris, and of the exercife I was to per-

form at the Sorbonne; and that fhe had
been fo agitated during the performance,
«
that it was with the utmofl difficulty ihe redrained her tears and exclamations.i H avinsT daid till the lad- that her dilbrder
I
might not be noticed, and difengaged herfelf from her companions, ffie lidened only to the impetuofity of her wiffies tOj fpeak to me, and ordered her coadij diredtly to St. Sulpice, determined not to[
furvive my refufing to forgive her. i
!
Where is the favage heart that this! lively repentance and returning tendernefsi would not have affedted ? As to myfelf, I felt at that moment that I diould for
4
Manon have refigned all the Bilhoprids of the Chridian world.	. i
But it was time to confider what we^' intended to do. Manon defired me iii-ftantly to quit the feminary, that we
might
V
might confult together in a place of greater fafety ■, and as I then recollefted that every moment it was probable Tiberge might come in fearch of me, there was no time for hefitation. She got into her coach, and ordered it to wait at the corner of a neighbouring ftreet *, and a moment afterwards I efcaped from the houfe without being queftioned by the porter, and rejoined her. We then drove to la fripperie, where I furniflied myfelf with a coat, hat, and a fword, which Manon paid for. I had not a Ihilling in my pocket; and we both fo much dreaded being impeded in our flight, that Ihe infilled on my not going
t
to my room to fetch what money I had. Indeed the fum was inconfiderablc: and as {he was well provided, we relinquifhed it without reludtance.
We conferred together in the fripier’s {hop on what was next to be done. Manon
determined
determined to keep no terms with De Beaumanoir, but to facrifice him wholly to me. I will leave the furniture, faid Ihe,
* and the things in the houfe, exadlly as they are; but the jewels he has given me ■ are furely my own, as are about' fixty thoLifand francs, which I have faved out of the fums of money he has given me; fince I have lived with him. He has no power over me, therefore we may take a convenient houfe, and live comfortably at Paris without any apprehenfions of his molefting us.
r
I reprefented to her that tho’ there was no rifk for her in fuch an arrangement, there was much for me, who could hardly fail of being known, and fliould continu-l ally be expofed to the fame danger I had'i before experienced. I found however that, to quit Paris would be extremely difagree-able to her j and before the fear of making
S
ing her imeafy every other confideration vanifhed. I therefore thought of a middle courfe, which was, to hire an houf« or lodging in the immediate neighbourhood of Paris, from whence we might be foon in town when bufinefs or pleafure called us. To this fhe aflented, and we fixed on Chaillot; after which Manon went back to her houfe, direding me to wait for her at the little gate of the Thuilleries ; whither Ibe returned to me in lefs than an hour in an hired coach, in which was the fervant who waited on her, and feveral large trunks, containing her deaths, jewels, and linen. .
%
We haftened immediately to Chaillot, and lodged that night at the inn, intending to employ the next day in feeking an houfe or elegant lodging. We foon found one that was exadly to our mind: and there we began to live fo happily, that I
believed
(
t
w
s
believed all my forrows were at an end» The foftnefs and fweetnefs of Manon’s temper, her attention to the flighteft of my wiflies, and the charms of her wit and vivacity, made me forget,, in the delirium of the tendereft love, all I had fuffered ‘ and all I had facrificed.
I
i
\
As we had now acquired a little more experience, I determined to confider well the film we poffefied, and regulate our ’
t
expences accordingly. Sixty thoufand francs, tho* a confiderable fum, were not enough for the demands of a long life;! nor were either of us much difpofed to ► ftraiten ourfelves in point of cxpence.
w
CEconomy was by no means a virtue which either Manon or I polTefled : but ray mode ’ of calculating, in fpeaking of our future manner of life to her, was thus: Two thoufand crowns a year, faid I, will maintain us handfomely while we continue at Chaillot,
where
9
L yj J
where we 'Will live with fimple elegance. Our principal expences will be for a coach and public places. As you love the opera, we will go thither twice a week: as to play, 'we will determine to lofe no more than two piftoles at a fitting. By thefe regulations our fixty thoufand francs may lafl nine or ten years, during which time it is almoft impofTible but that fome -event muft happen that will fet us en-tirely at eafe. My father is not young, and it is improbable he fhould live fo' longi at his deceafe I fhall pofTefs a fortune that will place me beyond the malice of my defliny.
This management was not the moft abfurd of my plans, had we been’ wife enough to have adhered to if. But our refolution did not hold out above a month, Manon was paflionately fond of diiflipa-tion, I was paflionately fond of her, and
every
»
I
«
every moment new temptations to expence arofe; while on my part, far from regret-ting the profufion with which llie threw away money, I fludied to anticipate her wifhes, and to procure for her whatever fhe liked.
Our refidence at Chaillot now began to be difagreeable to her. Winter was I approaching, every body was going back to Paris, and the country became deferted and melancholy. She propofed that we Ihould return, and eftablifli ourfelves there; but to that I had numberlefs rea-fons for not confenting: to gratify her however in fome meafure, I agreed to take a ready furniihed apartment, where we ^might occafionally pafs the night; for as we were fometimes late at public places, we found it inconvenient to return home to Chaillot at thofe hours, which was her principal plea for defiring to change
our
t
%
*

V
L	J
f	^	*
our refidence. In pnrfuance of this fcheme, which was the very worft I could have adopted, we engaged a furnifhed lodging, and frequently paffed the night
there; but it foon was the remote occafion
»
of our undoing, by entangling us in con-nedlions and events, from the confe-quences of which we could never after recover.
I
Manon had a brother in the guards many years older than herfelf, who moft’ unhappily for us lodged in the very ftreet where we took this temporary apartment.
He faw his lifter at the window, and came without ceremony to fpeak to her. This man was rude, brutal and uneducated, without honor, fentiment or pity j and knowing fomething of his filter’s adventures, he began by loading her with every term he could imagine of the grolTeft abufe. It happened fortunately for lis
both
\
both that I was gone out when he came, as I was not at all difpofed to fulFer fuch an inlult tamely. When I returned to Manon, which was a few minutes after he had left her, I found her in tears and con-llernation; and on enquiring the caufe, Ihe related to me what had happened, Her entreaties only prevented my going' out inftantly in fearch of him: but while
r
we were yet debating he returned. I did not however know him; and Manon, ter-rined at the indignation I had exprelTedj againfl: him, had not courage to tell me,j I received him therefore as a ftranger, while he, alTuming an air of pleafantry, told Manon he .was come to beg her pardon for his violent behaviour. Then addrefling himfelf to me, he faid he had believed at firft that his filler lived in a 4 dilbrderly and debauched way, which had excited his difpleafure, but having heard
from my fervants who I was, he had
fince
/
f
' ' ' i i	•
L 97 J
fince enquired my charader, which enquiry turned out fo much to my advantage, that far from meaning to renew his reproaches to his fifter, he was come to offer us his fervices, and to affurc' us that nothing would make him happier than to live in friendfhip with us, Ridi», culous and affronting as I thought this fpeech, I faw the eyes of Manon brighten on it, and a look from her was always enough to determine me: I therefore gave him a civil anfwer, and accepted of his offered hand; after which we detained him to dinner, and he foon became fo familiar, and fo perfectly at his eafe, that when he found we intended to return that evening to Chaillot he defired to accompany us, and took his place in our coach with great compofure.
From that period he became much more mailer of my houfe than I was my-
F	felf.
\
«
\
fdf. He honored me with the appelW tion of brother; and on the ftrength of the relationfhip, made nfe of our houfe and our purfe as his own-, bringing his friends (who were far from being very defirable acquaintance) to be entertained at our expence. He went ftill farther, and not only engaged us to pay feveral debts for him, for large fums, but ordered himfelf fafhionable cloaths and handfotne linen, the bills for which he fent to us to be difcharged. To all thefe impofitions I foi fome time fubmitted rather than give pain to Manon, and I affed:ed not to know
I
the fums he from time to time drew from
/ >
her. Sometimes, indeed, when he had s
\
fuccefsfnl run of play, he had the con-fcience to return her a part of what be had taken; but our whole fund was too] inconfiderable to fupport long the addition of his dem.anas to expences before too great. I determined therefore to
o
fpeak
\
\
L	J
fpeak to him plainly, when an accident intervened which precluded the necefllty of my remonftrance, and plunged me into an abyfs of diftrefs and wretched-nefs.
We had pafled a day and a night at Parish as we often did, when the following morning the fervant, v/ho on thefe occa-fions was left at Chaillot, came early to tell me, that in the night the houfe had by fome accident taken fire, which was with the utmoft difficulty extinguifiied by the neighbours. I afked her if our furniture had fuffered, and if we had loft; any thing? She told me that the croud, which had prefled in under pretence of aflifting, had been fo great, that ftie could anfwer for nothing, and that all the doors had been broken. My heart funk when I thought of the caflcet I had left in my clofet, in which the whole of our little
F 2	fortune
A
fortune was depofited, I ran to Chaillot, Alas! howfruitlelsly! The cafket was gone, and we were reduced at once to the moft deplorable poverty. I then felt how much it was poflible to love money, without being avaricious. I forefav/ all the evils to which this cruel lofs would expofei me, and 1 was ftruck with it as .with the hand of death. Ah! exclaimed I, I fliall lofe again all that makes life worth my
%
care; for I know that Manon, all tender and attached to me as fhe is in profpe-rity, will fhrink from poverty and adver-fity : fhe will again facrifice me to the pleafures of affluence, which fo many will be ready to offer her, and nothing will aemain for me but eternal defpair.
I
Thefe refiedlions were fo dreadful, that I hefitated whether it was not better to end all my fufferings by a voluntary death, than to live in the wretchednefs 1 faw preparing
paring for me. But then, as is always the cafe in thefe dreadful paroxifms of paffion, it occured to me that I fliould firft enquire if no refource remained*, and an idea prefented itfelf that a little fof-tened the anguifli of my mind. I thought it not impofiible to conceal from Manon this heavy lofs, at leaft for a little while; and hoped that chance or good fortune might in the interim furnifh me with the means of fupporting her in the way Ihe now lived in, I thought, faid I to myfelf, when I confidered the refourfc we have now loft, that twenty thoufand crowns would fufhec us ten years; let me fuppofe thofe ten years already gone, and that none of the events I thought probable, had happened in my family. Had it been fo, how did I then mean to have fupported myfelf? In truth I know
not: but whatever I fhould have done
%
then,, I may do now. How many are
F 3	there
I
there who live at Paris, whofe refources
nobody knpws; and who, without any
advantages of perfon or underftanding,
owe their fortune entirely to themfelves.
Nature, to make amends for the injuftice
of fortune, frequently bellows genius and
talents on thofe to whom Ihe has denied,
or from whom Ihe has withdrawn her
favors 5 by which the different ranks of
men are brought nearer an equality : and
the poor, by adminiftering to the vanity
%
or pleafures of the rich, partake of the advantages of affluence.
I
j
By thefe arguments I tried to perfuade myfelf that I might find fome method to fupport Manon; and for her there was nothing I would not have undertaken. I became in a Ihort time more compofed; and I determined to confult Monfieiir L’Efcaut, the brother of Manon, as to
what courfe of life I ought to enter upon
in
»
I
in my prefent fituation. He was perfectly acquainted with the town *, and on feveral occafions I had feen enough of his manner of life, to be convinced that it v;as not from any property he polTeffed, Of from the king’s pay, that his appearance and expences were fupported. I went to him, and related to him what had happened, fhewing at the fame time my piirfe, containing only about twenty piftoles, which was now become all my fortune; and I alked him, whether on a view of my circumftances he thought it moft advifeable for me to flioot myfelf through the head, or wait till famine and. defpair put an end to my exiftence.
He anfwered with the utmoft coolhefs, that for a young fellow like me to flioot myfelf was very abfurd, and what no lad of fpirit would think of; and as to dying of famine and defpair, any body might
F 4	be
be reduced to that, who was fo fcrupn; lous as to refufe the means which his own talents or connexions might fiir-nifli him with; and that if I would confider what I was fitteil for, I might afliire myfelf of his advice and afliftance. All this is very vague, Monfieur L’Ef-caut, faid I; my wants require an inftant fupply, or how am I to meet Manon? Apropos, anfwered he, of Manon; your inquietude is about her, and yet in her | alone you are pofTefTed of the means to finifh all your folicitudes: nay liiore, her beauty is a refource to maintain her, you and me. The rage and indignation I found riling in my heart was with difR-culty reftrained while he continued to tell me that if I would follow his advice he would engage before evening to divide a thoufand crowns with us; for I am acquainted, faid he, with an old nobleman,
fo liberal and fo amorous, that he would
not
}
♦
not fail to offer any price for the good graces of fo handfome a girl as my fifter.
Stop, Mdnfieur L*Efcaut! cried I; this is difcourfe to which I cannot liften, and which I beg never to hear repeated. I had indeed conceived a- better opinion of your friendfhip for me, and little thought to have been affronted with fo difgraceful a propofal. He laughed at my warmth ; and with the moft difgufling affurance told me, that fince his filter had once broken through the laws of her fex, (tho* in favor of the man in the world for whom he had the greateft efteem) he thought any future, violation of decorum a matter of the moft perfect indifference 5 and bad reconciled himfelf to her with no other view than to fhare the profits of her proftitution.
Shocked as I was with this infamous
/
declaration, and with the wretch who made
F 5	it.
it, he was now fo necefiary to me that ! dared not exprefs the horror and deteftation he infpired me with; and therefore, with ■a forced fmile, told him that this was an
V
expedient to be thought of only at the laft extremity. I befought him to confider of fome other, and he then propofed to me to become the penfioner of fome rich dowager, to whom my age and figure might recommend me: but this plan was hardly lefs repugnant to me than the other, and I enquired of him what he thought of play ? The gaming table, anfwered he, is certainly a great refource, but it requires to be well underftood. To undertake to play on only the. common chances, is indeed to compleat or perpetuate your ruin.
You can never make any thing of it, tin-
>
lefs you know how to avail yourfelf of thofe little manoeuvres with which men of genius are obliged to corred or prevent the caprices of fortune.’
The
✓
TThe beft thing I can think of for youj, continued he, is the Affociationi but I much doubt whether the confederates will accept a member of your age: however I will fee what is to be done. So faying, he left me, having offered me his purfe if I fhould have occafion for it, which indeed was more than I expeded of him ; but I. did not accept it, and requefted only that he would not acquaint Manon with the lofs. I, had fuftained, nor with the fubjed of our converfation,. which he readily promifed. ,
1 left him in greater uneafinefs than I had met him, and heartily repented having . entrufted him with my painful fecret. I* had obtained nothing by it which he might not equally have done for me without this imprudent confidence. Nor could I.at all depend on his promife of fecrecy,: on the contrary, I had every reafon to apprehend
that he would difclofe it, to induce Manon ,
to
*
to quit me; and in the view of making his advantage of her charms, prevail on her to feek the proteflion of a richer and more fortunate lover.
Thefe ideas threw me back into all the agony of mind from which I had juft re-. covered. I then thought of writing to my father, and under pretence of feeling new regret for my indifcretions, folicit a fupply of money, to enable me to return home: but to this expedient I dared not truft, when I remembered that notwith-ftanding all his affedion for me, and the tendernefs of his nature, he had clofely confined me fix months for my firft fault; whence it was but too probable, that for a fecond error, and after all the noife oc-cafioned by my flight from St. Sulpice, I ihould be treated with infinitely greater 'rigour, if I put myfelf into his power again.

Amidft a chaos of perplexing thoughts, one at length occurred to me that I was aftonilhed I had not recollefted foonerj which was to apply to my friend Tiberge, from whofe unfailing friendfhip I believed I fiiould obtain immediate afliftance. The triumph of virtue is here worthy of remark. Certain as I was that Tiberge would difapprove my manner of life, yet fo ftrong was my reliance on his honor and generofity, that I knew I ran no rirque by entrufting him with my necef- ' fities, and the place of my abode j and that although he might not have it in his power to alTill mej I Ihould meet with companion and fympathy from him. The heart that (brinks from the generality of mankind, opens itfelf before goodnefs and probity like his, as a flower which doles before the chilling wind, expands to the genial influence of the vernal fun.

In

In purfuance of this hope of afliftance,
I determined to fee Tiberge before evening ; and immediately, returned home to write a few lines to him, in which I defired he would meet me at a time and place I named to him y and entreated fecrecy and difcretion, as abfolutely neceflary in the prefen t ft ate of my affairs. The joy I felt in the hope of Tiberge’s alTiftance effaced the traces of uneafinefs which Manon muft otherwife have perceived on my countenance. I mentioned tO‘ her the accident that had happened at Chaillot as a trifle which ought not to difturb her j
I
and as. ftie was always beft pleafed to be at Paris, fhe was not forry to hear me fay we would continue there, till fome flight reparations were made that the fire rendered neceffary.
About an hour after 1 had fent my [ letter I received Tiberge’s anfwer, who
prQmifed
promifed to meet me at the place I had appointed. I went thither with the utmoil impatience, though not without a fenfation of fhame and remorfe at appearing before a friend whofe very looks
1
muft reproach me for the faults and dif-orders of my life. But the gentlenefs and candor of his charadler, and tlie preffing neceffities of Manon, gave me confidence to meet him. The place of affignation was the garden of the palace royal, Tiberge was there before me •, and as foon as hefaw me, approached with, open arms, and with tears in his eyes. I meet you, faid I, my dear Tiberge, with confufion^ and I feel, a lively forrow for my ingratitude towards you. Tell me, I conjure }Oii, if it is yet permitted me to call you my friend, after having fo much deferved to lofe your

for me; a regard, continued he, which I muft ftill cherifli, notwithftanding the pain it gives me, for pain I mnft feel in contemplating your unhappy infatuation. I am as one who fees a beloved objed dying of a diieafe to which he is not fiif-fered to apply a remedy. A deep figh here efcaped me. Ah! ray friend, cried, I, your cornpaflion muft be indeed great if it equals the torture that I fuffer at this moment. I almoft dread to difclofeto you from whence it arifes that I am juh now fo wretched; but fo compleatly am I miferable, that you would pity me though you loved me lefs than you do.
He defired I would recount to him what had happened fince I fo precipitately and imprudently left St. Sulpice. I gave him, without dilTimAilation, a detail of all that had palled; and far from difguifing or
foftening
✓
%
foftening my errors, I confefled them in their utmoft extent, and fpokc of my fatal paffion Vv^ith ail the ardor with which , I felt it. I reprefented myfelf as one under the influence of an overruling def-tiny, from which I could not efcape; but which mull overwhelm a wretch for whom all the endeavours of honor, duty and friend0iip had been exhaufted in vain.
I drew To lively a pidture of the ftate of my mind, and the agonies of fear and defpair I had felt only two hours before, and which I mull again feel if my friend abandoned me as I had already been
t
abandoned by fortune, that poor Ti-berge was extremely affedled, and companion gave him emotions almoft as ftrong as my uneafmefs gave me. He repeated the moft friendly affurances of alTiftance, but fpoke as if my parting with Manon was a meafure which in my prefent circumftances I certainly meant
to
to adopt. To undeceive him at once as to that, I told him plainly that it was that very reparation I dreaded as the greateft evil that could befall mej and that I would fufFer the laft extremity of mifery, nay the moft cruel death, rather than fnbmit to what would be the moft infupportable of all misfortunes.
If you revolt, faid Tiberge, at a pro* pofal which I confider as a preliminary to your return to reafon and to happinefs, tell me, dear Charles, what I can do for you ? I dared not fay that it was with his purfe'^he could alfift me ; but at length he comprehended it, and told me he nn-derftood me.
For fome moments he ftood filent and penfive, deliberating how to a6t. To what a fitnation do you reduce me, faid
V
he. Shall I refufe you, my friend, the
only
I
only fuccour you will accept, or lhall I violate all my duty by granting it. ' Alas! in doing' the latter do I not encourage you to perfevere in a courfe of life ruinous to your principles, and deftrudive of your charader? But yet, continued he, it may be that the unhappy lituation of your affairs, the dread of indigence, and the tumult of contending pafTions, leave you not at liberty to conquer this unhappy malady of the foul. A mind ill at eafe liftens not to the voice of honor, and knows not how to regain a path once loft. I will therefore, niy unfortunate friend, find means to affift you, but let me make this condition with you; which is, that you fhall tell me where
you are to be found, and fuffer me to
%
try what I can do to recall yon once more to reputation and tranquillity. I agreed with pleafure to this reafonable requeft, and implored his companion for
his
his poor friend, the peculiar malignity of whofe fate made the fublime attachment of fuch a foul as his of no avail in faving him from misfortune and wretchednefs.
We now went together to his banker’s, who on his note advanced an hundred pif toles, for he was by no means able to fur-nlfh me wiih it himfelf in ready money. I have already obferved he was not rich from his family ; and tho’ his benefice was worth a thoufand crowns a year, yet this being the firfl: year he poflefTed it, he had received no part of the income: it was therefore on the credit of the growing profits that he made me this advance, I felt
moft truly his extraordinary generofity ^ fo deeply indeed did it for the moment affed ^ me, that I could not but confider with re-morfe my unjuftifiable condiKd, and the unworthy captivity in which I was held. This idea, and a fenfe of the mean and'
wretched
wretched part I was adting, made me wifh to throw off my chains; but the moment I faw Manon all thefe refle6lions vanifhed: a fmile, a look from her, would I verily believe have drawn me out of Paradife; and while I gazed on the moft perfed and moft enchanting of all Heaven’s works, I wondered how I could ever think of ceafing to adore an objed fo irrefiftibly charming.
Beautiful however as her form was, her mind had fome unhappy fingularities that were of the moft diftrefting confequence to me. Without the fmalleft taint of avarice, ftie could not for amomentfuftain the dread of wanting money. Pleafure and diffipa-tion were abfolutely neceflary for her j and as long as fhe could be amufed, (he never troubled herfclf about the means by which her amufements were procured; nor be-ftowed a thought on the future, while the prefent was palling away agreeably. And
tho*
L ^^8 J
\
tho’ (he profefied to love me ardently, and pr^ifefted that every other man was indifferent to her, I had but too much reafon to fear that all her tendernefs for me would be unequal to fupport her againft the dread of want. With a moderate fortune, I believed fhe would have preferred me to all the world ; but I believed alfo, that fhe would abandon me for fome new De Beau-manoir, when I fhould have nothing to offer her but the homage of a tender heart. On fome lovers this temper would have perfedted a cure, but on me it had another effedt, and determined me to circum-fcribe my own expences, rather than not fuppOrt her’s j and not to refufe her even the moft fuperfiuous gratifications, tho’ I denied myfelf the neceffaries of life.
f
The coach that we kept was a fubjedl
of greater alarm to me than all the reft;
%
' for it was impoffible to flatter myfelf that
we
#
we could pay the weekly coll of the coachman and horfes. L’Efcaut knew I h .d borrowed an hundred piftoles of a friend^ and to hirn I imparted my uneafinefs about the coach. He then renewed our conver-fation on the fubjedt of play, and told me that if I had now an inclination to try my fortune, it would be proper to introduce myfelf to the aflbciation by fpending an hundred or an hundred and fifty livres in making an entertainment for them; w^hich he thought, together with his recommendation, would enfure my reception among them on a refpe<5table footing,, and enlift me as a novice of fome confequence among the Chevaliers d’Indullrie.
Great as my dillike was to become a member of fuch a fociety, all my fcruples vanifhed before the dread of lofing Manon, and I agreed to his propofal. L/Efcaut prefented me to them the next evening as
a relation

L	J
a relation of his own, defirons of beconi' ing one of their party ; and added that I fhould have a ftrong inducement to profit by their inftrudions, as few had fo much occafion for the favors of fortune. But to convince them that my necefTities were not fuch as a gentleman ought to blufli at, he told them I had ordered a flipper, at which I requefted their company; They accepted the invitation, and I entertained them at an expence I could ill afford. My figure and addrefs were the fubjed of their warmeft praifes. They told me how much they relied on the proficience of fo pro* mifing a pupil; particularly as being quite unknown, young, and with a countenance remarkably open and ingenuous, nobody could poffibly fufped that I belonged to a fociety who lived by the unguarded and unpradifed players.

had fuftained at Chaillot; and to convince her fhe had no reafon to lament it, I hired an handfome furnifhed houfe, and put our -eftablifhment on the footing of a family in affluence and fecurity.
\
During this time Tiberge made me fre* quent vilits; and there was no end to the ledures he gave me. He unceafingly reprefented to me that my prefent way of life was ruinous to my morals, my repu-• tation, and my fortune. I heard him with patience condemn a condud I felt not the lead; inclination to alter. I knew he really meant well, and could not be angry at his zeal, which however began to be very fatiguing to Manon. Sometimes in her
prefence

ftrelence I laughed at his foleinn remon-ftrances, and exhorted him not to be more fcrupulous than were numberlefs bifliops and other of the clergy, who made no difficulty of keeping a fat benefice with a fair miftrefs; and fhewing him the fine

Tiberge in his turn had patience with me and ftill hoping that his perfevering friendfhip might h^lp to open my eyes, he facrificed even his rigid attention to appearances, and continued for fome weeks to frequent my houfe, difreputable as it was. But when at the end of that time he found no hopes of an alteration, but that notwithftanding my expenfive eftablifh-ment my riches feemed to encreafe *, when he found that I enlarged my ftile of living, and purllied with redoubled eagernefs

by the cant he had heard at St. Sulpice, "His difcoiirfe however did not wholly fail of efFe6l: chagrin and difquiet remained for a while ftrongly marked on my countenance •, but a kifs from Manon, who fmiled in my face, and propofed fome

We lived at this time in fuch a conftant fucceflion of amufements, that I had little time and lefs inclination to refledt. My fuccefs daily encreafed my riches, and
0
with it our attachment feemed if poflible to encreafe alfo. Venus and Fortune never
i
had two happier fubjedls than we then were. I was tempted to deny that a world where I poflefled fo much happinefs, could
, ' be
%
e a vale of tears; and forgetting every ling I had before fuffered, became ao picurean in principle as well as in prac-ce. But all this was not to laft: bitter-efs and anguifh were following clofe upon s, and all Tiberge’s prophecies on the
i
oint of being fulfilled. I had won lb luch money at play, that I began to Dnfider how I Ihould place it out to the eft advantage:, but I deliberated inftead
O

I
I had hired a valet de chambre, who 'as well acquainted with the fource from hich I procured money, and was indeed )o much entrufted: Manon’s maid, who as alfo much in her miftrefs’s favor, ad as much relied upon, was a very retty girl, and my man took it into is head to be in love with her ; the con-

it’quence of which was, that they, {© procure themfelves money to enable them to marry and eftablifh themfelves, contrived a , fcheme to rob us; which they executed with fo much fuccefs, that we never afterwards could recover from the inconveniencies it threw us into. To rob us indeed was eafy enough, confidering the thoughtlefs and unguarded way in which we lived,
.	V
One evening after the play we flipped with L’Efcaut, and returning home about midnight, I called as ufual for my valet de chambre, and Manon for her woman; the other fervant told us they had both been gone out fome hours, having firft fent away feveral trunks and packages, as they faid, by my orders. I inftantly guefied at part of the truth-, and on going into my apartment I found the locks of my bureau had been forced, my notes
and
and money taken, together with my deaths and linen, of which they had not left me even a change. Before I could recover from the {hock occafioned by this difeovery, Manon came to me to tell me that the. fame plunder had been prac-tifed in her apartment. It was with difficulty I acquired fufficient command of-myfelf to refrain from cries and exclamations: but the apprehenfion of communicating my defpair to Manon, made me af- | fed a calmnefs I was far from feeling. Oh! cried I, be not fo uneafy; fome dupe at. the hotel de Tranfylvanie fhall make us amends. But Manon was not to be
fo eafily confoled; and her diflrefs and
>
confternation overcame every effort I could make to reftore her courage and my own. We are lofi, faid fhej ruined beyond refource ! In effed I felt this to be -too true : we w'ere at once ftripped and pennylefs.

Not knowing what elfe to do, I ran back to L’Efeaut, who advifed me to go immediately to the Lieutenant of the Police, and the Grand Provoft of Paris. I did fo, but I only encreafed the calamities which furrounded me-, for befides that the enquiries of thcfe officers of juf-tice were of no avail, I gave L^Efcaut, who went direftly to his fitter, time and opportunity to talk to her, and to prevail on her to confent to a projedt which made me more wretched than my lofs.
He told her that if flie would fuffer him to introduce her to Monfieur Gevres de Malleville, a man as celebrated for debauchery as for his riches, and whofe liberality was well known where he was attached, that fhe would be immediately placed in a more brilliant fituation than any (he had ever enjoyed; and probably obtain from this fuperannuated libertine, a
fettlement
>
fettlement which would put her out of the reach of the peryerfe deftiny that with me feemed to purfue her.. In a word,, he faid fo much, that in the agitation of her fpirits fhe confented to enter into his views; and. this honorable refolution was taken before my return, the execution, of it being delayed only till the next day, to give L’Efcaut an opportunity of apprizing De Malleville of the lady’s favourable fen* timents. When I got to my houfe, after my fruitlefs application to the Police, I found this kind brother waiting for. me; but Manon was gone to bed,, leaving a meffage for me with the fervants,. that being extremely fatigued, fhe defired to remain alone in her own apartment.
t
L’Efcaur,., after offering me the loan of fome piftoles, which I accepted, quitted
me alfo, and 1 went to bed at four o’clock ;
\
but the tumult of my blood, and anxiety
for
K
I
1
for onr future fubfiftence, kept me. long awake notwithflanding my fatigue. At length my fpirits being quite exhaufted,
I
I fell afleep, and when I awoke I found it near eleven o’clock. I arofe, impatient to enquire how Manon had pafled the night; when, on my fummoning thefer-vants, they told me that about ten o’clock her brother had called, and taken her out in a fiacre. Though I was not much , pleafed with this party,, and the myfterious ! manner of her going,, I made an effort to check fufpicions. I took, up a book, and paffed an hour and more with a forced patience: but difquiet and un-eafmefs got the better of me ; I could fit . ftill no longer; and going to the window,
I watched every coach, in hopes of feeing it flop; and liftened to every foundthen fickening with anxiety, I began haftily to traverfe’the apartment, confidering whether
I fhouldgo out in fearchof her, tho’ I knew
not
*
not where to go. At length, as I walked with imeafy fteps by-her toilet, ! faw a . letter lying among the boxes and things fhe had deft there : I fnatched it up: it was her hand, addrefled to me.. Trem-bling^with impatience, I tore it open and
read thefe words:
••
#
“ I folemnly proteft to you, my dear “ Chevalier, that you are the only be-loved of my hearty and that it is you “ only I am capable of loving. But “ alas! my dear Des Grieux! in the fitua-“ tion to which we are reduced, fidelity “ would be a ridiculous virtue. Love “ will fly from want, and amidfl hunger and poverty I fhould forget to adore “ you, and deplore the unhappy defliny “ that united us. I love you better than “ life, while I qurt youj I only entreat . “ that you will leave the management of “ our fortune for a little time to me, and

woe be to thofe who are entangled in “ the fnare I fet for them. I go to em-. ploy myfelf in making thee, my Che-“ valier, rkh and happy. My brother “ will acquaint you of the prefent fituation “ of your Manon, to whom the cruel “ neceffity of this parting has coft many tears.”
After having read this extraordinary letter,. I remained in a hate of mind hard to be defcribed. Grief, rage, jealoufy I and lhame, contended with equal violence in my diftraded bofom. Ah! it had been happy for me, if love had not yet had a greater influence there, and predominated even in the chaos of painful fenfa-tions. She loves me 1 cried I; flie dares afllire me of it*, yet fhe abandons me without pity. I, who have facrificed every thing for her, who have denied myfelf the neceflfaries of life to gratify
her

Ah ! who knows fo well as I do, liat if fhe really felt that pain, fhe would rave every diftrefs rather than experi-nce it.
My full heart was thus venting its anguilh a vain exclamations,whcn I was interrupted ly the unexpedted appearance of L’Efcaut.
Nretch! cried I, laying my hand on my fword, vhere is Manon ? whither have you carried ler ? My voice and a<5lion alarmed him, de anfwered, that if fuch was his recep-ion when he came to inform me of the bvice he had done me, he would retire,

and never trouble me again. 1 locked ' the door upon him •, then turning fiercely towards him, bid him not hope to make me again his dupe, and deceive me by chimeras. Either defend yourfelf, Monfieur L’Ef-eaut,- I, or inform me inftantly where 1 can find your filter. Good God! returned he, you are fo. hafty it is impof-fible to tell how to deal with you. I came not only to tsll^ you where fhe is, but to acquaint you with the good fortune that awaits ycu. I defired an immediate explanation. He told me that Manon being unable to bear the thoughts of in-digence, either for herfelf or me, had defired him to introduce her to the acquaintance of ^Monfieur Gevres de.

the perfon of this orphan, whom flie con-fidered as part of herfelf. AfFedled by this account, he has engaged to hire a commodious houfe for you and Manon; (for you may perceive it is yourfelf who is to perfonate the orphan brother:) this houfe he has engaged to furnifh properly; and to fupport it he is to pay to Manon four hundred livres every month, which ac^ cording to tJiy reckoning, will at the end of the year amount to four thoufand eight

Though 1 had agreed to lubmit to this odious arrangement, my heart incef-fantly revolted againft it, 1 met Manon with a mournful and uneafy countenance j and the joy of feeing her again w^as em-poifoned by the thoughts of this fecond ' infidelity.

He has hitherto nothing to boaft of, unlefs of having kiifed my hands an hundred times; it is but reafon-able he Hiould pay for that favor; and confidering his age and his riches, the pearl necklace and other prefents he has

promifed me, together with half the annual penfion, which he is to bring this evening, is not at all too much. I was much better pleafed at the difpofition ibe ihewed to quit her antiquated lover than at the advantage Ihe propofed to make of him. We called in L’Efcaut to inform him of our determination, at whidt he failed not to murmur: but the thoughts of five or fix thoufand livres in ready money, which he hoped to divide ' with us immediately, reconciled him to the proje(5t*j and after a few objections, he confented to all his filler propofed; which was,that we Ihonld fup together with the old gentleman, for two reafons; one was, that fhe might enjoy the ridiculous fcene which my pretended fimplicity would produce; and the other, that the old libertine might not be alone with her. We agreed, that after fupper L’Efcaut and I would retire, and that vvhen De
Malleville
•A
Maileville went to his apartment, Manon,’ inftead of following him, fhould rejoin ns
in a coach in which we were to wait for
%
her.
The hour of fupper arrived, and t)e Maileville did not make us wait for himJ L’Efcaut and his lifter received him in the parlour, where the firft compliment ftie received from her enamoured fwain, was a necklace, ear rings, and bracelets of fine pearl, worth above a thoufand crowns. He then counted out to her, in fhining Louis d*ors, the fum of four thoufand four hundred livres, which was the moiety of the penfion he had agreed to allow her yearly. He feafoned his prefent with an infinite number of compliments in the tafte of the laft age; and Manon could not refufe him a few kifies, which feemed to give her a kind of right to the gifts

i
Ihe was receiving, for which fhe never irb tended to make any other return.
As foon as Manon had dirpofed of her acquifitions in her clofet, L’Efcaut came to introduce me to De Malleville •, and ■gravely leading me by the hand towards liim, bid me make a bow. I took care to
I
make one down to the ground, with the ' air of a boy who learns to dance. Excufe his awkwardnefs, Monfieur, faid I/Efcaut, he has yet feen nothing of the world, and has, as you fee, not profited by the air of Paris the little while he has been in it; but time and obfervation will make him quite another thing: then turning to me, you will have, continued he, the advantage of often feeing Monfieur Gevres de Malle-ville, to whom I have now the honor to introduce you: you muft endeavour to form yourfelf on fo excellent a model. The antient beau feemed not at all to fufped

s
the game we were playing *, but believing’ me to be the raw boy I perfonated, feemed pleafed with my fimplidty, and tapping me on the cheek, told me I was a prett^r lad, and he hoped I fhould take care of myfelf at Paris, which was a bad place for young people; L’Efcaut afTured him f was naturally fo grave and Heady, that I thought of nothing but becoming a priefi',’’
I think him like Manon, faid De Mall'e-ville ; he has very much her air. Oh dear!
y' '
yes Sir, anfwered I, my filter Manon and r are reckoned very much alike, and no
wonderj fmce we are fo nearly related
«
and I alTure you I love my filler Manon like another felf.
All our converfation was nearly in this llile: and Manon, who was the molt de^ termined gigler I ever knew, was feveral' times on the point of fpoiling all by burlt-mg into fits of laughter, which when Iho
H 3	could.
\
eould not wholly conquer {he endeavoured to. excuie I and the old man was too much taken up with her beauty, to criticlfe her behaviour very narrowly.

When it was time to retire, L’Efcaut and I took our leave, and De Malleville went to his chamber; butManon, leaving him for a moment on fome pretext which ihe eafily found, ran down to us before we loft the door, which we opened filently, and then walked to a coach which waited for us a few doors below, into which we got with all poiTible expedition, and in a few moments were in a diftant quarter of the town.
Tho’ in my eyes this appeared no other than an a6lual robbery, I did not think it the moft fcandalous adtion of which I had ever been guilty: the money 1 had acquired at play feemed to me
much
much more unworthily gained. But were equally unhappy in both; and Providence determined that neither the one nor the other ftiould procure us any dura^ ble advantage,
Gevres de Malleville foon difcovered how we had duped him. I know not what meafures he took that evening to find our retreat v. but he had too much credit and power to permit us to efcape him long;, while we, trufting to the im« menfity o£ the town, and the diftance we were at from the quarter he inhabited, believed; ourfelves in the moft perfedt fecurity. He was however foon informed where we were; and not only fo, but he learned v/ho I was, the life T had led at Paris, the eonnedtion of Manon with '
De Beaumanoir, and the manner in which Ihe had quitted him; in a word, all the fcandalous part. of our hiftory: and he
H 4	thero-^ ^
'<rf
thereupon took the refolution o£ having us arrefted, an.d treated like lharpers and cheats.
#
It was about nine o’clock in the morfir ' ing, but we were ftill in bed, when aa Exempt of the Police, and a party of the Marechauflee came into our chamber. They feized immediately on a cafket that contain,ed our money, or rather the money and prefents of De Malleville; and having made us rife, and drefs ourfelves with the utmoft hafte, they
conduced us to two coaches which were
%
in waiting. Into one of them th^y put
i	V
Manon, and me into the other 5 and
without any apologies drove me to St.
(
Lazare.
Thofe only who have experienced a fudden and dreadful reverfe of fortune, dan judge of my diilradlion and defpair!
I was,

V
I was torn from Manon, to all appearance:-forever; and our guards had the inhumanity to refufe me leave to embrace and fpeak a few words fo her before they dragged her away. With equal cruelty, they were obftinately filent as to whither I was going, or whither fhe was carried: and probaWy it was happy I was ignorant of it; for had f then known the terrible fate that awaited her, I believe it would have deprived me of my rgafon,, if not of my life,
/
My beloved Manon then was thus fnatched from me, and carried to a place which I cannot name without horror even at this diftance of time. She, who would have been miftrefs of the world if all.
i
men had had my eyes and my heart, was Ihut up in a dreary cell, alone, where flie was every day to fulfil a certain talk of-coarfe work, on v^hich condition only Ihe
H 5	was

‘
%
was to receive a fmall portion of difgiiO:* ing food. But of all this I was long
O	O
ignorant; while I endured myfelf many months of clofe and vigorous imprifon-
ment.
V
The place of my deftination I knew not till I faw myfelf at the gate of St. Lazare; and. at that mom.ent death would liave been preferable to my feelings. I had conceived dreadful ideas of the place; and the horror with which it infpired me, augmented when the guard again fearched my pockets to aflfure themfelves I carried no offenfive weapon. The Superior, who had been apprized of my arrival, appeared to receive me. Father, cried I, no indignity: I will lofe my life rather than fnffer the flighted to be of-
f
fered me. No, Sir, anfwered the father, none are intended : you will a^ reafon-ablv, and we fhall be well fatisfied with

each
i
r
each other. He then defired me to follow him up flairs, which I did without re-fiftance; the guard ftiil following till we came to an upper chamber, when the Superior made them a fign to retire..
As foon as the door was ihut upon us,
I addrefled myfelf to him.. Well, Sir, I -am your prifoner •, .what do you intend to do with me? He anfwered that he was happy to hear ^ me fpeak calmly: :that it was his inclination, as well as. his duty, to endeavour at leaft to reinfpire me with thofe fentiments of religion and redlitude, which the heat of youth, and eager purfuit of pleafure, had made me forget; and that he did not doubt,. but that by a little attention to his advice, and exhortations, I Ihould foon be reflored to my reafon, and find even that folitude capable of bellowing pleafure and >——-1 hallily interrupted him: talk not to me, father,
cried
V
t
cried I, of pleafure; you know not that the only happinefs I am capable of tailing is torn from me. Oh, you are miftaken,, returned the father, in his turn interrupting me: I know your prefent attachment; but reafon will recover its empire over a young man, well, born,, and well dlfpofed. This anfwe? made me apprehend' he was acquainted with my whole hiftory, and perhaps my, name and family. I defired to know how ,far his knowledge of my affairs went.^ He told me he knew all.
This ftroke was the crtieleff I had yet fuffered. A fhower of tears fell from my eyes, and the mofl frightful defpair took poffeflion of my heart. The thoughts of becoming the ridicule of my acquaintance, and the difgracd of my family,.
covered me with fname and confufion;
, / .
and.

, ^
N
/
and I pafled eight days in a ftate of depref-fion, or rather of defpair bordering or^ ‘ madnefs j being incapable of attending to any thing but the opprobium and infamy with which this imprifonment covered me,-Even love itfelf loft a part of its influence j-and 1 thought lefs of Manon than of the debafement I fuffered by her means, Grief^ confufion, and regret were the reigning, paffions of my foul, and abforbed for a time every other fentiment. The deep melancholy in which thefe cruel refledliona plunged me, interefted the Superior in my favor: he even began to apprehend fatal confequences, and thought it necelTary to treat me with gentlenefs and indulgence,! He vifited me feveral times every day; and took me often with him into the garden,, where he gave fcope to his zeal, and Ipared not pious exhortations and advice, which I received with fo much mildnefs, that he conceived the utmoft hopes of my reforma-tion.
Your
A
Your natural difpofition, faid he, appears to me to be fo gentle and good, that I cannot comprehend how you have been drawn into the vices and diforders of which you are accufed.. It is aftonifhing to me, that with fuch a temper you fhould have given yourfelf up to a courfe of life fo licentious. It is ftill more aftonifhing, that having once been involved in it, and ref-cued only by force, ,you lliould fo wil- ■ iingly attend to the advice and inftrucftions , I give you.. If this is the effedl of repen-; tance, you are a.ifignal inftance of the,' mercy of God; .if it is owing to your, dif-pofition, I have every reafon to hope, that; with fuch advantages we fhall not have occafion to keep you here long, before you . will reaflfume your former regular morals, and be reftored to your family and your refpedtability. I was delighted to find the good father had this opinion of me. I determined to augment his confidence by a
*•
behaviour
•
behaviour conformable to the idea he eemed to have formed of. my charafler *,
vhich appeared the only means to fhorten
ny imprifonment.
I afked for books •, and.he was furprifed,' ?hen he gave me the choice of feveral, hat I fixed on the mofl: ferions; and I Ifeded to devote myfelf to the ftndy of bem with the moft earneft attention: thus y every means endeavouring to confirm itn in the opinion of my repentance.
All this however was but pretence : with hame I acknowledge that I ftudied the noft refined hypocrify. But the melan* holy hours in which I was alone, I palTed lot in reading, but in lamenting my cruel leftiny, and curfing my confinement and hofe through whofe means I was confined. iVhen the firft fliock at finding myfelf tnown was over, love re-afllimed its empire :
m
pire: the lovely figure of Manon agaih. haunted me, and the uncertainty of her fate unceafingly tormented me. Sometimes I fancied fhe was become the miilrefs i
I
of Gevres de Malleville; for I was far from fuppofing he had treated her as rigo-roufly as he had done me, but believed that he had put me into prifon only tO' fecure her to himfelf. Days and nights paffed, which thefe mortifying ideas made appear infupportably long; but having no other hopes of efcaping but by means of ' the Superior, 1 fttidied his looks and manner towards me with the moft watchful attention, and found that I daily gained on his efteem; and I redoubled my endeavours to encreafe this favorable difpofition, con-fidering him as the arbitrator of my def-

tiny.,

I foon had the pleafure of finding my-felf entirely eftablilhed in his affedtion v |
and,
, #
/
and being then convinced he was every way difpofed to ferve me, I one day took occafion to allc him if my enlargement depended on him. He anfwered, that tho* the power was not abfolutely his, yet he hoped and believed, that on the favorable report of my condu6t during my confinement, Monfieur Gevres de Malleville, at whofe inftancc the Lieutenant of the Police had confined me, would confent to my releafe. May I not hope, afked I, mildly, that two months clofe imprifon-ment will appear to Monfieur de Malle-ville ,a fulficient; expiation of the offence I have given him? The Superior replied, that if I defired it he would try what wag
m
to be done ; and I fo preflingly entreated him to undertake this good office, that he confented to fet about it immediately. Two days afterwards he informed me, that his reprefentations had fuch efiedf
on Monfieur Gevres de Malleville> that
ho
/
I
he not onljr feemed difpofed to reftore me to liberty, but had even exprefied an inclination to be better acquainted with me, and propofed vifiting me in my confinement. Tho’ I did not much enjoy the thoughts of this interview, I was rejoiced at the general tenor of the good father’s
(
report*	'
I
De Malleville in a day or two afterwards-came to St. Lazare, and was brought into my room by the Superior, who then left us alone. His manner did not now appear fo ridiculous as when I faw him before at the fatal fupper which coft me fo dear. He talked to me fenfibly enough on the diforderly life into which I had been drawn; and I fuppofe by way of juftifying himfelf for his own loofe con-du6t, faid that tho* fome . indulgencies were permitted to the frailty of human nature, yet that cheating and deceit, for
which'.
k.
t
which there could be no excnfe, were of fuch evil tendency, and fo inimical to fociety, that they could not be too fe* .merely punilUpd. He feemed fatisfied with :he attention with which I liftened to limj and I continued to bear with pati-:nce his raillery on my relationihip [to ^anon, and on the little chapelles which /e had told him I took fuch pleafure in naking, and of which he faid I had ertainly made a great number at Sti ^azare.
Had he flopped here all had been yell; but he went on to fay, that un-loubtedly Manon had alfo had abundance )f time for the fame pious employment It the hofpital.^ Tho* my blood curdled n my veins at the word holpital, I had

yet
yet fo much prefence of mind as to de(ire an explanation. An explanation! Oh ho! cried he; what, you do not know then, that flie has been in the hofpital thefe two months, where doubtlefs Ihe has
edified as much as you have done at St> Lazare,
Had I been at that moment afllircd of
, >
eternal imprifonment, or had death itfelf in its moft horrid form been before my eyes, I could not have conquered the violent emotion that poflefieci me at thefe words. I threw myfelf upon him in a tranfport of rage that deprived me of half my ftrength; but I had enough to throw him to the ground, where I knelt over him *, and he was very near being ftrangled, when the noife of his fall, and outcries, which I had hardly left him breath to make, brought the Superior and feveraf monks into the room; and they delivered, him from my fury with lefs difficulty,,

IS paffion had deprived me of my breath md my fenfes. Oh eternal juftice of Heaven! cried I; fliail I live a moment ifter fo infamous an event? Again I flew
o
It the inhuman monller, who had done ivorfe tlian aflalhnate me •, but they prevented my feizing him, and kept us afunder; while the frenzy of my paffion exceeded all imag;ination.
/
An agony of rage fo violent, the occa-fion of which was quite unknown to them, appeared' fo extraordinary, that they continued looking in amaze at each other. While De Malleville was adjuft-ing his wig and cravat, and full of terror, and vexation at having been fo ill treated, he ordered the Supeiior to confine me more rigoroufly than ever, and to puniffi me with the difcipline given to the mofi; refradory inhabitants of their houle. No,
Sir, replied the Superior, it is not in that
manner

tnanner we can think of conducing onri felves towards a perfon of fnch high birth as the Chevalier des Grieux: he is fo pro* perly behaved, and of manners fo gentle, that it muft be fomething very nmifiial that has driven him to this extremity with you. This anfwer entirely difconcerted De Malleville, who went haftily away, muttering that he knew how to make both the Superior and the Chevalier des Grieux fiibmit to his power. The Monks followed him out; and the Superior being left alone with me, conjured me to tell him immediately the occafion of this unaccountable fcene.
Oh, Father! cried I, weeping like a child, conceive the moft execrable cruelty! imagine the moft inhuman outrage I and you will ftill be unable to guefs at any thing fo infamous as the injury I have received from that old villain. My heart is
torn
f
V«	•	mm
torn in pieces: I Ihall never recover it.
I will tell you all: you are good and will pity me. I then gave him a fummary detail of my long and unconquerable paf-lion for Manon j the flourilhing ftate of our fortune when we were robbed by our fervants *, the offers De Malleville had made to my miftrefs, together with the unfortunate manner in which his amour had ended.
\
Tho’ I kept to the general line of fa6l$, I own I threw the moft favorable light 1
tD
could on the parts we had a6ted. You fee, father, faid I, the fource of that extraordinary zeal which De Mallevijle has Ihewn for my reformation; and he has had intereft enough to have us fhut up to gratify his revenge. I forgive him the injuries done to my own perfon •, but my Manon ! the deareft part of myfeif! her whom I adore, in the hofpitall to hear
that
X
1.	J	i
Aat he has put her there, like the moft abandoned and incorrigible of women! oh ! it is too much ! where fhall I find firength of mind to fupport myfelf under the fhame and vexation that overwhelms me!
The good father feeing me thus in defpair, undertook to confole me. He told me he never underftood my adventure in the manner I now related it: that he knew 1 had lived in a diforderly manner; but always imagined that fome attachment i to my family, or intimacy with my father; had engaged Monfieur de Malleville to take part in my affairs; nay, that De Malleville himfelf had fo explained it to
r
him. But that as what I now told him
y
very much altered the cafe, ,he did, not doubt but that the account he would go and give of it to the Lieutenant of the Police, would immediately procure me my liberty.
The

The father then afked me, why fince friy family had not occafioned my confine-ment, I had not informed them of my fit-nation, and folicited their interference to procure my releafe ? I anfwered that I had been prevented by the vexation fuch a difgraceful circurnftance would give my father, and the reproaches it would draw * upon me from all my connexions. At the clofe of our converfation, he promifed to,go inftantly to the Lieutenant of the Police, if it be only, faid hCj to prevent fomething yet more malicious from Gevres de Malleville, who went from hence in a very ill humour, and who has intereft enough to be a very dangerous enemy. I waited his return in the ftate of mind of a cririiinal who expeXs his fentence. The idea of Manon at the hofpital, brought with it a thoufand daggers to my foul: the accounts I had heard of that dreadful abode occurred to me in all its horrors, and threw me into
I	an
L 170 J
an agony of mind not to be defcribed. So determined was 1 to relieve her, that had no other means offered of getting out -of St. Lazare, I fliould certainly have fired the. building rather than have been longer ■confined in it. Then I ran over in my mind every poffibility of efcape, if the Lieutenant of the Police fhould refufe to fet me free; and after canvaffing many different places, faw none on which I could certainly depend: while I felt too certainly, that to attempt it and fail would make my captivity yet ftridter.
/
I thought of every friend on whom I could depend for affiftance; but how inform them of my fituation ? At length I believed I had found one expedient that gave a ray of hope: but before I had time to digefl my plan the Superior returned, and in his countenance I read
that his embafly had been fuccefslefs. I
have
»
L */* J
have fpoken, faid he, to the Lieutenant of the Police, but my application was too late: De Maileville had prepolTefled. him fo ftrongly againft you, that he was on the point of fending me orders to confine you more ftridly, and to fubjed you to harlher methods; but when I related to' him the true ftate of your cafe, he feemed very much foftened •, and fmiling at the libertinifm of old De Maileville, he told me that tho’ your offence was much leffened in his opinion by this explanation, yet you muft notwithftanding fiibmit to fix months longer imprifon-ment; in which, added he, I more willingly confent to gratify Monfieur de Maileville,^ as fuch a penance cannot fail of having a falutary effe61: on the morals ^ of the Chevalier des Grienx. He ordered me, however, to treat you with decency and good manners, of which I afifured
I 2	him

him you fliould have no reafon to com*-plain.
While the good father was fpeaking,
I had time to confider that I fliould only expofe myfelf to the hazard of failing in my defign, if I expreflTed too violent a defire for my enlargement. I thereforCj with all the tranquility 1 could afiumc, anfwered, that it was a great alleviation of my misfortune to find I pofTefied his friendfhip; confoled with which, I mull fubmit as patiently as I could to a longer; refidence at St. Lazare*, but that another circumftance in which it was in his power to indulge me, would alTifl: in foftening the hardfhip of confinement, which was, ' that he would inform a worthy friend of mine, an ecclefiaftic of St. Sulpice, where
I
I was, and permit him fometimes to vifit me. This favor the father granted without hefuation, and 1 need not tell you it
was

vas my friend Tiberge that I meant t »ot that I hoped through his immediate iTidance to procure my liberty, but I ntended ufing him as the remote inftru-ncnt of mv defign, without even his own mowledge..
\
My projed was to write to L’Efcaiit, ,nd engage our common friends in my efcue. The firft difficulty was to conveys ny letter to him., Tiberge I was fure ?ould undertake to deliver nothing to he brother of Manon; therefore I con-rived to put my letter to him into ano-her which I directed to a very creditable radefman whom I knew; and this I bought Tiberge would carry for me mhout fcruple: As it was abfolutely, leceffiary for me to fee L’Efcaut, I da-ired him to come to St. Lazare,. and en-[uire for me, in the name of my elder rather, who might with probability be
I‘3	fuppofed
%
«
fuppofed to have come to Paris, on hearing of my fituation. The Superior informed Tiberge of my defire to fee him,
r
and he came immediately. This valuable friend had not loft fiQ;ht of me: he
o
knew my laft adventure, and that I was at St. Lazare; and he was not forry for a difgrace that he hoped would be the means of reftoring me to reafon.
%
Our converfation was held in the moft perfedl friendfhip. He wifhed to know the fituation of my mind, and I opened myfelf to him without referve on every thing except my defign of efcaping. Tis not to your eyes, my dear Tiberge, faid I, that I fhall endeavour to appear what I am not.

favorably; you fee me fuch as I left you

Ah! Tlberge! anfwered I, how eafily you vanquifh where you are not oppofcd. Let me reafon a little in my turn.

You cannot fupport fuch a paradox. This purfuit then, the fatis-fadlion of which you boaft, is embittered with a thoufand calamities thro’ which you are to pafs to felicity: if the hope of that felicity can fo far influence the imagination as to make you find pleafure even in thofe fufFerings which you think will lead you to itj, why do you treat as fenfelefs

The road I own ia rugged and painful,but the expedtation ofar^ -riving fooner or later at the point I aim at,^ throws a degree of fweetnefs into my fuffer-^ ingsj and one moment paff: with her over--pays for all I go thro’, to obtain it. Thus ifi appears to me that my purfuit is as rear fonable as your’s, or that the reafon is rather the ftrongeft on my fide; fince the happinefs I hope for is nea'r, your’s distant *, mine is known and aflTured, your’s . of a kind unknown, or afcertained only,
through faith.
/
Tiberge was frightened .at this mode of-reafoning. He ftepped back from me

with the air of a man who beholds a noxious infed in his path; telling me, with the moff: ferious air I had ever feen

The comparifon, faid he, which you afFe6f to make between the calamities into which an irregular and diforderly palTion has plunged yon, and thofe which religious and pious perfons have endured on account of their faith, is an abfurd and an impious idea;

I fpeak of the power which we have to fupport in either cafe, pain and fuf*-fering. We can judge only by expe- -rience: how many apoftates are there from virtue; how few from true love. You will perhaps on your part alledge, ,., that tho’ there is fometimes a great degree -of pain, felf-denial, and uneafinefs attends the pradice of virtue, yet it is not always fo: that the pious are no longer ex-pofed to the danger of being martyrs to their religious principles, and that many virtuous perfons live in the utmofl tranquility and content. To which I reply, that neither does love always render his
votaries
f*
*
votaries unhappy j but that there are thofe wh^ enjoy all the gifts of fortune together with his faireft favors, which to fufccptible minds includes the greateft of fublunary blcflings.
Theconclufion of my difcourfe reflored Tiberge’s good humour. He allowed that my argument had fomething like reafon in it; but again he objefted to my fyftem, by faying, fince you mull long fince have feen that Mademoifelle Manon does not conftitute your felicity, but occafions you to fufFer remorfc, difappointment, and dif-
«
grace, why not, fince you fay that any degree of pain may be borne for an adequate recompenfe, why not by one great effort difengage yourfelf from her, in hopes of acquiring by it a right to that felicity which you acknowledge you believe may exceed the happinefs you propofe with her. Ah 1 my dear friend ! replied I, it is there
I feci
t
I feel my deplorable weaknefs : I fee hov/1 fliould ad, but where fliall I find ftrength to do it? what reafon, what rhetoric will make me forget the charms of Manon ?
O
God forgive me ! cried Tiberge, I believe I am talking to a Janfenift. 1 know not what I am, returned I ; I hardly know what I ought to be; but I feel but too fen-fibly the force of their fyftem.
This converfation ferved to awaken in the breaft of Tiberge all his former pity. He found more weaknefs than obftinacy in my unhappy condud ♦, and his kindnefs now returning with all its ulual warmth, difpofed him'in the fequel to afford me that Ibare of affedionate attention, without which I muft have perifhed in the ut-mofl mifery.
I did not dare difcover to him the leafl lymptom of an inclination to efcape from
St. Lazare 5
St. Lazare; but gave him the letter I had already written and fealed, deliring him to deliver it to the perfon to whom it was di-redled, to whom I eafily found a pretence for writing. He carried it pundlually j and before evening L’Efcaut had received that which was inclofed, diredled to him. The next day he appeared at the gate ; and faying, as I had diredled, that he was my elder brother, was admitted to my room, I faw him enter with extreme joy. Let us not lofe a moment,-faid I as I fecured the door; tell me firft what you know of Manon, and then advife with me on the means of regaining my freedom.
He aflured me he had not feen his lifter lince the evening he parted from us together after our flight from Gevres de Malle-ville, and that it was not till after long enquiries he had difcovered her fate and
mine 5 but that as foon as he knew Ihe
was
• •
was at the hofpital, he had applied there repeatedly for leave to fee her, which had been conftantly and peremptorily denied him. In regard to your deliverance, continued L’Efcaut, it is much lefs eafy than you may fuppofe. Morizet, Flamarens, and myfelf, pafled the evening of yefterday in examining the outward walls of your prifon; and we fear, that as your apartment looks into a court furrounded by other buildings, and is befides on the third ftair cafe, it will be difficult, if not impoffible to get you from thence by any attempt we could make from without. You muft imagine fome expedient from within.
*Tis impradlicable, anfwered I; I have examined every thing fince I have been -indulged by the Superior with the liberty of walking in the galleries, and am not locked into my room. All the ftaircafes
are
are fecnred by thick doors, which are carefully fhut night and day, with fuch ftrength and precaution, that. to. efcape feems almoft impoflible. But ftay;. a fudden thoughts ftrikes me: could you not bring me a piftol, fince you pafs the porters unfearched and unfufpeded. Nothing more eafy, replied L’Efcaut, but who would you kill ? I have fo litde intention to kill any one, faid I, that the piftol need not even be loaded. Bring it to-morrow, and fail, not to be, with our two friends,, oppoftte the door of St.,Lazare between ten and eleven tomorrow night; I think I fhall be able to join you.
He prefled me to tell him how I-intended to proceed j but I anfwered that fuch an enterprize could only , appear well imagined after it had fucceeded. I then
dcfired him to fliorten his vifit, to avoid
all
aii fufpicion, and that he might find nd: difficulty in being admitted the next day. They accordingly fufFered him to enter the fecond time as eafily as the firft. His aiP was grave and compofed, and nobody would have fuppofed from his appearance he was otherwife than- an honeft man.
As foon as 1 was furnifiied with the in-ftrument with which I hoped to effeduate
I
my releafe, I hardly doubted of fuccefs.
V*
The enterprize, was hazardous and daring j but of what was I not capable, animated by motives fo powerful;' Since I was permitted to walk in the galleries, I had ob-ferved, that every evening the porter, after having locked all the doors, carried the keys to the Superior ; foon after which a profound filence reigned in the houfe, which evinced, that every body was retired to reft. There was a ftone paflage which led from my room to, that where the Su-
perior;
r
/
perior lay: my refolntion was to force his keys from him hy threats, and to opem i the doors and go into the ftreet: and hav--ing thus determined I waited for night.
I
A little pafl nine o’clock the porter came as uiiial with the keys : .1 then re--mained quiet another hour, ’till the deep filence of the houfe perfuaded me the monks and fervants were afleep; them foftly opening my door, 1: went flowly, along the paflage, with my candle in one. hand and the piftol in the other, and tapped, gently at the door of the Superior’s room, to awaken him with as little noife as pofii-ble. The fecond time 1 rapped he heard me; and fuppofing that fome monk was ill, and wanted alTiftance, he got up to open it. He had however the precaution to afk who it was, and what was wanted ?
I anfwered in a .plaintive tone, and like
one in pain, that it was I. Ha! is it you,
mv..’
\
i
my fon ? fald the good man, opening the-door ; what brings you here fo late ? I went in i and going to the other end of the room with him, I declared to him in a. few words that I would remain no longer at St. Lazare : the night, father, is a convenient time for me to efeape, and I expedt of your friendlhip either that you will open the doors for me or give me the keys that I may open them for myfelf. This ad-drefs could mot fail to dagger him: he looked at me with furprife : but as I had no time to lofe, I told him that tho’ I was . fenfible of all his friendlhip, yet liberty being the mod precious of all bleflings,. and what I was mod unjudly deprived of,
I was determined at all hazards to regain it •, and lead he fhould raife his voice for help, I die wed him under my waidcoatan infallible argument in favor of filence. How! my fon, exclaimed he, darting at fight of the pidol, would you kill me then
in
/
‘	A
m return for all the kindnefs I have fhewn
*
you? God forbid! my good father! an-fwered I you will not drive" me to fuch a fatal extremity : but I will, I mull be free ; and am fo determined to attempt it at all rifques, that if I fail thro’ your means I cannot anfwer for the confequence of my rage and defpair. But my dear fon, faid he again,, all pale and trembling, what have I done ? why Ihould you wifh my death? No! no! J cried, with yet more impatience, 1 wilh not your death, but to procure my liberty.-^I will hefitate.at nothing.^—Don’t force me to an. a6jt of def-peration.—Open the doors, and I am your fincereft friend. Then feeing the keys lay on a table near his bed, I eagerly feized them, and infilled upon his following me with as little noife as polTible. When we got out of the room, I made.him go .before me, and open the firft door on the llairr ca,fe: as he did it, he, repeated, with , a
«
'	. :L i«:9 J
t
figh, ah ! my fon ! from you, who would have believed this ? No noife, no noife, father, was all my anfwer.
At length we arrived at a fort of barrier
t
which is before the great door of the pri-fon. and I believed myfelf already free-,
I was behind the Superior, with my candle and my piftol *, but while he was unbarring the grated door, one of the porter’s fervants, who lay in a little room near it, was awakened by the noife, and put his head out at the door of his room to fee what was the matter: the father embraced this opportunity to flop me, and unhappily
called to the fellow to feize me. He was
/
a ftrong rafcal; and flew at me without he-
#
fitation. *Twas nov/no time for delibera- . * tion : I fired my piflol, and he fell. See, father, fee what you have forced me to: but come, unbar the door inftantly, faid 3, rufhing towards it. He dared not re»
fufe.
1	J
fufe-^The door opened-^—I got out~and a few fteps from the door I found L’Efcaut and his two companions waiting as they had promifed me.
We walked haftily away. L’Efcaut ' aflced me if I had not fired the piflol ? It was your fault, anfwered F: why did you bring it loaded ? Had I not done lo, however, I had probably been fixed at St. Lazare for fome years
As foon as we were out of that quarter
N
of the town, and thought ourfelves in fafety, we went to a traiteurs, where I eat heartily after the meagre fare I had been kept on at St. Lazare. But far from yielding to the pleafure my newly acquired liberty might have infpired, I refleded with new bitternefs on the imprifonment of Manon, and fuffered for her more than
for myfelf. We muft deliver Manon from
the
$
1 I9I J
the hofpital, faid I to her brother, at al events: I defired my own freedom with no other view. You will certainly aflift me ; and as to myfelf, 1 will lofe my life
rather than fail.
!
L’Efcaut, who did not want fenfe or Caution, reprefented to me the extreme •hazard I incurred by entering too precipitately into fo rafli an adventure. Confider, faid he, how much roife your efcape from St. Lazare will make, efpecially after the accident that happened on your getting out. The Lieutenant of the Police will certainly fet on foot a ftrid enquiry after you : remember that his fearch is riot eah-ly evaded ; and that fituated as you are, it would be of fatal confequence to fall into his power. If therefore you would avoid fomething infinitely worfe than your im-prifonment at St. Lazare, you muft do nothing ralhly, but at leaft let fome days
pafs,

L	j
■pafs, and the firfl: outcry occafioped by your efcape fubfide, before you attempt to-refcue my fifter. This advice was undoubtedly prudent; but it agreed ill with my impetuous temper, and more impetus-ous paflion. All I would promife was to pafs the next day in his apartment; where he lluit me up •, and I then went to bed, as =I -greatly wan-ted repofe^ and lay till late in the day.
As foon as I was refreflied by fieep, I began to confider of the means of liberating Manon, whofe prifon I knew was infi-■ -nitely more difficult to efcape from than mine had been. Force I knew would there be ufelefs: artifice alone could fuc-ceed. But the Goddefs of Invention her-felf would have been puzzled how to fet
about it. I knew fo little how to begin, that I was obliged to poftpone forming any plan till I could by fome means inform
myfelf
s
%
L	J
iiyfelf of the interior arrangement of the lofpital.
As foon as returning night made my go-'
0
ng out lefs unfafe, I defired L’Efcaut to iccompany me to the hofpital, where we entered into converfation with one of the sorters, who feemed to be an intelligent 'eilow. I pretended to be a ftranger who lad heard much of the excellent regula-dons of the hofpital, and I queftioned him in the moft minute particulars of its [Tianagement, and led him from one qucf-tion to another till we began to difcourfe of 'he governors, whofe names and rank I iehred to be informed of. The anfwers be made gave me the glympfe of an idea that might, I thought, be brought to per-feftion. I alked if any of the governors be had named had children ? He faid that be did not know what family fomc of them had, but that Monficur the Count de StJ
K	Orfeuil
^ ^	* ••
L	J
j
I
'Orfeuil had, a fon, Monfieur de Tironx, who was about one or two and twenty, and -had often been at the hofpital with his father. This was enough : I broke off our converfation 1 and as we walked towards
s
T.’Efcaut’s lodgings I communicated to Tim the fcheme I had formed.
I	I
I imagine, faid 1, that Monfieur de Tironx, rich and of high birth, is in a certain courfe of pleafures like other young men of his age and fituation. He does . not, I imagine, diflike the fair fex, and will hardly rcfufe his fervicc in a Iqye affair : I mean to intereft him in the libera-
w
tion of Manon.' If he is a man of gene-rohty and fentiment, thofe motives alone will engage him to aflift me j but even if he is lefs nobly minded, he will at leaf! be moved by the melancholy fituation of a beautiful young woman, and may be tempted to befriend her, if it be only in
hopes
C «9S 3
s
opes of fliaring her favors. Therefore I hll go to him to-morrow; and I feel fo avorable a prefentiment of fuccefs, that I m already much eafier than I was. L’Ef^ ant acknowledged my plan to be a good ►ne, and that much might be expefled rom it i and confoled with that flattering lope, I pafled the night more eaflly than ’ had done f he preceding one.
In the morning, I drefled myfelf as well IS my prefent indigence would allow, and
went in a fiacre to the houfe of Monfieur
(
de Tiroux. I enquired for the young gentleman, who was at firll rather furprifed at being addrefled by a perfect ftranger : his countenance and manner ^ were however inch as immediately perfuaded me I might truft him, and I explained in a few words the requeft 1 had to make ; and to engage every motive in my favor, I deferibed the beauty and merit of my miftrefs fuch as
K 2	could
\
\
I	♦ jy	'1
'
could be only equalled by the violence of my palTion for her. He told me that tho*
*
he had never feen Mademoifelle Manon, he had heard of her extraordinary attractions *, at leaft if it was the fame who had been put into the hofpital by Gevres de Malleville. I doubted not but that he -was informed of the part I had taken in that affair; and to gain his confidence by mine, I recounted the whole exadly as it happened.
Now Sir, faid 1, my life, and what is infinitely dearer to me, the intereft of my love, is in your hands. 1 have no referves to you : not only becaufe I am affured you are of a noble nature, but becaufe the re-femblance of our ages makes me hope our inclinations may alfo be alike. He appeared affedled with this infiiance of candour, and anfwered like a man who knew the world, as well as like one pofTeffed of
ihofe
«
kofe fentiments which the world feklont ^ives, but often takes away. He did not tlTure me he could reftore Manon to me, jecaufe at his age his power and influence :ould not be great j but he promifed to procure me at leaft a fight bf her, and to-lo his utmoft to give her back to my arms.-! was. more fatisfied with thefe moderate . 3romifes than, if he had abrolutely afilired ne of fucccfs: there was a modeft difH-lence of his own weight, mingled with his-ifilirances of fervice, which charmed me j-md I began to hope every thing from his. mdeavours..
To give me an opportunity of feeing" Manon was fuch a favor as I thought the fervices of my whole life too little to re-qifite. I exprelfed to him what I felt on-this occafion in fo lively a manner, as per-fuaded him that ingratitude at leafl: was-
K 3	not-
jiGt among my vices. We became imme- 1
diately on a footing of friendlhip; without
any other attradion than the natural ten- i
dency that one generous open hearted
young man has to love another of the
fame difpoiition. But my new friend
carried his attention much farther thaa
moft men would have done on fo fhort an
acquaintance: judging as I only fo lately
efcaped from St. Lazare that my finances
were not in a flourilhing ftate, he offered
me his purfe, and even preffed me to
accept it. I refufed it, but teftified my I
nncere gratitude. ’Tis too much. Sir!
faid Ij if with this uncommon goodnefs, j
/ • ' ' you procure me the happinefs of feeing
Manon once more, I fhall be eternally
attached to you; but if you reflore to

Before we parted we agreed on the time and place where we were to meet again. He had the goodnefs to delay it no longer than till the next afternoon, I-waited for him in a coffee-hoiife, where at the appointed time he joined me, and we went together, to', the hofpital. My knees trembled,, and my breath grew .{hort as I crofled: the court; fo that it was with dijfHculty I fupported myfelf. Shall I then,, faid I,, fee again the idol of my foul;, the object of fo much inquietude; of fo many tears! Grant me,, oh heaven! ftrength enough to fee her once more, and I think I could die con--tented,
Monfieur de Tiroux; addrefled himfelf to the principals of the houfe, who with the moll officious attention offered him all the civilities in their power. He named the young woman he wanted to fee; and
K 4	' they
i
they dire(5led a fervant to fhew him the quarter where her chamber was, and to conduct him to it. This man, whofe bufmefs it was to attend a certain number , of rooms in one of the wards, walked be-fore ns, with a key of a frightful fize in his hand. As we went along, I aflced
him how the young perfon whom we
, ■ !
were going to fee had palTed her time fince fhe had been in that difmal place ?
He told us, that flie had ever been as gentle as an angel, and had never fpoken a harfh or peevifli word fince he had ferved her. That during the firfl: fix weeks, fhe had wept continually, but
for fome time fhe had appeared to be better reconciled to her deftiny, and was employed	at	her	work	the	whole	day; '	;
and after fulfilling	her	taflc,	fhe	read.	I	*

We v/ere now within a few fteps of heif

I was obliged to flop. Conceiving from.
the fenfations 1 felt myfelf, how violent.

The good DeTiroux employed himfelf in confoling ns; and nothing did itfoeffec-tually as the promife he made us of exr -erting his utmoft efforts to put an end to our fufferings. - He advifed us not to continue together too long, that no fufpicion might arife to prevent our meeting again.
But he found it difficult to make us relifli > this prudent advice: Manon could not determine to let me depart, but continued holding my hand and my coat. Ah! why do you leave me ? faid ffie : alas f who Ihall alfure me I fhall fee you again ? I do, anfwered de Tirouxj I promife to bring him again: and as to the place, it is no longer the hofpital, an houfe of puniffi-ment and mortification; it is the court of yerfailles 5 the abode of beauty and ele-

I thought it would be proper to give fomething to the fervant who waited upon her, to engage him to ferve her more attentively. It happened that this young man had a good heart, and more fenti*-ment than ufually belongs to his flation. The affecting interview he had been wit-jiefs to, as well perhaps as the beauty and gentlenefs of Manon, interefted him for her j and a Louis d’or which I gave hinrij' compleated the prepoiTelTion he had[ conceived in ray favour.,
Sir, faid he, taking me on one fide, if you will promife to take me into your fer-vice, or otherwife recompenfe me for the lofs of my place here, I believe I could find a way to put Mademoifelle Manon into your hands. It may eafily be fup-

pofed that I lillened eagerly to this dif^' GOiirfe; and tho’ I had nothing in fa6l that I could command, I promifed him. more than he afl-ced for: indeed 1 knew I could at any time fufficiently repay fuch a perfon for his fervices, and therefore gave him without hefitation the moft lavifli affurances of reward. I afl<ted him by what means he thought he could fet Mademoifelle Manon at liberty ? By the mofl fimple in the world, anfwered he : Ifhall let.her out of her chamber, and condud her to the ftreet door, where you mull be ready, in a coach to receive her., I objeded to this the hazard there would be in her croffina: the courts and galleries: he owned there would be fome ; but in thefe cafes, faid he, one mull hazard fomething, and I think in this the rilk islefs than you feeni to apprehend.
Charmed
#
Charmed with an hope fo flattering, I' communicated what, the man had faid, to > de Trioux, who had abfented himfclf a mom^ent to fpeak to a perfon in another part of the houfe : But he-was not fo fan-guine as I was: he allowed that there.
f
might be a bare poflibility of her efcaping by this means j but that on the other hand, the probabilities of failing were numerous j and if fhe was detedted in the attempt, fhe mufl; be lofl: for ever. Befldes, continued he, if you fliould fucceed in getting her. away, you mufl: inftantly quit Paris ; fo^ to conceal yourfelves will be impolTible. A' man alone may eafily evade all fearch, but with a woman fo remarkably beautiful as Manon, it will be impoffible toi. elude the Arid: fearch that will be made for you both.
However juft this reafoning was, the hope of recovering Manon was fuperior to
every
every fear,, and worth every hazard. For--give me, faid I to my friend, if my love r now makes me rafh:, I muft attempt it,., be the confeqiience what it will*, andas? to leaving Paris, it is what I propofe do- • ing. We then agreed with the fervant that we would defer our> enterprize only,* until the next day : and to fecure the fuc-cefs of it as much as poflible, he defired us to carry a fuittof men’s deaths for Ma-non to put on, which he thought would . very much facilitate his plan. It was difficult to get them into the houfe j but my , invention fupplied me with the means. I defired De Tiroux to put a thin waiftcoat under his own;- the care of providing every thing'elfe I took upon myfelf: and the next morning when we returned to the hofpital,d carried, concealed in my cloaths, linen and (lockings, and put over my ufual coat a very long • furtout, which
prevented
k
t
K
4
prevented any obfervation on the fulnefs' ■Qf the-reft, of my drefs.
As foon as we got into her room, De Tiroux gave her his waiftcoat, and I my. coat,, as the fur tout was enough to go oul withv and nothing was now wanting ta compleat her drefs, but breeches,, which by a flrange overfight. I had forgotten*. The diftrefs this omiffion threw us into was ridiculous enough, and in any other fituation would have been laughable; but in the hazardous ftate of our enter--prize, it was too feriqus an'embarraffment. I Vv'as half diftradled that fo trifling a. cirr cumftance ftiould threaten to overturn our whole fcheme j however I had no means of remedying the evil , but by giving her my own, which I did without farther hefitatioH \ and in my long furtout, and with fome contrivance, I got out myfelf without any remark being made on this
deficiency
/
deficiency of my apparel, and returned to De Tiroux’s houfe, where the day appeared the longed: I had ever pafled.
Nio;ht at length came: we got into x
O	O	Of
fiacre, and went at the appointed time to the ftreet into which the great door of Xhe hofpital opens, and waited a few yards below it j where we had not been many minutes, before Manon and her condudlor appeared. They both got in: I received Manon in my arms, who trembled like a leaf. The coachman afl<:ed where he was to go ? Drive me, faid I, to the end of the world—carry me where I fhall never more be feparated from Manon!
This unguarded fally, which I know not what poflelTed me to make, nearly occafioned the moft fatal confequence.
The coachman remarked fo extraordinary
an.
«•
t
an expreflionj and when De Tiroux told him whither he fliould drive us, he faid he was afraid we were engaged in a bad' affair, and perhaps he fhould be involved in its confequences j. for he faw plainly that the handfome youth was a woman whom we had refcued from the hofpitalj, and he was not all difpofed to ruin himr felf to oblige us. This fcrupulous nicety meant only that we were to pay an ex* traordinary price for the coach; but we were in too much danger for expoftula^-tion, Hufh! hufh! friend, cried I, it: will be a Louis d’or in your way : after, which, if I had propofed to him to burn: the hofpital he would have affifted me witfiGiit fcruple.

We were now taken to L’Efcaut’s lodg* . ino:s. It was late, and, De Tiroux defired to. be put down near his own houfe, which ^as in oijr way, promifing to call upon

US the next day. Manon wept with joy at feeing herfelf as we hoped in fecurity:

but we had dreadful alarms yet to encounter. When we flopped at the door of the houfe where L’Efcaut lodged, a difpute commenced with the coachman that threatened the moft fatal cataftrophe : I repented of having promifed him a Louis; not only becaufe the fum was fo unreafonable, but becaufe I really had not a Louis in the world: a Louis however I Ihould have given him if I could have obtained it from L/Efcaut, whom I fent for to the door, and told him in a whifper my fituation.
He, who was of a fierce and violent difpo-
fition, and but little accuftomed to moderate his ill humour towards the driver of a ■ fiacre, anfwered aloud—a Louis fpr the
w
rafcal! give him rather twenty good blows with your cane! So faying, he fnatched my cane out of my hand, meaning to execute his threat 5 but the coachman, who
»
had.
w*
\
had perhaps before felt, that the wrath of a life guard, or mourqueteer, was not to be encountered with impunity, drove off as fall as he could, loudly complaining that I had deceived him, but that he knew how to make me repent it, and that I Ihould certainly hear from him. This gave me the feverelt inquietude; for I doubted not but that he would apply to the nextCommilTary, and tell all he knew of us^ You undo us, L’Efcaut, faid T, there is now no fafety for us here *, we rnultinftantly depart,, or the Commilfary wilLbe upon us>. So faying, I gave Manon my arm, and haftened away from a place where we were, in fuch inftant danger, accompanied by. L’Efcaut, and followed by the I'ervant.
It is aftonilhing by what a Erange courfe Providence fometimes brings about ks ordinations. Scarce had we advanced an hundred paces on our way,, when a man of military , appearance, but whofe face I
did,
\
L 213 j
did not diftindly fee, approached us, and •going clofe to L’Efcaiu, cried out “ It is, L’Efcaut; lie flips to-night in the other world,” and inilantly hred a piftol, the ball of which entered his temple, and he fell dead at our feet, while the aflaffin efcaped immediately.
I now preflfed Manon more eagerly to liaften away. To the corps before us^’ our prefence was ufelefs, and our afiiftancc impoflible; and I dreaded that the watch, who I knew would inilantly appear, would •flop us. We hallened then, Manon, the fervant and I, down the firll crofs Ilreet that we came to; but die was fo terrified that it Was with great difficulty I fupported her trembling Heps kill we reached the end of the Ilreet, where we faw a fiacre
hand, into which we got; but when the
$ •
coachman alked us where he fhould take tis to, I knew not what to reply,
I had
1 had r*o certain afylum, no friend to whom I dared have recourfe in this exi-^ gency j and what was yet worfe, I was without money, having not more than half a Louis in my pod^et. Fright and fatigue had fo overwhelmed Manon, that j(he was fainting in my arms, while my own imagination was filled with horror and amazement at the recent ‘murder of L’Efcaut, and dread of being flopped by the watch; What could I do ? whither go ? -Happily, after a moment’s paufe, I Tccolle^led the inn at Chaillot, where I paifed fome days with Manon before I went to live in the village, I thought 'that there, as I was known, I Ihould obtain credit for fome days, and be in fafety. Carry us to Chaillot, faid I to the coachman: he refufed to go thither fo late under a piftole, which was another fub* je6l of embarrafiment. At length, however, we agreed for fix livres, which was nearly all the money I had 5 and we went
on,
X
1 215 J
Dn, while I endeavoured to confole Manon; though in fa6l defpair was in my heart.
I believe I fliould have been tempted to put an end to my exiftence, had I not held in my arms her who alone made life defirable. That confoling refledtion gave me courage to meet the diftreffes before me. I have her, faid I, once more ! flie is mine ! Ibe loves me! what is the world to me, what calamity can I not encounter with indifference, while fure of that affedtion which is more to me than the univerfe! I felt however, that while the world was thus (lightly regarded, 1 wanted fome of its comforts to fave me from the deplorable indigence which threatened me.
It was near midnight when we arrived at Chaillot: but the people of the inn re«» ceived us like their old cuftomersj nor
were

were they furprifed at feeing Manon en cavalier^ fince it is not unufual in France for women to aflume different appearances.

I direded as elegant a fupper to be immediately prepared for her, as if we had been in the higheft affluence : fhe did not know that I was without money, and I determined to conceal it from her, and return in the morning to Paris, where I hoped to find a remedy for that worfl of
' t

While we flipped, my eyes wandered over her perfon, which the darknefs of the room in which fhe was at the hofpital, and the confufion we had been in fince fhe left it, had prevented my obferving be- ^ fore.

fat down upon the grafs, that 1 might reflect for a moment on what I had to do at Paris.
I had three points to confider, which required all my attention. I wanted every thing requifite for our prefent fnpport, and fome means of procuring fubfiftence hereafter *, and what was not of Ids im-portance, I had meafures to take to fecLire the fafety of Manon and my-feif.
After having exhaufted every idea on the two laft fubjedls, I could conclude on nothing; but was obliged to confine my-felf to the moft prdTing circumftance, which was that of getting a fupply of money. I thought, as to the reft, that for fome days we might remain at Chaillot without any hazard j and that it would be time enough to provide for
L 2	our
/
*our future expences when we had pre-'Cured wherewithal to pay for onr immC’. diate fupport.
The queftion then was reduced to this; how to procure a fum for my •prefentufe? De Tiroux had repeatedly
4
offered me his afliftancc; but how could I determine to accept it *, how fubmit to lay open to a man who was almoft a llranger to ‘me, my mifery and my poverty, ..and afk him for money. could not think'of it without the utmoft pain and confufion.
I then turned my thoughts towards my friend Tiberge. My firft friend! my good Tiberge! cried I-, be will not fnrely refufe me ? I know the goodnefs of his nature; he will be touched with my forrows, and will relieve them. But .^alasl he will harrafs me with precepts to
which
*
L	J
which r cannot liften, and I (hall ’be' forced to hear exhortations and reproaches' which will embitter ail his kindnefs : and ' there is hardly any thing I would not' rather endure than go thio’ the irkfome fcene -to which my application to him will sxpofe me, and the trouble and remorfe it will make me fufFtr. But is it of my-felf I am to think ? No! it is the fupport Manon! her very exigence, that-is now in qneftion. Her love and fidelity depend on my finding means to -fupply her with convenienciesj - and com- ’ pared to the fear of lofing her every, other confideration is as nothing j for (he is to me in place of glory, hap.pinels, ? and fortune! After this argument myv foliloquy was foon at an end: I arofe, and continued my way towards the-, refi*-dence of Tiberge.

On entering Paris I took a hackney , coach, though I had not enough to pay

for the hire of it; yet I thought myfelf fo fare of procuring money from Tiherge, that I felt no uneahnefs about that. I i

Though I never entertained any doubts of his obliging me, I was fur-prifed that I heard no murmurs or reproaches.' But I was deceived in thinking

I had not mentioned Manon'; and he

He told me that he-happened to go to St. Lazare the day after my efcape, where he was fliocked-and furprifed at hearing the manner of it' from the good Superior,, who had not recovered from his fear and agitation,.

I heard him to the endj and in much of his difeourfe I found fubjedt of fatis-fadion. 1 had nothing now to dread from the affair of St. Lazare, and tnight walk fearlefsly in the ftreets of Paris. I was alfo glad to find that Tiberge had not the fmalleft idea that Manon was out of the hofpital, and again with me; and remarked that he avoided naming her, in the pcrfuafion perhaps that my attach-

My hope was, that fuch an .application
would induce him to fend me a. fnm of money under pretence of having occafion for it to defray the expences of a. courfe of exercifes in the academy j (for I did not believe he would again liften to my pretenfions of entering into orders) nor,, in profeding a defire to begin a courfe of academical exercife was I entirely infmeere.
I. wifhed to be occupied by fuch improvements as became my age, and the ftation to which I was born, when thefe pur-fuits could be conciliated with my love-; .

I promifed Tiberge to write that verf day to my father; and as foon as I left him went into a coffee houfe for that piirpofe. I wrote in a ftyle fo moving and fubmilTive, that in reading over my letter I perfuaded myfelf it would have the effed I intended, on the tender and paternal heart of my father.,
Tho’ I was now in a fituation to pay a
ft
coach, I felt myfelf fo proud of my liberty, that I refolved to go on foot to De Tironx’s; but as 1 walked along, it ftruck me that though I had nothing to-

much, that going into an obfcnre corner^ I called from thence to the firil hackney coach I faw paflTing, which carried me diredtly to De Tiroux, who laughed heartily at my fright when I deferibed it to him. It appeared indeed laughable to myfelf, when he informed me I had nothing to apprehend either from aflifting in the flight of Manon or from having been prefent at the death of her brother. He faid, that fearing he might himfelf have been fufpe^ted of carrying off Manon from the hofpital, he had gone thither the next day, and pretending entire ignorance of what had happened, afked to fee her; and that the people of the houfe were fo far from fnppofing that either himfelf or me had had any fhare in her elopement, that they eagerly related her flight to him, and expreffed their aflonifliment that fo beautiful a girl as Manon fhould go off with a ferv^ant. To which De
Tiroux

Tiroux anfvvered coldly, that he faw, nothing furprizing in it; for liberty was-fo defirable, that it was., natural to lofe; fight of all other confiderations in our endeavours to obtain it.
De Tiroux, from the hofpital went ta. L’Efcaut’s lodgings, not doubting but that Manon and I were there •, but the. man of the houfe . protefted he had not. feen us, and told him it was not at all furprizing that we had not been there,. for that we undoubtedly had heard L’Efcaut was alfaffinated. On enquiring of this man into the circumftances of this extraordinary affair,, he.,.had learned, that about two hours before it happened, one. of L’Efcaut’s comrades in the guards > came to his room, and they fat down to play; when L’Efcaut won fo rapidly, that the other, who in lefs than an hour had loft all his money, (confifting of .
about
4
'•about an hundred crowns,) from iffipa-* tience became outrageous and wheli they left play finding himfelf without a livre, had defired L’Efcaut to lend him fome of the money he had won of him ; which not being readily complied with, ^ quarrel began, which arofe to the higheft pitch of animofity on both fides, and a challenge was given which L’Efcaut re-“fufed to accept j whereupon the other left him, fwearing he would take the firft opportunity of being revenged, which threat he executed the fame night.
Monfieur De Tiroux added that he liad been extremely uneafy about Manon and me, and anxious to know where we were. I informed him of the place of our retreat; and he begged I would give him leave to fup with us that evening, which requeft I anfwered as hrs 'friendly politenefs de-ferved.

I know not whether he thought I made this propofal to take advantage, of his generolity, or whether he a6led from the mere impulfe of his natural liberality, but he agreed to go with me to the fliops, and begged he might recommend thofe that ferved his father’s houfe; where he hirnfelf chofc many articles of apparel, much richer and of an higher price than 1 fhouid have thought of purchafing, and forbid the tradefmen to receive any money from me in payment, which he took entirely on hiiTifclf. This he did in a manner fo roole and eafy, that I did not biulh at receiving his generous gifts;
and
and as foon as onr commifTions were executed we haftened to Chaillot, wh^re I rejoined Manon, with a heart mndh, lightened of the weight it feit when I left her in the morning.
The attention I had given to the Chevalier des Grieux convinced him I was much intereded in his hiftory *, but as he had now fpoken for near two hours, and appeared fatigued, I begged he would take a Ihort refpite, and favor us with his company at fupper.

My return with an air of perfc^
content, and the polite atten* tions of my friend de Tironx, diffipated all remaining anxiety from the bofom of Manon. Her countenance was again lightened up with fmiles, and her eyes
reafllimed their luftre. Let us forget,

More bappy with Manon and my hundred piftoles, than the richeft citizen of Paris with his accumulated treafures, I gave way to the gaiety of my prefent difpofition; nor did any fears for the future, embitter thefe agreeable moments, I was almoft fure that my father would allow me wherewithal to live handfomely at Paris, becaufe as I was now in my twentieth year I Ihould foon have a right to demand a lhare of my mother’s fortune.
I did not conceal from Manon that my prefent ftock of money confifted only of an hundred piftoles; but it was enough to keep us from inconvenience till fomething better occurred; which me thought muft foon happen, either
from
*
from the claims I had on my motherV property, or from the refources of play. The firft fortnight or three weeks palled without my thinking of any thing but the happinels I was again poflelled of. Some remains of fenti-ment, as well as fome fear of the Police, made me delay from day to day returning to the Aflbciation at the Hotel de Tranfylvanie. I contented myfelf with frequenting lefs remarkable parties; anc the favour of fortune for this time prevented the necellity of my having re-Gourfe to any diflionorable means to fecure her on my fide. I ufually palled a part of my afternoon at Paris, and returned to fupper at Chaillot frequently accompanied by Monfieur de Tiroiur, whofe friendlhip for us feemed hourly to augment.

‘merit in the company of fome young M'omen in the neighbourhood, whom the return of fpring had brought to Chaillot. Walking, and little parties at each other’s houle, alternately employed them; and the trifling winnings they made at their card tables were allotted by the winner to pay for their coach. They frequently went to walk in the Bois de Boulogne; and when I returned of an evening I found Manon more gay, more tender^ and more lovely than ever,
*
Some pafiing clouds however a little obfeured the fun-lhine of my happinefs. But they were foori diflTipated ; and the gay and entertaining humour of Manon even turned them to our amufement, which I ftill remember with a melancholy plcafure, and my lovely unfortunate

the charms I then faw her adorned wity when youth, beauty, and vivacity even jio extravagance, (and which would have become nobody elfe) made her the naoil dangerous and moft enchanting obje^ in the creation.
One evening, on my retiirn from Paris, the only vakt we kept (and who
was the fame as had delivered Marion from the hofpital) took me on one fide, and told me, in an embarraOed manner, that he had a fecret of importance to communicate to me. I encouraged him to fpeak; and he faid, after fome hefita-tion, that a foreign nobleman feemed to^ have conceived a pafTion for Manon,* I'he agitation of fpirits into which this intelligence threw me, occafioned an immediate change in my countenance. Has flie fhewn any inclination for him? faid I,, in. a voice fufficiently exprelTive

of what I felt. Not that I know of. Sir, anfwered my fervant, who was frightened at the vehemence of my manner, but having feen this foreigner conftantly frequent the Bois de Boulogne
at thofe hours when he was fure of meet-
♦
ing Mademoifelle Manon, and , often endeavour to engage her in converfation,
I thought it would be right to find out who he was, and therefore made acquaintance with his fervants; from whom 1 have learned that he is an Italian Prince, and that he frequents thefe walks with a view to fome adventure of gallantry; but I could gain no farther intelligence. This nobleman having difcovered that I belonged to Mademoifelle, told me, as he pafled by me to go to his coach, that J was happy to be in the fervice of
I
the moft charming perfon in the world. My fervant trembled while he made this
recital, the end of which I attended to
with
V
[ 7 ‘J
with impatience. I prefied him to dif-- ] cover morej but he protefted he had told me every thing he knew, and that it was only the day before he had learned even that. I afllired him I was pleafed with his fidelity, and even promifed him an handfome reward ^ and without exprefiing any miftruft of Manon, ordered him to- watch the foreigner, and to; relate to me all he obferv'ed.
The manner in which the man re— counted this to me, threw me into the cruelleft alarm and I doubted whether he had not fiippreffed part of what he: knew ; but on confideration I regretted that I had fhewn fo much emotion, for' after all it was poflible that Manon might be ignorant of her conqueft ; nor could I juftly impute it to her as a crime, that lire was beloved. The milery of living ij3.a fate of continual jealoufy was in-

fiipportable; and yet, from what already happened, I felt that all my fufpicions returned on the flighteft idea of a rival,
I went the next day to Paris as ufual, without having formed any other refoiu-tion than that of playing as deep and def-perately as I could, in hopes that if fortune favoured me I might be in a fitu-ation to quit Chaillot the moment I found any farther fubjed of inquietude. On my return, my man informed me that the foreign, nobleman had appeared as ufual in the walks, and had fpoken again to him, (the valet) and entered into a warm detail of his love for Made.-moifelle Manon j relative to whom he alked a multitude of queftions, and endeavoured to win him by a confiderable bribe to deliver a letter (which he pro-; duced) to his miftrefs.

Three days afterwards all my appre-
henfjons feemed to be confirmed: Re-
turning

t\arnlng from Paris rather later than ufual,, L was told that Manon, being that evening in the v/alks with her compat nions, had left them for a moment, and had gone into one of theoppofite walks-, whither the foreigner had followed her, and had received a letter which fhe gave him with the moft- extravagant expref--fions of jpy, which Manon however did not flay, to fee, but inftantly rejoined her company, leaving her, lover to kifs and half devour the letter, with the grimaces peculiar to his country. During the reft of her walk, as well as fince fhe came home, the vivacfty of her humour had exceeded its ufual bounds ; and fhc -had inceftantly worn the appearance of the moft thoughtlefs gaiety. Every word' of this account turned my blood cold^ and I made tlie fellow repeat; what he had told me, again and again*, but finding no variation in his ftory, I could not

doubt of my approaching misfortune and I know not what I fhould have done, if Manon, who heard .my voice, had. not come down flairs to^ meet me,, and' tenderly reproached, me with my long^ abfence,.
As loon as we were alone, Ihe over?^ whelmed me with carefles, and com*-plained in the warmefl,. yet tendereft terms, , of my long and frequent abfence j , and (as I flill continued filent) Ihe told, me that for above three weeks I had never palled; twelve hours at homethat being fo much without me was infup-portable, and Ihe expeded h would, fometimes pafs a whole day with her and particularly the next day that, nothing Ihould induce me to quit her,, but that I Ihould promife to flay with her both the morning and afternoon.

not that I will, anfwered I, ^arply, and

with ajook that might have ferved to-* alarm her; but fhe took no notice of my warmth, and began to converfe - with < more than her ufual i fprightlihefs and, gaiety,^ giving me the lovelieft pi6ture: of;the,chara6ters of her companions, and the manner; in which, they paffed their timer. What am I to expert from all this, faid Iito myfelf? Strange girl I '^hoW' unaccountable is thy condu6t! ■ Such an

The concern thefe ideas, gave me,.. threw an air of melancholy into my be-haviour which , I imputed • to. a lofs at pky. i confidered, that r the, next: day,, as ihe had hcrfelf engaged me not, to »
quit:
%
quit her, I Ihould have time for deli--beration, and to make farther remarks 5

and 1 determined that if nothing, appeared; to oblige me openly to avow, my fufpicions, I would quietly remove to.-Paris the next day, and take care to fix in fome obfcLire part, of the town, where I lhould have nothing to apprehend frorn a competition with Italian Princes. This determination, without putting me en-r tirely at.eafe, made me rather more tran-» quil the reft of the evening.,
%
When we arpfe in the morning, Manon told me that tho’fhe defired to pafs the whole day alone in our apartment, fhe would notwithftanding have me drefs, and that fhe herfelf would drefs.my hair.. My hair, was then remarkably fine, and fhe had frequently amufed herfelf. in dift pofing it in different fafhions: I now
therefore fat down before her toilet, as
ufual,
t
. ' %
y
«
ufual, that flie might gratify this whim.’ She continued playing a thoufand tricks with my hair, and once or twice made me turn my face towards her^s, and looked at me with an air of curiofity and fatis-fadion. In this trifling way we had paf-fed part of the morningand after dinner Ihe continued in the fame playful mood, while her innocent chearfulnefs feemed fo natural, and fo unlike artifice, that I could not believe it a prelude to a new inftance of treafon: and I was once or twice on the point of opening my fufpicions to her, but delayed it only in hopes of her confelling to me. what had pafled.
While Ihe was ftill trifling thus agreeably, and had infifted again on re-adjulling my head, the fervant came in to fay that the Prince of Villabianca was below, and defired to fee Mademoifelle. This threw me into a tranfport of rage. Who ? ^	~	' What

What Prince?’ What does it mean* cried I; pnlhing her from me ? Let him ; come up, faid Ihe calmly to the, fervant, who. thereupon left the, room. Then, Manon, turning to me, faid in the, mofl: enchanting voice, beloved oLmy heart thou whom I adore ! I afk only one mo--ment’s.cpmplaifance j ovAy one mo-, ment ! I'iiall love thee a thoufand times better.than ever y and fliall be obliged to > you as dong as I live for indulging me. I;fought for words to exprefe my indig-.

nation and furprife,, while. Ihe repeated i her;entreaties; then, hearing the door of-the.ant-ichamber open, the took, in onc; hand my long hair, which was floating on my Ihoulders, and in the other the,^^
i
orlafs' which flood - on her toilet, and; going thus up to the, door: of her clofet, which, fhe, puflied open, Ihe, offered , to , the eyes of the afloniflied flranger, a fpec- .
tacle, of which he could not comprehend:
the

[ *5 ]■
the meaning. Notwithftanding his emr. barraiTment, he failed not to make a-moft profound bow.. But Manori did not: give him time to fpeaki lhe. held her glafs to his face : Sir, faid Ihe, look well at yourfelf and do me juftice.:.you defire-my love: behold the man to whom I; have given it, and to whom I have fwom-> eternal fidelity : compare him with yourfelf, and fee whether you have any, pre-. tenfions to difputc my heart j if you have,, tell me on what thefe pretenfions are.; founded: tho’ I declare to you,.that,in, the eyes of your very humble, fervant all. the Princes of Italy are of lefs eftimation i than one of thefe beautiful trelTes.
During this ridiculous harangue,% which Ihe had undoubtedly meditated,
I made fruitlefs efforts to difensase

myfelfi and feeling fome compaffion for a man of rank treated with fo little
ceremony,

C I6 J
ceremony, I was even difpofed to apo^ logize for this infult. But he prefendy recovered his furpriCe j and his anfwer, which I thought grofs, took from me all my, intentions, of confoling. .him* Mademoifelle, faid he, with a forced fmile,.^ my eyes are. indeed opened; and I., fee you are not the novice I took you for. He went down flairs without looking behind him,., and .muttering that the women of France, were, no better than, thofe of Italy; and I was not tempted to give him a^ better opinion of the fair fex,,
I*
s
Manon^, as foon as he was gone, threw herfelf into a chair, and made the room echo with burfls of laughter, in. which I could not forbear accompanying
her, tho* I own, I thought fhe had car^
ried the pleafantry too far. Touched as
J was with a facrifice, which I could
attribute
[‘7 3
attribute only to love, I felt that flie was become more dear to me than ever; 1 laughingly reproached her, however, with her rigour to her Italian lover. She recounted to me the progrefs of the amour-, and told me that after having continually tormented her in the Bois de Boulogne, where he exprefled his love by the moft ridiculous grimaces, he had written her a letter by the coachman, wherein he made her a formal declaration of love, and gave her his name and all his titles, and promifed her, on the other (ide the Alps, a brilliant fortune and eternal adoration. That llie had at firft determined to communicate this adventure to me ; but that fancying fhe could produce fome amnfement from it, fhe could not refill making the experiment, and had fent the Italian a flattering anfwer, with liberty to fee her at her houfej and that fhe enjoyed the fur-
prize

[ 1 s 1
prize in which flie {hould throw us both by her manner of refufing him. I faid not a word of the knowledge ! had: gained of this affair by another means i and the intoxication of love made me
approve of all fhe had done..
i have remarked throughout, that when I thought myfelf the happieft. Heaven has chofen that hour for my Ghaftifement. Thus it was at this period, when I felt myfelf fo well af-fured of Manon’s tendernefs, and the friendfhip of De Tiroux, that I appre--hended nothing from the malignity of my deftiny. That deftiny however ftill purfued me, and. now- prepared for me fuch a fatal cataftrophe, as reduced me to the deplorable extremity in which you faw, me at Ptfly, and, afterwards into
fuch calamities a? can hardly be be« lieved,
I
[	19 ]
One evening, a few days after Manon had difmilTed her Italian admirer, we were at fupper at our hotel with De Tiroux, when we heard a coach flop at the door, a circumftance which at that unufual hour excited our curiofity. We enquired who it was, and heard that it was young Gevres de Malleville, the fon of our moll cruel enemy; at whofe name name the blood rufhed into my face. He comes, cried I impetuouQy, that I may punifh him for the infamous nfage I have received from his father: he fliall not leave the place till we have meafuredourfwords. Monfieur de Tiroux, ■whofe intimate friend he was, entreated me to be cool, and affured me he was a moft amiable young man, whofe fen-timents were fo different from thofe of his father, that nothing had ever given him fo much concern as the injuries we had fuffered; and that I fhould no fooner be acquainted with him than I fhpuld grant
him
’ /
[	20 J	I
t
!;
him my friendfliip, and be defirous of his.
4
He entreated me to give hi in leave' to bring him tip, and‘ invite him to partake of our fupper v and protefted that Manon was in no danget^ from this interview, as he could anfwer for De Malleville as for himfelf j and was fure that as foon as he knew us he would become our moft zealous advocate. After-
V
fuch aJTurances I no longer hefitated^, and De Tiroux went down to his friend.
Before they joined us, he told him tO> whom he was going to be introduced, and we beheld a young man whofe perfea, and . addrels were very pleafing.and^agreG-. able. He expreffed in polite terms his fatisfadtion at the favour Tiroux had done him jn procuririg him our acquainti-
- I . ^ -i
"* ■ .
ance>3 anil eat of our repaft with an appe-^
tite that did it honor. When the fer-
%
wants had removed the table, our con-verfation became more ferious .* he aflumed an air of contrition and forrow, in (peaking of the outrage his father had committed, and made us many apolo*,,. gies. 1 will fhorten my excufes, faid he, to leave as foon as poffible a fubjedt which I cannot recolledt without fhame. Warm as thefe fentiments' were in the beginning of our converfation, they foon became much more fo.; for he had not been half an hour with us, before I dif-covered that the charms of Manon had their ufual effedl •, his eyes and manner fenfibly betrayed him ; and tho’ he carefully avoided every word that tended that way, I had too much experience in love not to know the fource of his looks and attentions. He ftaid with us till a very late hour, and it was day
break
1
L J
break before he could determine to quif us, which at length he did with a thoufand proteftations of unalterable friendfhip, and with a requeft that we would give him leave fometimes to renew
a vifit which had given him fo much pleafure.
A	t
He took De Tiroux with him in his coach. I had at this time the moft tranquil reliance on the conftancy of
Manon, and the obfervations I made
/
gave me no manner of uneafinefs. That lovely creature was fo entirely miftrels of my heart, that I had no other fen-timents than thofe of adoration joined to efteem; and far from imputing to her as a crime that flie had charmed De Malleville, I felt my felf-love flattered in finding myfelf the foie poffelTor of the heart and perfon of a woman whom all the world feemed to allow the moft en-
chanting
/
\
clianting and perfed: of her fex; and I determined not to mention to her what I had remarked of De Mallevillc.
As we were now provided with deaths Jit to appear in public, and thought
there was not any hazard in it, Manon
*
was defiroLis of going to the play : De Tiroux, however^ who came early the next day, was to be confulted upon this j
I
and he foon found that to gratify Manon he muft fay yes. But this refolution was not executed : for having taken me apart, he told me he was extremely un-cafy at fomething that had happened: I came hither to tell yon, faid he, the confequence of our party lad night; Gevres de Malleville is madly in love with Manon, and has told me fo : however I am attached to him, I am equally fo to you. His intentions in regard to her are extremely blameable and unjud,
and
%
L 24 J
&nd I do not confider myfelf obliged to keep his fccret, which perhaps I might have done had he meant only to have tried his fortune fairly with your miftrefs. But I find that he is well informed of the difpofition of Mademoifelle Manon. He knows file loves pleafure and affluence, and as he is already pofiTefiTed of a confi-derable fortune, he means to tempt her at once by a magnificent prefent, and the offer of a fettlement of ten thoufand
livres a year. Had you been upon an
>
, equal footing, I Ihould perhaps have made a point of not betraying him; but jtiftice, as well as friendfiiip, obliges me to put you on your guard, and the more fb as I have been the unlucky caufe of his paffion, by imprudently introducing him to your acquaintance,
I thanked De Tiroux for this important communication 5 and with an inge-
nuoufnefs
/
i ^5 J
ncipiifnefs equal to his own, I acknoW'^' ledged that De Mallevilie had been rightly informed as to the difpofition of Marion : that poverty was an evil Ihe coul4 not fnpport; but that however while there was only a difference of more or iefs I believed her quite incapable of quitting me for another.

This uncxpefted and iinwilhed fdf event brought the danger fo near^
that I could no longer look on it with
♦
indifference j and as 1 faw that De Malle-ville was determined to open himfelf to Manon^ I thought it better to tell her what I had heard of the intentions of this . new rival; believing that when Ihe found I knew of his addreffes, fhe would have ftrength enough to refufe his offers. I told DeTiroux my thoughts, who
«
anfwered that it was a delicate meafure to hazard. I owned it was, but that every right a man could have to depend upon the fidelity of a woman, I had to rely on that of Manon, She loves eafe
and luxury, but Ihe loves me I trufi:

She thanked me for the good opinion I had of her, and protefted flie ■would receive the offers of Gevres de Malleville in fuch a manner as ffioiild give him no inclination to renew them. No, faid I, you muff: not venture offending him by any rudenefs j he may be very hurtful to ns; but you know ways enough, you little rogue you, to

I fuffered myfelf again to be drawn into this irreparable ruim, by the caprice of an adored miftrefs j.. and while I agreed to make a dupe of De Malleville, by the, ufual fatality that attended me, I became his.
About eleven o’clock his coach Hopped. He made us the moil ftudied compliments on, the liberty he took in coming to dine with us—De Tiroux had invented fome excufe to avoid

I
and took De Tiroux with me on pretence of having fomething to fay to him;' De Malleville therefore had an opportunity of fpeaking to Manon, of which he failed not to take advantage. I found on my return that flie had not given him reafon to defpair, for he was > ' in the gayeft humour in the world. I affedted the fame vivacitv; and he laughed inwardly at my fimplicity; while the whole afternoon pafled away in lively difcourfe or profeffions of regard; and he went away as much pleafed with my apparent eafinefs, as with the elegance of our. entertainment,.

I ran on thus, as the various emotions arofe in my foul, almoft without knowing what I was doing, till the violence of my agitation, which was too great to Jaft, began to fublide. The tranfport of pahion by degrees gave way to other refledions. I confidered that this cala-np.ity was poffibly to be repaired; and I afked myfelf why I fhould be fo extremely afflidted at a circumftanee which I might have eafily forefeen, and indeed ^■s eafily have prevented: and why Ihould

I not rather endeavour to find a remedjr for my misfortunes, than perpetuate them by giving myfelf up to ridiculous and ufelefs defpondency. I then began to refledl: on every means that were likely to reflore my miftrefs to me. To undertake to tear her by force from De Malleville, would be defperation, and had not the lead: appearance of fuccefs : but I thought if I could fee her for a moment, the influence I ftill hoped I had over her would again throw her into my arms. I thought'I knew her heart
and its feelings fo well, that I fhould at-

tack it with advantage. I knew ihe loved me j and amidft her giddinefs, and wanton trifling With my anguifh, I thought I had a lading afcendancy over her. I determined then to employ every art to procure a fight of her j and after VoL. II.	C	many

De Tiroux had rendered me fo many fervices, that I could not doubt of the fmcerity of his friendfhip and afihdion for me: I propofed then to go to him inftantly, and engage him to fend for
Gevres de Malleville, on fome pretence
«
or other, which might give me time to fpeak to Manon; whom I meant to feek even in the houfe of Gevres de Malle-ville, during his abfence. This idea re-fiored me to fome degree of tranquility.
I made a liberal prefent to the young girl who was ftill with me j and that flic might not return to De Malleville to recount the fcene that had pafled, I took from her a diredtion to her lodgings, and gave her reafon to believe I would pafs the night with her there.

As foon as I had difmiffed her^ I got into my fiacre, and bid the coachman drive me as faft as polTible to St. Anne’s ftreet, where De Tiroux dwelt, and I
H
was lucky enough to find him at home, of which good fortune I doubted, and feared as I went along. I acquainted him inftantly with the fubjeft of my un-eafinefs, and the fervice I expected from him. He feemed furprifcd and fhocked to learn that De Malleville had fo eafily, fed need Manon from me j and he knew that he was the original occafion of it, by introducing him fo inconfiderately to our acquaintance; and I took care not to tell him that I had in a great meafure been accefiary to my own misfortune, by confenting to the plan Manon had formed of poflefling herfelf of De Malleviile’s money and prefents, and

De Tiroux, full of indignation againft

Let us keep our fwords, faid I, for the laft
extremity only, I think I have found an eafier and more certain way. ,
He acceded to all I propofed, and

engaged without hefitation to do whatever I requefled of him, I told him then, that all I now wifhed was, that he would fend a meffage to De Malleville, to let

I will watch, faid I, the moment of his coming out, and being known only to Marion and my valet, I fhall eafily gain admittance to her. When De Malleville comes, tell him that the preffing affair on which you defired to* fee him, is a lofs at play, that you muft conceal from your father, and that yott cannot immediately command the money; and defire him to lend it to you for a; few days.

that he eafily could, and we went together foftly up ftairs without meeting any obftacle, and I charged Marcel to fufFer nobody to approach while I was there.
I had now a new occafion to admire the extraordinary charadter of Manon.

After a ftiort paufe: my dear Chevalier ? faid fhe, if you had told me at firft what it was that threw you into this violent agitation, you might have fpared us both infinite pain 5 for I would have afllired you that I was ready to follow you to the end of the world. The letter I wrote to you by the young
woman,
#
[ 62 ]
woman, made you believe, perhaps, that I quitted you for ever, and that I even fent her to fnppljr my place; but indeed this was not my intention, whatever appearance it might have. I will tell you what pafled. It is true that Gevres de Malleville had prepared for me a reception that exceeded every expectation I had formed. The houfe, the furniture,
, the equipage that he has prefented me with, are in the firft ftyle of magnificence. He gave me too a cafket con-
O
taining ten thoufand livres, and a number of jewels, among which are the valuable pearl necklace and bracelets formerly purchafed by his father. An elegant collation was ready for me; after which he propofed that we fhould fit down to piquet while fupper was |

preparing. I will own that all this . profufion ftruck me, I confidered that
it
L ^3 J

it wovild be folly to deprive burfeivcs at once of fo many accommodations, and to content ourfelves only with the money and the jewels; for that fhould 1 continue with De Mallevillc our fortune would evidently be eftablifhed, and we. might live in eafe and affluence at his expence.
I determined therefore to found him in regard to you, that I might fee from his manner what probability there was of our being fuffered to fee each other, if you could be brought to confent to my plan. On my naming you, he afked me what were my fentiments of you, and whether I felt no regret at quitting you ? I an-fwered, that you was every way fo amiable, and had ever treated me with fuch tendernefs, that it would be ftrange if I
had no attachment to you, He allowed
you

you merit j and faid that from the firll he had conceived a favorable opinion of you: but he wifhed to know how I thought you would bear my departurcj when you knew I was with him. I told him that our connexion had now been of fo long continuance, that the firft ardor of your palTion for me was much abated j befides which, that your circumfiances were far from being eafy, and that probably you would on that account be. lefs hurt at an event which relieved you from an cxpence you was ill able to fupport.
«
I added, that I had fo little apprehended any oppofition, tiiat I had ufed y no hneffe to get away, but had told you. I wanted to come to town on fome bufinefs : that you having the fame inten-. tion, we had fet out together, and that 1 left you without your exprefling any

anxiety to know whither I was going. If
I thought, faid he, that the Chevalier
was difpofed to live on terms of amity >
with me, I fhould eagerly offer him my friendfhip and fervices, I aflured him that from what I knew of your chara6ler I had no doubt but that you would receive fuch advances as you ought j particularly if he could aflifi: you in the management of your pecuniary affairs, which in confequence of a long difagree-ment between you and your family, were in the utmoft diforder,
Hejnterrupted me with proteflations of his defire to ferve you to the utmofl of his power in every way: then affuming a gayer air, he faid that if a pretty mif-trefs was your objedt, he would even recommend to you.one he had quitted to attach himfelf to me. I approved of this
idea,

A

idea, continued Manon, more perfectly to deflroy all fufpicion of- my lincerity; and finding every thing likely to favor my.projedl, I anxioufly wifhed for the means of informing you of my change of fyftem, fearing you would be alarmed and irritated at my miffing my appoint-; ment.
*
To obtain means of writing to yon^ then, it was that I propofed to him to fend this new miftrefs to you immediately, I was obliged to have recourfe to this expedient, for I found he would not leave me a moment. Fie Innghed at my fb eafily agreeing to the projedl and calling his valet de chambre, bid him go to the young woman, whofe refidence he knew, and diredt her to go to Chaillot with a inefTage to you, which he was about to deliver, when I flopped him by telling
him

'V
him you was not to be found at Chaillot i for that when I left you 1 had faid I would rejoin you at the play *, or if any unforefeen circiimftance prevented my getting thither, that you had agreed to wait ior me in a fiacre at the end of the rue St, Ajidre. Therefore it would be far better to fend the young woman thither, if it were only to prevent your having the mortification of waiting there fruitlefsly great part of the night; and I added that it would not be amifs to write you a line or two defiring you not to ex-ped me.
To all this he agreed : but I was obliged to write while he looked over me, therefore I dared not explain myfelf too far in the letter, which I now find has given you fo much difquietude. I will conceal nothing from you, my Chevalier,

I liftened to this difconrfe with all the temper I could command j tho* every word was as a dagger to my heart, and overwhelmed me with mortification. Her intended infidelity was fo apparent, that file had not even endeavoured to dif-;guife it. It was her defign to become confeffedly the miftrefs of Gevres de Malleville. What a cruel acknowledgment for me ! and how full of bitter-nefs: yet I refle(5fed that I was in fome degree culpable myfelf j for it was i who had unguardedly thrown the temptation in her way by telling her of Malieville’s paffion for her, and by the blind facility with which I had fuffered myfelf to be drawn into the wild projed of appropriating

The ingenuous confeflion Ihe made affedted me. The fimplicity and open-nefs with which fhe acknowledged her errors, and the motives of thofe errors, had fomething in it irrefiftibly intereft-ing: I fhould perhaps rather fay, that my violent and incurable attachment was alone a ftronger pleader with me than all thefe confiderations, I felt myfelf too much elated with the idea of carrying her away from my prolperous rival to refled longer on her intended perfidy: but I could not help faying, in a melancholy tone of voice. Well, but Manon, with whom did you intend to have palTed this night ? This queftion threw her into an embarralTment that I could not fee without pity; changing

therefore the fubjeft without ihhfting on her anfwer, I told her plainly that I expe(5led flie would inftanrly follow me. I will certainly, Chevalier, faid fhe, if you are abfolutely determined againft my projedt? Your projedt, replied I, is infamous! mention it no more. It is enough that I forgive all that has yet palTed. What then fhall I go without the ten thoufand livres, and the calket of jewels which are mine;
. which he has adtually given me ? Honor is out of the queftion. Has De Malleville adled fo honourably with you^ as to give rife to all thefe fcruples, exclaimed Manon? This argument, a refledtionon our neceflities, and her repeated inftances, got the better once more of the little remains of integrity which my miferable infatuation had left me.

and concluding it to be Gevres de Malle-ville, I told Manon that if he appeared • to contend with me he was a dead man:
nor could I have commanded myfelf at

the fight of him. From this apprehen-fion we were relieved by the entrance of Marcel, who brought me a letter; it was from De Tiroux, to inform me that De Malleville was gone to his own houfe to fetch the money that he (De Tiroux) liad afked of him, and that he had taken advantage of the moment to inform me. He thought I could not take a more plea-fant vengeance on my rival, than by contriving to have him detained for the night, and takingpofleflion of his houfe; which appeared to be eafy enough, if I could engage two or three fteady men, on whom I could depend, to ftop him

in the ftreet, and keep him in cuftody till the morrow. He concluded by pro-

1 fliewed Manon the letter, and told her by what means I had through De Tiroux’s afTiftance got De Malleville out of the way. She was charmed with, the idea, and ftill more with what De Tiroux now propofed: this laft, how-ever, I told her was an adventure I had no inclination to hazard j but fhe abfo-lately inlifted. on my undertaking It was in vain that I reprefented to her ' the improbability of my being able to find people immediately who would undertake to flop De Malleville, and to guard him the whole night: but flie pro-tefted fhe fbould think it 'a want both of courage and of love, if I did not at leaft VoL-II.

Piqued at this infi-nuation, and overcome by her entreaties, I yielded once more to a£t contrary to common fenfe, and againft the prefenti-ment I felt that fome fatal cataftrophe •would be the confequence of indulging this abfurd and phantaftic humour. Nothing feemed fo delightful to her as this projedt. You fhall have his place at fup-per, my Chevalier, faid ihe; you fliall Deep in his bed, and early to-morrow you fhall carry off his money and his miftreis. What a delicious vengeance on both the father and the fon.
Without being tempted with this view of a compleat revenge, and wholly be-caufe fhe would have it fo, I went out in fearch of two or three fubalterns of the guards, to whom L’Efcaut had formerly introduced me. I found only

houfe of De Tiroux to that he had hired for Manon. I defired they would ufe him with civility, but leave no means negledled that might fecure him; which my principal agent protefted he would execute faithfully. His intention, he told me, was to take him to his own lodgings, and there to oblige him (De Malleville) to undrefs, and go into his

This method of fecuring oiif prey feemed well imagined. I retired to an obfcure corner of the llreet, behind my troop •, and foon afterwards I faw De Malleville appear. On my giving the lignal we had agreed upon, that that was the man, the fubaltern advanced to him with a fierce and refolute air, and feizing his fword arm, he put his piftol to his breaft, and told him he had no defign either on his money or his life, but that he muft follow him inftantly, v/ithout noife or refiflancei for if he made the fmalleft effort to efcape, or raife the notice of the ^paffengers, he would inftantly fhoot him.

and feeing the foldiers ready to fudain ■ their officer, made no attempt to difen-page himfeif; and I had the fatisfadion of feeing him led away as quiet as a lamb. Returning inflantly to Manon, I told the fervants, as I went into the houfe, ■ that I had been with Monfieur de Malle- ^ ville, who was unexpedtedly engaged by an affair that would not permit him to re-

That I may explain at once the caufe of this terrible effe<51:, I fliould remind you, that when De Malleville left the houfe of Manon, he had ordered one of his fervants to follow him. This man was only a few paces behind his mafter when the foldiers had feized him *, arrd

Not however finding him at home, and not knowing any other means of obtaining help, he went from thence to old De Malleville, where, breathlefs with his fear, he communicated to the father what had befallen his fon, in its moft: alarming colours. The old man (who had no other child, and who knew that h-is fon’s thoughtlefs follies continually expofed him to danger,) was terrified at this account: he forced, by the fevereft: threats, the trembling valet to give him an exa(5t account of what his fon had done, and with whom he had pafted that day ; that he might know if he had been in fuch company as made it probable he might be engaged in a quarrel either at play or of gallantry.

This recital made old De Malleville conclude that a love affair was the caufe of his fon’s alarming adventure j and late as it was he determined to go inflantly
to the Lieutenant of the Police: he

We had gone into the chamber, the door of which, as well as tv/o others between that and the ftair cafe, was fliut, which prevented our hearing the

Amidft the confnfion of this fcene,

I anfwered not; but remained ftupid and irrefolute, while old De Malleville feemed to ftand meditating how to proceed : then, as if fome particular recolle<flion had lighted up the fmothered rage in his bofom, he ad-dreffed himfelf to me ; Wretch! you have deftroyed my fon 1 I am fure of it!

Then ftepping to the door, he called five or fix of the foldiers who were waiting below, and ordered them in* Handy to fecure all the perfons in the houfe, Manon, who fat all this while weeping on the bed, now attradfed his attention : he approached her, and ironically felicitated her on the power of her charms, which had fuch influence over the father and the fon *, he would even have proceeded to further impertinence, had I not faid fiercely to him, dare not touch her, execrable monfter! if thou doH, be affured that .nothing but my

I know not what were his firfl: inten'

^	O
were when he left us, the intelligence he gained below Hairs, put an end to all the lenity he might at the beginning have propofed. On enquiry of the fer-vants who were fecured, he found he could learn nothing from thofe who had been lately hired for Manon by his fon; but finding that Marcel had lived with

What had happened to young De Malle-ville he knew notj but he knew ail the former part of our fcheme, and had been inftru6led in the (hare he was to have in it; and he told De Malleville that we cither had or meant to cheat his fon, and that Mademoifelle had already received ten thoufand livres, which according to our fcheme would never be reftored to the heirs of the houfe of De Malleville.
After having received this account, the old man returned to us, tremblinp-

It needed but little refedion to convince me that to be fent to the Chatelet would be the moft dreadful thing that could happen to us.

I would have told her my apprehenfions *, but as there was no remedy, I knew not how to aggravate the terrors which fhe already felt: I could only figh, and embrace her: and of all the emotions with which I was agitated, I dared exprefs only my love. Manon, faid I, tell me truly, will you fwear ever to love me, and me only ? She anfwcred, that her

We now arrived at the prifon;, and were carried into feparate apartments^ as indeed I had forefeen.

I embraced Manon be* fore we were torn afunder; and having

My father, who knew more of the world than Tiberge, judged rightly enough that there was fornething at the

Charmed to find my judge fo favorably difpofed, I explained the laft adventure in a manner fo much to my advantage, and fpoke with fo much moderation and refpedl, that he feemed very well fatisfied with my account of the matter, and with my

At the mention of her a thoufand tender recollections rulhed upon me*, and while I cxprefled

A fon who is more an objedl of pity than anger. Some tears fell from my eyes— my heart was full—I could fay no more. i
The heart of a father; of a worthy, a good father, is an affemblage of all the tendered: fentiments of nature. That of mine, (who befides being the mod affectionate of parents, was alfo a man of fenfe, and had a cultivated mind) was fo affected with the manner of my anfwer, that he could no longer conceal his emotion.

After all,, there was nothing fo very' dark in my ftory that I need fear, to relate-it. Compared with the condudl of many-other young, men, mine had not been fo atrocious that I fhould fear to acknow-* ledge the word. In the age wherein we live, having been engaged with a miftrels I I thought would not be deemed an heinous crime; and a little fineffe at play has long been looked upon as a venial, fm at lead. I thought it bed therefore to confefs ingenuoufly to my father all
that.

one thefe ten years, for whofe fake he has abandoned his wife and family. Two thirds of the men of fafhion in France are equally culpable. Then as to play,

I could

[ i°9 }
t could have brought inftances enough? to £hew that fuch manoeuvres were not without example among people of fome? confideration.
But I had ftill honor enough left to difdain fuch an apology for adions I could not approve ; and therefore withr out attempting to palliate them, I ac-
✓
knowledged their difgraceful tendency, and owned I had nothing to offer as an excufe, but the violence of thofe pafTions that agitated me : vengeance and love !■ When I had finifhed what I had to fay, my father afked me again if I could tell him how to fet about procuring my re-

deliverance, it could come only from tBe family of De Malleville : but I imaginad that if he would take the trouble to fpeak to> old De Malleville himfelf, there would be no longer any impediment to my liberation. He promifed immediately to fet about it ; and I longed, but dared not venture to alk him to folicit the fame favor for Manon.
Tho’ I had now acquired courage enough to fpeak plainly to my father, I feared that fuch a^ propofal now, might give rife to fome refolution fatal to us both,. Perhaps this fear was the caufe of the misfortunes that happened afterwards,
i
by preventing my attempting to work.on the tendernefs of my father’s nature ; and at that time, when he was ■ already foftened,. to have excited his pity towards
my unfortunate Manon., I might then
have

have put him on his guard againft the' inveterate malignity of Gevres de Malle** v.ille:—malignity which made too deep an impreflion. I do not know, how I ought to have, adted. Let me have done what I would, perhaps my evil deftiny would equally have prevailed.
As foon as my ihther left me, he went to the houfe of Gevres de Malleville, and found him with his fon, to whom the suard who had undertaken to fecure
O
him had given his liberty the next morning. What pafled between my father and the two De Mallevilles at this con^ verfation I know noti but the event of it was fatal to my happinefs..

came to the Chatelet, and informed me
*
I was free ; and De Malleville made me a civil fpeech on what had pafted, and congratulated me on having fuch a father, whofe worthy example he . hoped I fhould for the future follow. My father ordered me to apologize to him for the injury which he pretended to have received, and thank him for procuring my releafe: and we went out all together,

My father having obliged me to fol-

I remembered that tho* to myfelf death would be a bleffing, my life was ftill ne-ceflary to Manon ; for that I only could , relieve her, and avenge her; and I fwore that my life fhould from that moment be dedicated to no other purpofe.

When I went ,out, I found the air gradually diminilhed the tumult of my boiling blood, and my fury began to fubfide. I confidered that if I could execute all I had threatened, it would be of no ufe to Manon, and would have deprived me of the power of afllfting her. And fhould I become an afTaffin ? for by aflalTination only could I avenge myfelf of the De Mallevilles. All I had to do then was to colled my utmoft refolution and coolnefs, to attempt
M anon’s

I faw but three per Ions from whom I could, expedt it *, De Tironx, my father, and Tibergej from the two latter I could, expedl nothing, if they fufpefled for what purpofe I wanted it ; and the-former I was afhamed to importune on fuch an occafion. However it was no time for fcruples, and defpair fuffered me not to hefitate.

I went to St. Sulpice, without caring whether I was known there or not, and fent for Tiberge, by whofe difcourfe I immediately difcovered that he knew nothing of my lad adventures. This made me change my defign of attempting to move his compaffion, and I only

He gave me his purfe, to. take what I would: I counted out the fum of five hundred livres, for which I offered him my note-, but he was too generous to accept it.
V
From thence I went to De Tiroux, with whom I had no referve, I related to him my misfortune in all its extent; with which indeed he was already acquainted, having never loft fight of me.
He heard me however with attention, and exprefied his concern; but when I afked him if he eould advile me how to procure the releafe of Manon, he told

De Tiroux was not at home; but after waiting fome moments he came in, and told me, with a melancholy air, that his negociation had fucceeded no better than ^ mine: he found young Gevres deMalle-ville lefs irritated than his father $ but

Nothing therefore now remained for me but to ti;y what could be done by force,, as De Tiroux had propofed and on that defperate undertaking refted my only hope.,
Alas! faid I to, De Tiroux, my fuccefs is very precarious but I lhali. have however one confolation; which is,, that if my attempt fails. I lhall probably-perifh in making it*.

I went to him, and defired he would give me leave to pafs the night in his room *, for 1 had never thought of procuring mylelf a lodging, and it was now fo late I knew not where dfe to go.
He exprefled great pleafure at feeing me once more at liberty, and offered me all the fervices in his power. I told'him how I was fituated, and the afliftance I wanted ; and though he faw the various hazards that attended fuch an undertaking, he was generous enough to engage in it, and fanguine enough to believe he could furmount them.

We employed part of the night in di-gefting our plan j and he feemed to think that the three foldiers who had before' been of his party might be depended upon. De Tiroux had informed me^ that-the guards appointed for the waggons, in one of which Manon was to go, were only fix; and we concluded that five of us. La Ferronaye, myfelf, and the three foldiers, would be equal to fix men, who probably would confult their own fafety more than fulfilling their charge. As I had money enough, La-Ferronaye advifed me to fpare none to promote my fuccefs. We muft have horfes provided, faid he, and each of us his muflcet and a brace of piftolsj all which, and fome other preparations, he undertook to have ready the next morning •, as well as to procure common cloaths for our foldiers, who dared not

For the pnrpofe of paying for thefe things, I gave him the hundred piftoles that De Tiroux had lent me, and he expended the whole in procuring what he thought requifite. The fpldiers palTed in review before me and I endeavoured to animate them by promifesthe better to confirm which, I gave each oi them ten, piftoles.
The day of a^ion being come, I fenfc one of them very early to the hofpital,, that we might be qttite fure of the moment of the convoys departure from, thence: and. tho’ this precaution feemed 'to arife from excels of anxiety,, I afterwards found it abfolutely necef-fary.

' Orleans. On the return of the foldier, however, I received politive aflfurances, that this \.mhappy company were to be carried thro’ Normandy, and to. embark at Havre de Grace for America.

We took different ways to our ren* dezvous, which was to be without the gate St.. Honore. We met accordingly^, with our horfes frefli and in good condition 5 and after waiting about ten minutes, we faw the waggons come flowly along, filled with the miferable women you faw at Pafly two years ago: a fight that almoft deprived me of my fenfes.

We conferred a moment on the beft method of beginning our attack; and ftiffered the carriages to proceed about two hundred yards before us: I thought that by eroding a little field, round which the road turned, we could throw our-felves between the guard and the waggons ; and La Ferronaye was of my opinion. I fpurred on my horfe, eagerly^^ but my evil genius ftill prevailed : The guard feeing five horfemen coming towards thern, believed they Ihould be attacked, and turned to defend them-felves with, a refolute air: making ready their bayonets and. pointing their pieces.

At this fight, which only animated me and La Ferronaye to begin the attack, the three cowardly aflbciates loft all difpolition to engage; and Hopping, as if by agreement,, turned their horfes round, and rode back towards Paris full fpeed. La Ferronaye checked his horfe, and feemed as much hurt as I was at this defertion. What are we about, faid he ? ’Tis defperation for us^ to think of attacking thefe fix mem Rage and delpair had deprived me of my voice. I flopped; not knowing whether I ftiould purfue the poltroons who had fled, or proceed to attack the guard: could I have done both, and had my power been equal to my rage,^,

I obtained leave of the guard to approach clofe to the waggon where fhe was. Ah ! what words can do juftice to my feelings at that moment 1 She fat on a little ftraw, with a heavy chain round her waift y her head leaning againfl the fide of the waggon: her face was pale, and wet with tears, which flowly fell from under her eye-lids, for her eyes were clofed. Her drcfs was negledled, and expreflive of her unhappy ftate: her f lovely hair hung loofely over her face and ihoulders : that beauteous face, and thofe delicate arms expofed to the inclemency of the weather ! The angelic form, lately

Overcome by her fufferings, ftie no / longer noticed any thing. She opened not her eyes, notwithftanding the noife made by the guard when they apprehended our falling on them ♦, and when I joined them, I rode for fome time by her ftde, gazing on her with fenfations of fuch horror that I was feveral times in danger of dropping from my horfe; but fhe faw me not. At length the deep fighs and groans that burft from my fwelling heart caught her ear : ftie knew my voice ; opened her eyes, and faw me 5

but that I would attach my deftiny wholly toher’s, follow her to America, and give up the reft of my life to prote6t and ferve her, the violent emotions of her gratitude and tendernels

h'Car her fay fhe loved me, was happi-ncfs which I would not have exchanged for any blcffing profperity could give. I had loft all that mankind calls good ; but the heart of Manon was mine, and I envied nobody. Whether I lived in Europe or America, was a matter of indifference if I could but live with her: wherever fhe was, was my country; and I thought any part of the univerfe would afford an afylum to two fuch hearts as our’s. But the fear of encountering the hardfhips of extreme penury, was ftill terrible when I confidered the weaknefs and delicacy of Manon. I reprefented to myfelf our fituation in an uncultivated region, where the conveniencies of life are wholly unknown, and even its. neceffaries hard to be procured among the favage inhabitants.

than my father and old De Malleville i they will not divide us, for they know »no laws but thofe of nature : their kearts are not hardened by avarice like De Malleville’s, or debauched by a falfe principle of imaginary honor, like that of my father. I fhould therefore, I thought, be content to live with them, far frorri , a country where I had experienced only cruelty and injuflice ; but hOw fhould t , procure for Manon the decencies, or even the abfolute requifites of life ? I knew from fad experience how dreadful
it was to fee a beloved objeft ftilfering

After the converfation that I have jufl: related with Manon, I went to the governor to defire him to confent to our
marriage : this however I fhould not have
%
done, if I had dared to 'flatter myfelf that his almoner who was the only priefl: in the town, would do me the kindnefs to perform the ceremony without his leave: but knowing I could not hope for his fecrecy or compliance, I thought it better to make no myftery about it. I found the governor accompanied only by his nephew *, and as i had no reafon to conceal what I had to fay from him, I ad-drefied myfelf to his uncle in his pre-fence *, I recounted a part of my hiflory,
to which he liftened with complaifance,
\
and when I befought him to confent to what I, afked, he not only aflured me of his ready concurrence, but that he would
himfelf be at the expence of the feflival VoL, II. H	which
k
\
1
/ >
which he would order in honor of the wedding. I went home well content with the fuccefs of my embalTy.
The nephew of the governor, whofe name was Synnelet, was extremely beloved by his uncle, whofe only relation ' he was. He was about thirty years old; brave, but pafTionate and violent. He was unmarried i and I found afterwards
i
that the charms of Manon had ftruck him the moment he faw her: and the frequent converfation he had had with her
fince, and the extreme beauty which re-
* %
turning health had reftored to her, had inflamed his paflion to a violent excefs *, but he had concealed it, believing as every body elfe did, that fhe was really my wife.
t
But he was no fooner undeceived than
he
‘ I
[	171	]
he threw off all reflraint. I had been . about an hour returned home, when the governor’s almoner came in, as 1 imagined, to give me fome advice previous to my marriage : but after a cold compliment, he told me in a few words that he waited on me by the governor’s order, to let me know I muft think no more of marrying Mademoifelle Manon, as the governor had other views for her.
s
r
Other views for Manon! exclaimed I,
<
Moniieur L’Aumonier ! What views ?
He anfwered, dryly, that I knew that Mademoifelle Manon was fent thither for
%
the Colony, and therefore the governor had a right to difpofe of her: believing
, us married, he had forborne to exert his
/
power; but now, as I owned we were no%
H 2	he '
s
m 4	M	V
he thought proper to give her to Monfieur Synndet, who was in love with her.
My paflion now again conquered my prudence. Regardlefs of their power, I fiercely ordered the almoner to go out of my houfe; and told him, that whether Manon was my wife or my miftrefs, neither the governor, Synnelet, nor the whole colony united, fhould dare to take her from me.
1 was obliged to communicate to Manon the ill omen’d meflage I had received ; and from many circumftances that we now recolledled, we concluded that Synnelet had long had an intention of appropriating her to himfelf, but could not till now find an opportunity of reducing his uncle’s integrity. But
«
what
%
[	173 ]
what was to be done ? He was powerful ; we were totally in his power •, and were at New Orleans as in a defart; having no refource or protedlion againft his tyranny. Through the dreary country which furrounded us, it was impofTi-ble to efcape •, and though the inhabitants were attached to me, I dared not hope • their fuccour could redrefs me: money would be necefiary to influence them, and I was poor: but even if I could have prevailed on them to revolt in my favor, which was next to impofiible,
their fuccefs was more than hazardous;
%
and the failure of fuch an attempt would only encreafe my misfortune. Thefe fchemes pafled rapidly thro’ my mind. I communicated them to Manon, and then, without waiting her anfwer, formed others. I thought firfb of one thing, then
of another, but could determine on
/
11 3	nothing
[	174 ]
nothing in a fituation fo fmgular thafc I had neither experience or example to aflift my refolution.
%
m
Manon, who attentively watched my eyes and the expreflion of my countenance, faw the misfortune that threatened us in all its extent; but the agitation flie faw mein wasfuch, that Ihetrembled to encreafe it by exprefling her fears.
\
After many abortive defigns, I determined to go to the governor, and try to move his pity, by reminding him of his former regard for me, and the refpefl I had ever teftified towards him .* but Manon oppofed my going, and with tears faid, Des Grieux, you are going to your death! I lhall fee you no more! Ah ! rather let me die in your arms, and my life will ftill end happily ! but do not, I implore you,, do not leave me ! With great
difficulty
[	175 ]
f
difficulty, however, I prevailed upon her to confent to my going, and affured her I would almoft immediately return to her. Ah! it was not my life, but her’s that Heaven demanded! That lovely and tender vidlim alone could be accepted as an atonement for our offences !
I went to the fort, and found the governor with his almoner. I humbled myfelf before him to a degree that the whole world ffiould not have bribed me to do if Manon had not been concerned.
I conjured him by every entreaty likely to move an heart which was not made of adamant, to compaffionate me: but he was immovable; and I could obtain
no other anfwer than that “ he was
1
I
“ mailer of Manon, and that he could “ not break the promife given to his “ nephew.” Still I determined to keep
H 4	my
%
[	>76 ]	'
my defpair within bounds, while moderation was likely to be of nfe; and 1 only' faid, on taking leave, that I could not believe him cruel enough to defire to deprive me of my life, to which I would much fooner confent than to the lofs of Manon.
I was too well convinced I had nothing to hope for from this obftinate old man, who was fo prejudiced in behalf of his nephew that he would have encountered perdition to gratify any wifh of his. Notwithftanding which,
I refolved to continue adling with all the coolnefs I could command ; determined, if they carried their injuftice to the laft excefs, to make in America one of the moft tragical fcenes that love and defpair had ever occafioned.
I was
I was’ returning home, meditating on what I had to do, when Fate, determined to haften my ruin, threw Synnelet in my way ; Vv^ho eafily read in my looks what palled in my ibul. k have already faid he had courage, 'which he was now determined to Ihew. Coming up to me with a fierce and menacing air, he faid, “ Do you, look for. me ? I know my “ defigns are offenfive to yon ; but fince “ I v/ill not relinquifli them, it will be necelTary for us to meaftire oun fwords. Gome then, let us fee who is: ‘‘ to be the happy polfelTor of Manond*'
I anfwered, that he was right j for that nothing but my death would oblige me. to refign her. We then retired together a Ibort diftance from the town, and drew-our fwords. ,I wounded and difarmed. him in an inftant, which enraged him fo.
H 5	much
- \
Hk*	w	wM
much that he refufed to afk his life, and ' to renounce for ever all pretenfions to Manon.
I fliould perh^s have been juftified in taking it from him; but noble blood fcorns to difgrace itfelf by taking an ungenerous advantage. I threw him his fword. Let us begin again then, faid r, and remember it is to be decifive.
He then attacked me with incredible fury; and as I was by no means expert
t
at the fword, (having had only three months pradice at Paris) he in his turn ran me thro* the arm j but in confequence of this advantage, and of his increafing paffion, he grew fo un«-guarded, that prelTing on him, I gave ; him a fatal lunge, and run him quite through the body: he ftaggered a feyv paces, and fell motionlefs at my feet.
Tho’
%
L •■i'J J
Tho’ my firft emotion was that of
ft
joy. at my vidory, yet L . refledlcd almoft immediately on its cohfequences, and confidered that I fhould be punilhed without mercy,, and without delay. Knowing the infatuation of the governor for his nephew, I doubted not but that I lliould meet with inftant death as foon as that of Synneler fhould be known. Nor was that the worft of my fears: Manon, abandoned and friend-lefs, in a defolate country, was an idea infinitely more dreadful-, fo much fo, that it almolt deprived me of my fenfes, and made me carelefs of my immediate fafety.
I hung in blent horror over the corps
' ,*T*
before me,whole ftate I envied-, for hadiiis
ft
lot been mine I had been delivered from
all my miferies. However ^the thought
that
that occafioned my greateft uneafinefs, at length roufed me to take fome refo-lution. How! cried I to myfelf, fhall i die to efcape from prefent evil? Is there any evil then greater than the lofs of her I love ? Ah 1 let me brave every danger to affift my unhappy girl! it will be always time enough to die, when I have attempted every thing in vain !
I went home ♦, where I found Manon half dead with fear and anxiety. At my prefence Ihe revived •, but the terrible accident that had happened, and which I could not conceal from her, threw her into an agony of terror. Before I had finifhed my relation of the death of Synnclet, and the wound I had received, jQie fell almoll lifelefs into my arms; and it was more than a quarter of an hour before her fenfes returned.
I was
V
I
I was myfelf half dead : I faw not the lead; probability of feeurity for either of us. Manon, faid I, as foon. as fhe feemed a little recovered, what fhall we do ? Alas! Whither fhall we go I It is neceffary that I immediately quit the town. Will you ftay in it ^ Ah, yes ! flay ! flay 1 I befeech you ! you may yet be happy ! while 1 will go to meet death
among the favages; of the defart, or in
0
the jaws of fome ferocious animal! Weak and trembling, llie arcfe, and catching me eagerly by the hand, led me to the door.. Let us fly, faid flie: the corps of Synnelet may already have been found, and we may a moment hence have no time to efcape. But my foul! replied I, wildly, whither! whither can-we go ? What refource have we ? Would it not be better for you to .endeavour to live here without me, while
I oficr
/
I
I offer myfelf a voluntary viftim to the. governor’s fury ? This propofal only augmented her anxiety to depart. She went out, and I followed her, having fo much prefence of mind left as to put a bottle or two of fpirits in my pockets, and as much provifion as they would hold. We told our fervants we-were going out for our evening walk;/ and we hurried out of the town much, fafter than I could have fuppofed Manon able to walk.
Though I was flill in the. moft painful irrefolution where to go, two feeble rays of hope broke a little the gloominefs of my defpair; without theaffiftance of which I Ihould, have preferred inftant death to the dread of what might befall Manon: While I had been in America I had
acquired
I
acquired fome knowledge of the country, and was acquainted with the manner in which the Indian nations are conciliated ; and I knew I might with certain precautions put myfclf into their hands without meeting certain deftru6lion. I had learned a little of their manners and cuftoms, and fomething of their language, in the frequent opportunities I had had of feeing them trading at New Orleans j and added to this melancholy refource, I had hopes of another, which was from the Englifh, who have, as well as ourfelves, fettlements in that part of America. But when I confidered that to reach their colonies we muft traverfe immenfe defarts, unknown to cultivation, and go for many days thro’ woods, never pafled but by the wandering Indians, and over fteep and almoft inaccefllble mountains, a journey which

We walked: on as long as Manon’s^ flrength would permit : I believe about fix miles •, for fhe courageoufly refufed. to flop, as long as fhe could fupport her-felf. Overcome at length with fatigue,.
fhe was forced to acknowledge fhe could, po no farther. We were then in the-

I fhould have overwhelmed her with

forrow if I had refufed to fulfer her
%
to attend to my eafe before fhe thought of her own: I therefore fubmitted for fome moments to her tender attention, and filently fubmitted to her application of the remedies wherewith fhe had fur-nifhed herfelf. But when her affedtion had had its courfe, with what ardor did I not return it! 1 took off my cloaths to fpread them under her, that fhe might not fuffer from the dampnefs of the ground •, and notwithftanding her entreaties, obliged her to let me ufe every means to make her fituation lefs inconvenient. I warmed her hands with fighs and kiffes ; and making my knees her pillow, I prepared to watch over
her
%

her the whole night*, befeeching Heaven
I
to proted: her, and give her calm and refrefhing repofe. Oh God!	how
ardent were- my prayers for her prefer-Vation! and wherefore did thy rigorous judgments ordain them to be fruit-lefs !
^Forgive me,df I conclude in a few words, a recital that would kill me; an event without example ; and of which I (halt carry to my grave the bitter remem-brance. But though I bear the recol-ledion of this dreadful fcene inceflantly in my bofom, my foul recoils every time I attempt to relate it.
We had pafled a part of the night tranquilly. I thought my beloved Manon fiept, and was almofl afraid of breathing, lead: it Ihould difturb her, when towards
day-
[ J
day-break I felt her hands very cold, and found they trembled extremely. 1 put them to my bofom; fhe was fenfible of what i did, and taking my hand, told me in a feeble voice that Ihe believed her lafl: moments were approaching. I thought this language natural, after the fatigue and terror Ihe had undergone j and I endeavoured to comfort and re-aflure her by the tendered: careffes. But her frequent Ihort lighs, her filence when I fpoke to her, and the convulfive catch-ings of her hands, which I held in mine, made me too well underftand that the end of her miferies was near. Aik me not what I then felt, or what were her laft
words. She died !----.J faw her die !—
ftill endeavouring to exprefs her love to me !	1 can tell you no more of what
pafled at that moment!———She died !-— and I ftill live ! Heaven having judged
my

my piinifhment yet infufRcient,, has dcr. creed that I fliall continue to drag on a
O
languifhing and painful exiftence !
\
/
For above four and twenty hours after her death, I remained with my face clofe to her cold cheek. I meant to die, and never to quit that pofture. But on the beginning of the fecond morning, I re^ membered that when I was dead the body of my beloved miftrefs might become the prey of wild beads, I determined to bury her, and wait for death on her grave. I was already fo exhaufted by grief and want of food, that it was with infinite efforts I arofe from the ground. I was obliged to have recourfe to the cordials I had brought with me, and was refreflied enough to enable me to begin the mournful ofifice.
The
L 1^9 J
The whole plain being a bed of deep fand, I found it eafy to dig, and I broke my fword to remove it ^ but found my hands more ferviceable; and with great labour, as my weaknefs obliged me often to ftop, I at length made a deep grave; and having wrapped all my cloaths round her, to prevent the fand from touching her, I placed in it the idol of my foul;
after having embraced her a thoufand
/■
times, and fpeaking to her as if fine was
yet alive. But having depofited her in
# ^
it, I flill hung over her, being unable to fummon refolution enough to throw the earth pipon her. Feeling however my weaknefs return, I feared that death might prevent my performing for her this laft fad fervice : therefore colledling all my ftrength and refolution, I began to fill the grave, and bury in the bofom of the earth the loveiieft and moft amiable
\
/
L	J
ble creature it had ever boafled. Haviag done this, I laid down on the grave, with my face turned towards the fand which covered her, and Ihutting my eyes in the hope to open them no more, I implored of Heaven fpeedily to fend me the death I fo ardently wifhed for.
During all this terrible fcene, no tear fell from my eyes; no figh efcaped my heart. My fenfes feemed locked up in the greatnefs of my calamity ; and pof-jfeffed of a heady refolution to die, I uttered no complaint, nor Ihed any outward fymptom of the horror and confter-nation of my foul. After having lain fome time in the manner I have de-fcribed, I loft all recolledion, and felt my mifery no longer.
The reft of my melancholy ftory is hardly worth your attention. The body
of
\
I
of Synnelet being carried to the town, and his wounds examined, it was found he was not only alive, but that none of his wounds were mortal. He told his uncle ingenuoufly what had happened, and had generofity enough to do juftice to my conduft. An enquiry was immediately made for me j but I was gone. It was too late to learch for me out of the town that night; and for two days ‘ their endeavours to find me did not fuc-
y
ceed: but on the evening of the third I was difcovered on the grave of Manon ; fenfclefs, almofl without cloaths, and covered with blood from^ r>iy wound: and thofe who found me itnao-ined from
-	^	o
my appearance that I had been robbed
\
and murdered. They carried me as well as they could towards the town ; and the motion brought me to myfelf. The fighs and groans I uttered on finding
[	>92 ]
/
iftg myfelf ftill among the living, firft informed them I might be reftored by their alTidance; dn giving me which they fucceeded but too well. But not-withftanding my deplorable condition, I was fent to prifon, and clofely confined in a dungeon; for when Manon could no where be found, they believed I had
killed her in a tranfport of jealous rage,
/
foon as I was able, I recounted fimply and naturally all that I remembered to have happened; and truth had its efiedt. Synnelct, unhappy as the event had made him, was generous enough to intereft himfelf for me, and obtained my releafe : but I was fo weak,
i
that when they took me from my dungeon I was carried to bed, where I lay for three months, fometimes fenfible, but oftener in an happy forgetfulnefs of all my forrows.
When
I
[ I $3 ]
When I poflcffed my recollection, life grew more and more infiipportable to me, I called perpetually on death, as the only end of my mifery j and when I had the power to refufe, I refufed all fuccour. But Heaven having fo feverely punilhed me, now fullered me to profit
f
from its chaftifement. The remembrance of what I had been, and what I ought to be, returned j and as my yoiith and
a very good conftitution in fpite of my
«
affliction, by degrees furmounted my dif-eafe, reafon returned with returning health. I entered again on the duties of my employment, waiting ’till a velTel fliould arrive from France, which is ex- . peCted there only once a year, I refolved to return to my native country, and by my future conduCt endeavour to repair the errors of my former life. For my poor

Manbn I could now do no more : during my illnefs Synnelet had taken care to have her remains removed to the town,
and interred in the church with every mark of refpeft.
About fix weeks after I left my bed, I was walking alone on the beach, and difcovered a fail, which I found to be a fmall veflel come to trade at New Orleans. I ftood to fee the debarkation, and with extreme furprife faw Tiberge among thole who came on Ihpre. This faithful friend knew me afar off; tho* grief and illnels had very much altered my appearance. He embraced me, v/ith tears, and told me the only motive of his voyage was to try to engage me to return to France. As foon as he received my letter, he fet out himfelf to bring me the afiiftance 1

pirate, and carried to one of their iflands,

from whence with great difficulty he efcaped, and after various accidents got on board the little floop which now fo happily landed him at New Orleans.
