art of giving youth a proper idea of the world, without the danger of imbibing its vices. Above all, he is to be admired for the regard he pays to the principle oi honour—that fa-iCred tie, which is the bond of virtue between man and man.
You have often heard me Speak of his Lordship’s brother. He was a Soldier, in the truest and most relpedt-able Senfe of the appellation. Many a campaign have we fought fide by fide; nor shall I forget while I live, that fatal morning which feparated

with all that compofure which mark&

true valour, he led his valiant little troop to ruin, to defeat, on Saratoga's fatal plain—there, where imprudent valour and mistaken meafures gave the first great check to the fuccefs of the British arms, a hero, among heroes, he fell, ere vitstory had yet declared for the enemy. O, Frank, excufe my warmth; excufe me when I mourn at once over my country and my friend: Yet why mourn over him} he fell as a Soldier should do.

^'T^HE comments which you made,.
dear Jack, were no more than I might have expelled. The Coloners observation naturally drew upon him your cenSure: yet my uncle is a worthy character, and you may occa-fionally give him credit for Some good qualities, on my report, which one day you will, perhaps, be con-vinced that he poflefles.

12 THE TRIUMPHS
The degree of re Sped: due to our relations, is a Subjed which I do not mean here to diScuSs. As to your good kinsfolks, they have their Singularities ; So have most women vvhen they arrive at the other fide of fifty. It is rather unhappy that theSe Should excite - difgust in j/oit: to me they have often proved rather matter of entertainment.
All the news I can impart to you from the Land of Love is, that my incognita^ as I termed her, my Arne--lia, remains as tranquil as possible, at Mrs. Sibley’s ;:, only I think Sometimes fhe feemis rather rufssed at the notion of being in Something like a-
i
state of dependance, though the uSes as little as possible of my proffered
assistance,

astistance. But there are Some things in her condudf, of which I Should be glad to get an explanation.
For instance, when I went to vifit her yesterday, I found her in conference with an elderly w'oman, who arofe, as if impatient to depart, as Soon as I entered the room. I wished to know Somewhat of this vifitor; but as I had made a fort of promife to Amelia, when first she trusted her-
felf to my protedlion, not to be in-
#
quifitive, I appeared Satisfied with what information she choSe to give me; which amounted to no more than that this woman v/as the ferv-ant of a former acquaintance, whom she had met by chance, and brought home with her. I thought Amelia
told
14 THE TRIUMPHS
✓
told me She had no acquaintance in
\
town X. I GonfeSs I was not pleaSed with her having Such a vifitor.— There was another matter that I could liot but notiee; which was, that this morning,, coming, Suddenly into the room as the door stood open, I Surprised her reading a paper, (I cannot be Sure whether it were a letter or not), with apparent emotion. She Seemed too as if She had been weeping.. I aSked whether stie was any way indiSpofed.—She anSwered
in the negative; and fell into a diS-courfe on indifferent matters, without giving the most distant hint that any thing had disturbed her. What Seems extraordinary is, that in the midst of this veil of Secrecy, Amelia has

Such an air of native fimplicity, as fpeak her above deceit. But it is one thing, to conceal—another, to

hQ fraudful. I have Said, I trust this girl has not any difpofition to the latter, which is, undoubtedly,, the worst charadter that any female (not to Say a mistreSs in particular) can. ever polTeSs.
I heartily with you mirth and recreation at Bellgrove-Place, where you will have your nymphs, your Shady groves. Smooth lawns, and cooling fountains; whilst I am cooped up in the Smoky town, and have no prolpedl of enjoying mySelf in the country, even during the long vacation, which is very hard, confidering “ what a dry study this Law is,*’

I cannot help thinking, Frank, that, being unprovided as you are. Lord Bell grove’s will be as likely

MISS CAROLINE STANMORE TO MISS
ELIZA ELLIS.,
Marlborough, May the aift.
TT is an age, my Dear, fince I have heard from you ; and, believe me, I have felt much fince from your Silence, as you are Senfible you were ever next my heart; and, if I know it aright, you will ever remain So. Indeed I have always conceived, though with fubmifiion to the opinion of my elders, and thofe< whofe greater famL Harity of life should ripen their judgment.

merit, that connexions of this kind,, formed in youth, are most likely, to prove strong and lasting; and that,, as a modern Poet Says,
\
No after friend/hip e’er can raife Th’ affeftion of our earlier days.”
The rest of the stanza I do- not pretend to paSs a judgment on, but am inclined to take the author’s word for it, though written in a style of lamentation. Such as people are apt to indulge, when they mourn over the remains of departed pleafures.
After all, my Dear, why is age to be deplored—^I mean by fuch as have Spent the morning of life, in attending to the dictates of wiSdom I Suppofe all that can be Said in this
refpect,.

refpect, is, that it is one of the weak-nefles of our nature, over which but few can triumph.
In my last I told you, I expelled to go on a party to Lord Bellgrove’s, by her Ladyship’s invitation: I should have dated this from Bellgrove Place* but for my mother’s being indifpofed. That best of parents, who wishes me to take every innocent recreation, was urgent with me to go, but I deferred it; for I could taste no pleafure while I knew she was experiencing the flightest degree of pain. Eliza, she is fo good a mother, that all the encomiums I have ever pasted on her, fall far short of what she deferves.— Were she otherwife, I should always account fuch conduct as a duty—but

now it is enforced bv filial love. As to my father, you know him, hasty in his temper, but affedlionate, and capable of all the noble feelings of the heart. His abfence, however, at this juncture, rendered my prefence the more neceffary. I thought I could do for my mother what no nurSe nor hired attendant could perform. To footh the bed of ficknefs is the proper part of the nearest and dearest relation. This was my endeavour; and I flatter mySelf that I have contributed to the re-establiSh-ment of her health who is fo dear to me. A few minutes ago I parted from her, and was happy to fee her appear with all her wonted chear-fulneSs.

The indiSpofition of a parent occasioned you, my Dear, to defer your vifit to Bellgrove-Place.—An indif-pofition of mine prevented my writing to my friend, the fister of my choice; and this I attribute chiefly^ to my uncle’s hastening me with the rest of the family to the metropolis, for he never can think of leaving one behind him, at least one who wears petticoats. Some affairs of his own, which he did not chufe to communicate, caufed this journey, the fuddennefs of which, and the hurry it occafioned, were too much for one whofe fpirits often exceed her strength—this, by the bye, as a fort of fide-wind felf-commendation.— But So it was ; and my good kinf-VoL.

world, and left by him to whom I

Sliould have looked up for assistance, to Seek my fortune where I could find it; with finances too trifling to be mentioned; without prefent friends or future dependance;—with a Spirit too proud to be Servile; a difpofition,

the aflistance of thoSe whom I remembered among my acquaintance.
I shall never forget, that Such was my fituation, when first I formed a friendly connexion with you, who did not, like the many, fly from my wants, but, with equal freedom, imparted your advice and affistance.
From the moment I Saw you, I thought I perceived that in your diS-pofition which gave me the rational expectation of your being one, from whom a generous Spirit might with honour receive an obligation.—My

Subsequent distreffed condition at | B—, (which put me in mind of ' the unhappy Mr. Savage’s last stage) and your well-timed aid confirmed me in the propriety of that opinion.

Yes I you restored me to hope, whilst an unnatural relation would have been glad to hear that I was buried in defliair—It was then first I ventured to call you Friend; to how few can we with propriety give that appellation !
But to proceed with what you are kindly Solicitous in enquiring:—The whole time I Spent in London was about three months ; in the courfc
of which, I complied with your advice, and commenced a Suit at law against the perSon who, with Such cruelty and contempt, denied my just demand, and wished to shelter him-Self by legal equivocation. But matters Seem far from coming to an istue. This man is determined to stand it

but there was one, the want of which I regretted, the preSence of the only man in whom I can repofe the confidence of friendship.^—It is true I let few opportunities paSs of enjoying the Social hour with the best acquaintance I could find; but I will own freely, whether from a real or fuppofed knowledge of the world, as it is called, I was almost afraid to examine any farther than the fuper-
ficlal appearance and profeshons of
my companions, lest I might have found Something to allay the temporary enjoyment, and thus should have been difagreeably compelled to acknowledge, that “ happineSs is but
opinion.”
With
I
/
OF FORTITUDE. 4^5
With regard to Taste, the faShions, and the variety of bagatelles that engage the modisti world, they appear
to move on in the uSual round. There
\
is a kind of routiney that no doubt, my dear Sir, you have obferved, by which thefe matters are calculated to involve themSelves. As one bubble breaks, another riSes: thus they’’ go on, like wave impelling wave ; and thus, perhaps, it is neceffary that they Should; but yet I would wisti always to keep a steerage, rather than r
I
to be carried away by the stream of dissipation.
As the Peace has returned upon our hands a great number of thofe, formerly So ufeful in fighting the battles of this country, I conceive it would
conduce
46 THE T R I U M P H S
conduce both to the honour oS Go» vernment and the advantage of the country, to procure them employment, or otherwise to provide for them.
What led me into this refiedion was, that in the courSe of my perambulations, I met with a Sailor, (a native of Wales) who told me a piteous tale of his being preffed at the beginning of the war, upon information, and the conSequent distreffes to which, it Seems, his wife and a young infant were reduced, both of whom died during his abSence, in the work-houfe. He added, a very common complaint—-indeed too common— of the delay of a payment in refined: of a fmall Sum of prize-money
«
due

due to him. He Said he was not bred to any trade, but had Saved a little money in Service, and had put his wife into a retale bufinefs, of a nature in which he could occafi-onally be ufeful, ( having it at his option to rcfume his former mode of getting his livelihood) had not this circumstance happened to him. The
man was not v^/^ounded, nor any way fo difabled as to la}^^ claim to a pen-fion; but, through ficknefs and want, was brought to a state that had reduced him almost to a fkeleton. Yet, having a fpirit which caufed him to
fcorn the idea of afking alms while , there was yet the fmallest poifibility of finding any other means of fub-fistance, he barely existed by carrying

out Small parcels; not having proper requifites to enter into Service, as hei Said, with any degree oS decency or[

propriety.
Accustomed to calamities, I should:

tune,—Finding the man Senfible, and deeming him worthy of relieS, 1
[
gave him a Small matter, and ordered him to come to me at a certain time. I I was then in want of an attendant, therefore having enquired into Some particulars that he had communicated, I found them true, and made him an offer of entering into my Service, which he readily accepted.— Thus, I believe, I have in Some degree administered to the neceshties
of

of a fellow-creature, and, in all probability, procured a faithful fervant.
I have in pradlice followed the maxim I always wished to adopt—“ That he who has but little power of doing ** good, should be careful not to let “ flip any opportunity of exercifing it “ in the best manner he is able.’h
I cannot conclude this letter without doing myfelf the fenfible pleaSure to inform you that MiSs Sandby is in health, and defired, by her coufiii, to be remembered to you, as do the rest of your friends and acquaintance in the metropolis.

Lady Bellgrove fays this youth is a phce-nomenon.—Her Lady Ship has Seen him more than once, and knows Some who have been intimate with
t
him. According to this lady’s account, there is Something remarkable in his history. Perfecutcd by a brother, he has been expoSed to many hardships in life, and, poffested as he is of Spirit, and all the feelings

Prepare to hear Something that you will wonder at, my Dear, though there is no miracle; nothing out of the common order of events, in the matter.—It is briefly this. The Honourable Mr. Merton is arrived, and has brought with him Some friends as he promised, among whom is the identical young gentleman, concerning whom you rallied me in your last letter—the youth we Saw at

Bristol, whom we remarked to have Something equally amiable and de-jeded in his appearance. He is now

after the arrival of theSe gentlemen and two ladies, a fresh company was announced. They confisted of gay young men. Such as in the days of Romance, we might have SuppoSed to break a lance in honour of the ladies at the festival. The leader of this train was Mr. Holton, brother of

His Lordship has just taken Mr. Merton afide, begging the excuSe of the company, as he has Something particular to communicate. Probably

As it is likely there are other points that Charles may have in view, where he appears only to fpend a few days upon invitation, it is necestary to keep a watchful eye over him. In particular, any alliance of conSequence by marriage might prove troublefome; and with his figure and infinuating ad-dreSs, he may bring Something oSthis kind to bear. You know well how he has thwarted me; So, James, “one ** good turn deServes another,” as

Seems to entertain a jea-louSy of this fort, though he strives to hide it under a veil of reSpect and politeneSs. But the evil paffions in the human mind will often disturb the greatest apparent felicity.
Mr. Merton, who returned just in time for our evening repast, as I thought, with care on his brow, the night I wrote last to you, appears to have cleared up his countenance,
while his friend preServes an equality

I shall not repeat that you are a mad girl, Eliza,; but I shall obferve you have properly determined to fuS-pend your judgment concerning any
thing that relates to him whom you

Seeing me, as I am, almost the only female standing, as it were, alone, except what I owe to the countenance of his parents, in this great company. But it was a fingu-larity of my mother's, (herSelf not venturing to accompany me) not to
put me under the eScort or care of
«
any other, except Lord and Lady Bellgrove, to whom, by letter. She most affectionately recommended me.
Without diffimulation,Eliza, I cannot help thinking that you, or any person poffeffed of feelings, might well experience a ** touch of the condition” of Such a worthy youth as Mr.

At least, my Eliza is not So unhappy as to have Persecutors to deal with; in that there is Some comfort j and it is known that your relations, however fufpicious you have reafon to conceive they are of your conduct, fpeak of you in the highest terms.

What are many of the articles of decorum So univerfally Subscribed to by our Sex, but as many restraints; yet how poor a figure Should we cut without them? At this time, my Dear, I am not contending with impetuous passions, that often prove too strong for our frail nature; I am only reminding you, as, I believe, in your coolest hours oS

that I account you of the number.
All is happineSs and gaiety here, and in order to make my Self welcome, I was not backward in bringing with me Some who were ready to join the

pleaSure-loving train ; and I received the thanks and enjoyed the Smiles of
m
the company, in conSequence of that obligation.
There have been a matrimonial Eu-logium, and an Ode recited here; the jirft I have not heard; but it is to be repeated; the lafi^ compoSed in honour of the young Lord Mountfort’s birthday, was a tolerable compofition of a poor Poet, who, as I Suppofe, was
well rewarded for his trouble.—All

this, to vary our entertainments.—I could wish you were here, Frank; but I SuppoSe you are buSy with your incognita; however you will do well not to make too ferious a bufineSs of that connexion. In what fimplicity of heart you exprefs your wonder

It is most likely you disappointed the lady, who had Some pretty story to tell you if you had infisted on knowing the contents, which, it may be reasonably SuppoSed, were framed to anfwer Some particular purpole,— I did not Speak out So freely before, becaufe I thought it would be ufe-lefs, till you had Some fair caufe to awaken Sufpicion in your breast.— Now that is furely the cafe, perhaps you will listen to a friend.—Prove her, try her to the utmost before you accept her as a mistrefs, for furely you cannot think of her in any other

which I hope fhe will be deceived.
\
—If fhe is what I SuppoSe, and what indeed you might have judged from the place where you found her, you cannot have her too cheap: I have known Some tales as romantic
end thus; and there is no trusting to
*
mysteries.
Amongst the company here, we have a younger brother that, I believe, would fain be in the place of the e/der, I take him to be one of
thoSe
♦
\

thoSe pretenders to virtue who are endued with many vices. This young
I
man, whoSe name is Balil, stands in
*
the relation of a brother to a Baronet, with whom (having offended him by ’ Some misbehaviour) he is in diSgrace. And therefore he is confidered by fomeas a living martyr to the other’s
f
perfecutions. 'But as no caufe is af-figned for this conduD, on the part of the complainant, I think the wife part of the world may fafely conclude him to be in the v/rong. His prefence here is owing to Something like a Self-invitation—a friend of his has introduced, or intruded him upon us.
He appears to be much refpedted by Lord Bellgrove, and takes Some pains to get into the good graces of the VoL. L	E	heir,

who poffeffes uncommon vivacity, and Some degree of coquetry; the Ladies Lucy and Mary Barton ; the Mifs Elfords, and though last, not least in the account; Mifs Caroline Stanmore, a young beauty, who would be perSedlly amiable, were she not of a turn too Serious; though, at

Mountfort, I am Sometimes inclined to think, wishes to be rather parti™ cular with her, which may pafs the more eaSily, as she is under the Sole proteDion of his parents. If he were ever So much in earnest, Mifs Stan-more will appear not to understand him. As to Lord and Lady Bell-grove, I don’t perceive they apprehend any Such matter. They willi

a distant relation, polTeffed of a

To tell thee truly, Frank, *—^ . stie is that fort of beauty, notwithstanding the fault that I have found with her, that I Should be happy in postefiing; and were her fortune equal to my expeDations, I know not whether I Should fcrupie to makji her my wife. As mv affairs now

stand, they require affistance of that

Frank, as much friends as we are, I stiould find infinitely more pleafure in writing and converfing with thee, if it were not for Some thread-bare notions that form the habits of one who ought to be more a man of the world than to give way to them.
I Shall take the first opportunity of Sending the books I promifed.— Read them with attention, and I doubt not but they will greatly contribute to the removal of thofe prejudices which ill become the polisti of good breeding, and the freedom that marks a liberal education.

Mrs. Randal, which happened at the worst of times for. me, I had Sustained inconveniencies, and buffetted tempests in vain, when I found I was left defolate in a country, of which I had been told I was a native.

and, befides, appeared to be the only perfon capable of pointing out the method of procuring a future Support.

OF FORTITUDE. ^17
After affording me every afiistance in your power, I have, to acknowledge your recommendation of me
toCapt. T-----'s family, in quality
of companion to his lady.
For Some time, all things went
on well there. Mrs. T------was as
kind a lady as could be imagined, and I had every reaSon to think that I should live happy in my station.
f
It was not long, however, before I perceived Such difpofitions as were likely to Sow the feeds of difcord
there. Capt. T-----was addidtcd to
roving, and his wife gave herfelf up to jealoufy; all which, however, I
I
conceived would not afihdt me, and consequently gave me no other concern, than iuch as Sometimes refulted
from,
/
t
110	1 H ii; 1 K 1 U M r H s
from being an involuntary witneSs of the anxieties in which it involved them.
But, I had not been thus Situated above two months, before I obServed the Captain took'particular notice of me, whenever he could find me alone. A distant reSpedt was the return I made, which kept him aloof for Some time; but as he was one of thofe men whom difficulties do not daunt in their purSuits, neither this behaviour, nor my afterwards Shunning his preSence, in a studied manner, ;had the defired effedl. He followed me wherever he found an opportunity, and befides attempted to take liberties with me, that conScious modesty, and the regard which I
owed
OF FORTITUDE. II9
owed mySelf and my fituation, oc-cafioned me, in Some meaSure, to rc-Sent. Piqued at this behaviour, the
gentleman had, for Some time, left
/
off troubling me. But,, when I thought I Should be entirely rid of this embaraffment, and concluded that his good Senle had Shewn him the impropriety of his condudt, I was Surprised, on entering a room that led towards my lady’s chamber, to See him Suddenly standing at my fide.—I would have withdrawn, but
f
he prevented me. Saying, Amelia, I must infist on your staying a mo-“ ment, for I have Something of a “ Serious nature to propoSe for your
“ consideration; I know you are a
■%
girl of good SenSe, and therefore
“ I ex-
iZU	± n Hy J.	± ivx A XA O
“ I expect you to determine accord-inglyc”
After many compliments paid to my perfon, he introduced a propofal of keeping me as a mistrefs, on a
I
stipend of 200I. per annum, at a place fome miles .distant from the town, where he could vifit me oc-castonally. He infisted on my hearing a recital of the plan he had formed for this purpofe. I did So, with reluctance, and in anSwer told him, I was forry he had fpent his time to fo little purpofe, in framing a defign that could never be put in execution. Having now given an abfolute denial to his propofal; h return for the liberty he had taken
/
with me, I made fo free as to remonstrate

strate on the irhpropriety oS his conduct, as it reSpedfed his Lady. He

affedted a Smile of contempt at Such
preaddingy as he termed it, and Slid I was a fool to refufe a good offer, which I should hereafter wish I had accepted. But, finding his words had no weight with me, he withdrew; and I once more fancied I had Sebn and heard the end of his importu-nities.-----
While the Captain was thus pur*
%
Suing what he termed the objedt of
his defires, I conceived his Ladv

viewed me with the eye of Sufpicion. How^ever, I found I shared more of her favours and confidence in this reSpedt, (if I might trust to profeS-fions) than I could well have ex-Vo l, I,	F	pedled
pe<5ted from a perSon of her diSpofi-tion.
She called me one day into her clofet, and, after bestowing Some commendations on me, told me she had reaSon to think her hushand had Some defigns on me. “ I do not Say So, child,’" added She, “ from any “ thing that I apprehend as yet has ‘‘ pasted between you, nor the cauSe “ I have to SuppoSe that you would “ willingly give encouragement to “ fuch advances; but I draw this ** conclufion from Symptoms I ob> Serve in his behaviour, with which . “ I think I am well acquainted.— “ As the matter is entirely involun-'	“ tary on your fide, fb you may de-

DiSpleaSed as I had been with the Captain’s infamous propoSals, yet I was glad his Lady’s fuSpicions reached no farther than I conceived they did by her fpeech; fince the latter end of it pointed out to me how improper it would be to place the confidence in her that She required, as it was likely to turn out to her own unhappinefs, and to blow the coals of contention In the family.
. For fome time my married lover forbore his troublefome addresses, and as I really thought, Seemed to treat me with Somewhat bordering on contempt, which in that only instance would have proved agreeable. But he was fuch a master of artifice, that it was quite eafy for him to
deceive

went with them. Here I began to

I was left in the houle, with only two female Servants. TheSe, together with a footman whom the Captain brought with him, now made up the little family of which I acted as mistreSs ; and he declared he was charmed wdth the manner in which I acquitted mySelf; adding, that he should always fay my virtue was equal to my accomplishments, and

the day fixed for his departure, he • entered the room where I was fitting alone, and began a conversation with me on indifferent matters, to which I endeavoured to put a period as Soon as possible, and made a motion to withdraw j but this he prevented by getting between me and the door; and then (turning the difcourSe) he renewed the propofals which I had

Some stories likewiSe of his gallantry, and Seemed rather disappointed that I was not highly entertained by them.
Vfhile we were difcourfing. Sir George entered, as it was probably defigned he Should j and I was not Suffered to withdraw. He did not behave in So odd a manner as ushal, which Served only to strengthen me in the opinion that much of this fin-gularity was affumed; what followed put the matter beyond a doubt; for Mrs. Croshy and her daughter leaving the room on various pretences, he no Sooner found himfelf alone

t
but if he could get a fair friend and constant companion to astbciate with, he would maintain her in affluence, and treat her with all the refpedl and tendernefs her heart could wish.— From the manner in which all this was delivered, it was evident for whom the bait was thrown out: but I would not appear to understand the drift of it, till the Baronet brought
it So clofe as, to intimate that Such a

fituation was at my Service if I chofe to accept it. As it would have been mere filly affectation to pretend ignorance any longer, I contented my-Self with thanking him coolly for his offer, which, I Said, I could not have the honour to accept; but I doubted not of his finding thofe in
this great city who would be ready enough to meet his wishes. Attempting to prefs the matter further, I anfwered in a manner So- determined as Seemed rather to mortify Sir George;, who thought proper to change the difcourfe—And after havr ing drank tea with the rest of the family, he went away in Seeming good humour.

April 2^,
¥ KNOW not yet, my dear Ma-

with me. However, I ought to be

PurSuant to my intention, I had but just difpatched my last to you when I gave Mrs. Croshy warning, in preSence of her other lodger.—I could perceive (he was So much vexed, that it was with difficulty She
N
restrained her riSing paffion. She afked what I had to find fault with in her houSe, and before I could return an anSwer, this, her coufin, as fhe is called, began an harangue in praife of the accommodations. Unwilling to enter into any altercations, I only Said that I found it neceffary to change my fituation, in which, being but a weekly lodger, I thought I might ufe my pleaSure without giving her any just cauSe of offence.*—?
“ Oh

“ than you may at my houSe.”—I then told her, as to bufineSs, I doubted not but I Should find a Sufficiency

to Supply my wants, which were moderate, elSewhere, as well as there —that as to any thing farther, I was obliged to her for all favours, and would make her what amends She pleaSed for any extraordinary trouble or other matter of the kind. She

From this time, I reshlved to keep my Self as recluSe from company as I -could during my Short stay in the houfe. I thought the landlady had Spoken pretty plainly, and, indeed, I would willingly have Shortened that period, but that I feared a quarrel with Such people, in my lone

fituation. Mrs. Croshy, however. Smoothed her brow, was particularly complaisant to me whenever we met; and invited me down stairs as before, yet did not Seem angry at my re-fuSals. Thus, three days out of the Seven pasted on, without my entertain-
V
ing an idea of the marks of friendship which Mrs. Croshy intended I should receive from her. On the fourth morning a footman brought a letter diredted to me, but went away without waiting for an anSwer. On examining the contents, I found it came from Sir George, with a formal pro-poSal of a Settlement, and inclofing a ISO. Bank-note, which he defired me to accept, declaring that I was
welcome
i
OF FORTITUDE. 101
welcome to it without any condition.
I
—I called up MiSs Croshy, told her oS the billet and its contents, and begged either She or her mother, who was then abroad, would convey my negative to the Baronet in civil terms, and return him his pecuniary favour. She replied,	that Jhe would not do
any Such thing, and she was’affured
/
“ her mother would not; that I “ might deliver my refufal mySelf, when next I Saw Sir George, if I ** continued in that mind; and as “ to the favour I mentioned, I must “ be very imprudent indeed if I did not keep that, to anfwer my ne~ “ ceffities.’'—She then went hastily out of the room, observing, ** that “ there was a great fufs made by
Some
x\j	xxxjc/	ivx r n o
Some people about virtue and mo-
s»
desty, who, perhaps, might be no more virtuous nor nice than other folks, if they were really put ‘‘ to the trial.” I afterwards made my application to Mrs. Croshy, at her return.—She alfo gave me a re-fuSal, though couched in milder terms, and checked her daughter when fire began to Sneer at me as before.—As to my good landlady ^ Speech, the purport of it was—“That “ She was Sorry if Sir George had “ affronted^ when he only meant to “ ferve me.—What I mentioned was “ a matter She did not chuSe to
“ meddle in, at least in that way;
/
“ but if I was determined to refufe “ the Baronet’s propofals, who, as
She
f
OF FORTITUDE. IO3
she knew by what his Servant Said, “ was just then gone a little way out of town, I should have an oppor-“ tunity of feeing and telling him
#
So myfelf within a day or two; and the denial would oome better “ from me, fince it must be So, than ** from any third perfon whatever.''
%
The condefcenfion to argue a cir-
m
cumstance of this fort, the bare fup-pofition that I could confent, were matters at which strict delicacy ought to be offended; but prudence Suggested to me that in my prefent fitua-tion, thefe things ought rather, to work filently as stimulators to urge my quitting fuch an habitation.
I had looked out for lodgings; but as yet had found none to Suit me;
and
104 the triumphs
and I now first began to be appre-* henfive that a charaDer from Mrs. Croshy would be a very Slight recommendation of me to any reputa-table houfe. This reflexion increaSed my anxiety — Good Heavens ! to what perplexities is a young female driven, who stands like me, alone and unfriended in the wide world.— To this I owe that I am in my present fituation :—But to proceed.
The next day I again went out in Search of an apartment, and actually found the difficulty I apprehended; for, after agreeing for a Suitable one,. “ the mistreSs of the houfe demanding to know my last place of abode, having mentioned Mrs. Croshy’s, I
perceived
V
t
\
OF FORTITUDE. 165
perceived that fhe started Several difficulties, and I was disappointed of my lodging.
When I came home, full of vexation, I found Mrs. Croshy and her daughter in high Spirits—They had a young gentleman with them, whom they reported to be her coufin’s Sweetheart : They were all enjoying them-Selves over a bowl of punch; and were very Solicitous with me to partake of the liquor; but finding all their intreaties vain, Mrs. Croshy confined herfelf -only to urging me to drink coffee with them. I fuf-Sered myfelf at last to be prevailed on So far by their intreaties, in which the young gentleman joined, who
Seemed ,
100 THE TRIUMPHS
Seemed, by his conversation, to be a perSon of SenSe, and fit for better company. He appeared very attentive to me; and by that attention, as I thought, difpleafed Mrs. Croshy and her daughter. He went away very early, having Some bulineSs in the city, but promifed to call again in the evening, to fee the young lady at an hour not very proper for viSits of Such a kind to fingle women, who ^^^have a character to loSe.
I withdrew Soon after, and retiring to my chamber in a state of mind which was very diSagreeable. I meant to go early to rest, and to pafs the intervening period of time in reading. Accordingly I went to a
clofet,

in a corner.—I Shrieked: He came Sorward and bade me be pacified, crying, “ It is I! the man of all “ the world that adores you.” It was Sir George; ‘‘ BaSe as you are,

of feveral perSons in the street, en-

quiring what was the matter; immediately on which, Mrs. Croshy, her daughter, and her coufin, came
up, and Soon after, fome of the neigh-

IN CONTINUATION.
I
TN the midst of the confufion occa-stoned by this affair, which ! aS-Sure you. Madam, had almost deprived me oS my faculties, by the time my exertions Subfided, the youth who had been announced as the lover of Mrs. Croshy’s coufin, entered the
room. When the eclairciffment I
■ •
have Spoken of, took place, he ex-
H 2	claimed.
17^ THE TRIUMPHS
claimed, ** What a Scene of villainy is this,” and going up to the Baronet, told him, it was his age only that protected him from an immediate chastisement, But,” added he, “ I hope and believe there are ** ways left, for this injured Innocent to puniSh, or compel you to Some
t
‘‘ recompence. It is clear this was intended only as a piece of revenge for having flighted you and your “ offers. Are you not aShamed of “ fuch behaviour ? But get hence, “ and refledl at home, with what fa-“ tisfaction you can, upon the injury ** you meant to do a defenceleSs fe-male. Your stay here must be Shameful to yourSelf, as the fight

** oS you is hateful to all worthy “ perfons preSent.’"
Covered as he was with confufion, the Baronet needed no Second admonition to be gone. He went off, not without the hisses of most preSent, yet Seemingly Satisfied in Some mea-
%
Sure at having regained his ^50 note,
which, contrary to the perSuafion of
the neighbours, I restored him.
The young gentleman failed not
to upbraid Mrs. Croshy for the part
that I truly declared She had borne in
• ^
this wicked plot, and exhorted me to quit the lodging dire(5l:ly. She replied, I might pay her for what I owed her for board and lodging, and go as Soon as I pleafed, as She did not want my company, to breed disturb-

174 the triumphs

ances in her houSe.—When I afkcd,
I
what I owed her, I found She had run the demand up to a confiderable Sum; for this good woman had charged me for my diet ever Since I had been under her roof, though I never partook of a meal with her, without paying diredfly, except three or four times on her invitation. Yet when I difputed this, She had her daughter and the Servant ready
to confirm what she asserted; and as
»
I had reafon to think they would have done the fame in a Court of
j
Justice, (Such v/as their apparent effrontery) I complied with the demand, having recovered Spirits
enough to tell Mrs. Croshy, that the
\
overcharge I looked on, as a tribute
which I
/
OF FORTITUDE.
t
which I gladly paid, to get rid of all connexions with Such an infamous
perfon.
, That is well judged,” Said the young gentleman, ** and permit me, “ Madam, to lead you out of this ** den of iniquity. I will eScort you “ whither you pleaSe, in fafety.” Thus Situate, I Suffered him to lead me out of the houSe, happy to turn my back of it, after receiving my landlady's promiSe that I should have what things I left there, on Sending for them the next morning.
It was now past ten o'clock; and on my conduDor's afkihg me to what place I choSe to repair, J was confounded, and could only make
the late hour an excuSe for my not
H 4	knowing
lyo THE TRIUMPHS
knowing whom I Should trouble on the occafion.
ft
At the Same time I could not be very eaSy dn this Situation, when I confidered mySelf alone, at Such a time, with a stranger, who might only have taken my part against Mrs. Croshy and the Baronet, with
a view to draw me into another
%
Snare; yet there was Something So open in his behaviour. So tender in
his manner; and he shewed So much readineSs in accompanying me to any Sriend, if I had Such to sty to for shelter, that it Seemed ungenerous to SuSpedl him.
He now propofed conducting me to the houfe of an acquaintance of
his, ‘‘ She is a Captain’s widow,”
Said
>
/
OF FORTITUDE. I77
Said he, a woman of good reputation ; but for that you need not
barely rely upon my word, as you may enquire her charadter in the neighbourhood.’’ I could not well do otherwise than accept this offer, and when we arrived at the-place he mentioned, I found myfelf well received, notwithstanding the extraordinary circumstances attending my introdudtion.
The charadter of Mrs. Sibley anf-wered to what this gentleman had told me. His name is Euston; he is a perSon of fome fortune, and greater dependance. Since I have been here, he has treated me in the most reSpedlful manner, never intruding himfelf but when he is aS-
H 5	fared
I JO	1 U L. 1 K i U M r ii b
fured he is welcome; nor enquiring farther particulars relative to me, than I chuSe to make him acquainted with.
Mr. Euston’s vifits, however, are pretty regular; yet, as he has never declared himfelf a lover on honourable terms, foj on the other hand, he
has never shewn, either bv his words
%
or adfions, that he has any other de-figns. In the mean time he in fists on loading me with prefents, and infists I should not earn my Sub-fistanee in the mode I had before adopted, which, he fays, would be likely to lay me open to many temp-, tations. The step that I took of first throv/ing miyfelf under the pro-tection of this young gentleman,
whom
/
i
ft
OF FORTITUDE. I79
whom chance put in my way, I may well justify by necessity; yet,
perhaps, the propriety of my continuing thus under perpetual obligations to one to whom I cannot tell
/
how to make any return, will not admit of being confidered in the fame point of view. All I can learn from Mrs. Sibley is, that Mr. Euston never
fpeaks of me but with the highest
%
regard, and that he feems rather jealous of my feeing any other com-pany.
I find his acquaintance at Mrs. Croshy’s was flight indeed: having only followed her coufin home from the play the night before I fiw him ; her forwardnefs gave occafion to the vifits I mentioned, at the latter of
II 6	v/hicli.
lOU T li I R 1 U M F H S
which, he Saw enough to diSgust him with the family.
If ever I have any friends, it generally happens that they are at a distance when I most need them. Your preSence in Town, my dear Madam, might have put my affairs
*
into another train. But now it only remains for me to afk your friendly advice how I Shall model my conduct
at Such a juncture.?—At the fame
/
time it may be neceffary to mention, that with refpect to the fituation of my own mind, I have conceived a Sort of grateful esteem for this my
I
benefactor; but, if I know my own heart, it is not tinctured with paf-lion ; So that I am not in any danger of being held in thraldom by him
who
I

OF FORTITUDE. l8l
who appears to pay me So much attention; neither, iShe were to form any dishonourable defigns, would he have the chance of being feconded by my weaknefs, which I believe is too often the cafe with our fex.
Thus, Madam, have I laid my state before you, difguiSing nothing, and inclofe you my addrefs, in hopes
of receiving at least the conSolation of your correfpondence, at a time when your counfel is fo necefiary to

The rest is pretty much at our own option; and if men will be uxo- -rious, the fault is their own;—it is one, that I trust I Shall never stand charged with. In the mean

MISS ELIZA ELLIS TO MISS CAROLINE

T DO not forget you, my Dear;
and I would not have you forget yourfelf in any emergency.
The commands of your parents feem, to me, as unreasonable as their determination; and the pro-

stands to a Peerage, and that he is posteffed of a confiderable fortune ? I hope thefe are not the only qualifications necestary for
him who is to be the hushand of

their daughter and my friend!— Befides he may poffefs Some bad qualities of which they are ignorant. Surely this is a most preci-pitate meaSure of their’s; and Such
as it is not reaSonable to expedl

you should be as precipitate in adopting.
Without advifing you, my Ca-roline, to adt just as I should do,, on this occaSion, I think I need not heSitate to declare my opinion
f
that
i
\
I
OF FORTITUDE. 209
that you are justified in demurring	-
on a matter concluded So hastily. Apply, in particalar, to your mother, who is certainly a woman of good SenSe, and capable of hearing reasonable arguments : As you are So well convinced of her affection, endeavour to awaken her parental feelings; and Spare not to tell her how miferable this intended match must make you;—and miserable you will be, for another reaSon than any you have choSen to infist on.

It is not for nothing that my friend has conceived a diSrelisti for

pleafure; that mirth has lost its charms for her, and that stie retires to Solitude, when stie might

be diSpoSed towards Mr. Bafil, he
had made no advances to you» Surely you could not Suppofe I would recommend you to make any to him:—And you obferved, that the fituation of his affairs
Seemed Such as afforded no room to entertain the Softer passion but the Heart is a very roomy manfion; and perhaps it is never more calculated to receive Such a tender impression than when it has been already Softened by affliction. Nor can I believe, the perfon in question is So buSy as not to be at leifure to love: I am rather of opinion, that he is not inSen-

fible to the charms of my friend, though he may wait a favourable moment for declaring his Sentiments. I must fay, for my own part, it is my opinion, he is the only man you have yet beheld, that can make you happy in the marriage state.—That he viewed
you with eyes of tenderneSs, when
%
first he Saw you at B------; and, I
believe, yoUy Caroline, were of the fame opinion. I would, therefore, have you, on all accounts, be steady in refufing to listen to the propoSed lover, who thinks he has made his approaches So regular. By this time, however, I may reasonably fuppofe he has thought
proper to addreSs you in perfon,

that I Should neither give him a meeting nor an anSwer, till I had the pleafure of knowing to whom

So, you fee, ray Dear, that, contrary to the common mode, I am prac-

OUR Sudden departure, in the midst of the festivity here, my dear and reSpected friend, really cast a damp upon the Spirits of most of the company, and are much regretted by the noble Owner of the manfion. With regard to mySelf, it has left nle almost alone, in leaving me without my introducer.—

form an argument against it. For what have I to boast, that in the eyes of the world you Set me on a footing with Lord Mountford, even though my own partiality should lead me to give mySelf the preference: and further, should I contend, and carry off the prize from my rival, am I not doing an injury to the perSon I love, at least will not the world, whofe cenfure I have So often experienced, judge and decide in this manner. Nay, what is more, may not the objedt of my love herSelf, on cool refiedlion, in after times, be ready to accuSe me of a felfishneSs, which induced me to perSuade her to forego her honour and advantage, in order

to gratify my wishes ? It is not
common, you will fay, for lovers to

reafon thus; nor could I, were I once to pay addreffes to my fair one, to find them favoured by her, and
to indulge what would become a mutual passion. What better then can I do, but at once jtjcr prevent, to stifle, if possible, an inclination which is likely to meet with fo many obstacles ? If fate indeed should hereafter fmile upon me, and Caroline should remain diSengaged, I might then, with confidence, declare an honourable love, and expedt an honourable reception.
To you, my best of friends, I have thus unboSomed myfelf, as I
have

have not a Sentiment that I defire to conceal from you, nor a circumstance in my life that I could wilh you to be unacquainted with.

The cha-radler of Lord Bromley is indeed, of itSelf Sufficient to make every one regard him; nor can I wonder at the haste with • which you stew to him on receiving the news of his ill-neSs, which I regret, your abfence as well as the occafion.

S24 THE TRIUMPHS
MiSs Caroline Stanmore is now openly addressed by a lover—not by Charles Bafil—not by Lord MelSord —but by Mr. Holton, an honourable gentleman, with whom I believe you are not entirely unacquainted.
His Suit, as far as I can learn, is countenanced by her parents, and he has begun to carry it on with Such boldneSs as if he had hardly a doubt oS SucceSs j though it does not ap-■■ pear that the lady herSelf is very par-
tial in his favour.
IP But, whatever are her Sentiments,
I	•*'?'**
IM ' can I wonder at thole which others ' entertain of her charms and accom-
plissiments ? Can I be at all Surprised that Such an accomplished
female
OF FORT ITU D E. 22^
female should find her lovers multiplied Every day she grows higher in my esteem, whilst every day but removes my hopes of posteshng this trcaSure to a greater distance.
You will, perhaps, think it rather
extraordinary, my dear Sriend, that I should not have exprested the Same concern when Lord Melford was first given as a lover to MiSs Stanmore, who was one more worthy than he is who at preSent addrefies her; but you will remember this young nobleman had not declared his love; and that there was a probability of his parents throwing obstacles in his way. On the other hand, Mr. Holton actually proceeds, with the con-
* K 5	Sent
#
226 THE TRIUMPHS
Sent of Mr. Stanmore, under no re* straint from his own relations, and'
(if I rightly read his character) with a head capable of framing a thousand artifices, which, if they fhould not enforce his fuccefs, will at lead give her a chance of throwing any rival at a distance. In the height of affluence and independence, he is otherwise poffefied of a gaiety and Spirit which, in the courfe of frequent conversation, may recommend him to thoSe who at first were quite
indifferent to him. The refpect
«.
which I have been told MiSs Stanmore pays to the commands of her parents will operate too in his fa- I

*	the
1
OF FORTITUDE. 22/
the object of my wishes without
9
even an attempt to make them known, being foiled without engaging in the contest.
At the fame time, in order to add to my anxiety, I think there is a perceptible coolneSs in Lord Bellgrove’s behaviour towards me. This is the more extraordinary in the man who fo warmly interested himfelf in my behalf, as we may both well remember, when I first came hither, and
*
who acted in concert with yourSelf in detecting a calumny which otherwise would Soon have Spread abroad like wild-fire, and owed its birth, as I had reaSon to apprehend, to my good-natured brother.
K 6	I affure
220 THE TRIUMPHS
I alTure you, thus fituate, were it not for the charm of Caroline’s prefence, I should be tempted to leave this place, where, in the midst of furrounding pleafures, I can taste no enjoyment, even before the few remaining days allotted to the period of festivity expires. As it is, I conceive I cannot add to, but must rather dimi-— nish from, the mirth of the company, in Spite of all my endeavours to the*
contrary. Forced Smiles are not likely to communicate pleafure, and that joy can be but ill depiisted on the countenance which does not ariSe from the SenSations of the heart.
It may be imagined, after what I
have faid, that I shall stay no longer
than
/

than till the conclufion of our anniversary, notwithstanding a former invitation from his Lordfhip. When Mifs Stanmore departs, every gleam that can brighten this place in my view will be gone.

Bromley-Park, July 2.
'Y' OUR letters, my dear friend,
reached me whilst I was em-employed in attending the bed of ficknefs, and endeavouring, by con-verfation and all pofiible assiduities, to allevate the pains of my worthy kinSman, who has Suffered most Severely from a violent fit of the stone.
It

It is indeed the hard lot of mortals

to Suffer afflictions in this Sublunary state; and, were we to judge only by appearances, we Should conclude alSo that the Sufferings of Some exceeded thoSe of others in an immenfe proportion. But as we cannot decide by externals, only the truth remains enveloped in clouds; and all the afflicted can do is to call fortitude to their aid, as I have always hitherto known you do; and if the afflictions are unmerited, a confcious SenSe of worth will doubtleSs help to Sustain them. All this is but repeating what you know already; but there are Some matters of which Sometimes it may not be amiSs that we Should be reminded.
If

If I blamed you, my dear friend, either for diffidence or Seeming re-
'•V
miffneSs in what concerned you nearest, it was only with the hope of stirring you up to thoSe exertions of which you ire capable. I cannat be infenfible to the difficulties you have to encounter, yet I conceive the fweetneSs of your manners, and the accomplishments which (I may fay without flattery) you poflfeSs, are Such as may win the heart of a female of MiSs Stanmore’s difpolition. Indeed I have thought that lady Sometimes stole Some glances at you, which Seemed to indicate that you were agreeable in her eyes. As to Lord
V
Mountford, his gallantry and general
tender-
V
OP FORTITUDE. 233
tenderneSs to the Sex is Such, that I doubted whether to rank him as a lover of that lady, to whom he pof-fibly fliewed a marked attention, as being under the immediate protection of his parents, who, however, as you Seem yourSelf to be Senfible, would not be likely to approve her for a daughter-in-law. If the Earl of Bellgrove has a foible, it is that of paying rather too much reSpedt to titles and nobility; where he finds them, it is most likely he will Seek
t
family alliances.
Though it is Sudden, and appears a little extraordinary, that HoltaS^n Zo fhould declare himfelf a lover of MiSs Stanmore, and, by a fort of manoeuvre, polTefs himfelf of the conSent of
her
234 THE TRIUMPHS
.
her parents, wha, as I believe, know . but little of him ; yet his rival Ship may not be So dangerous as you imagine. If I have formed a just idea of the perfon he addrestes, his Suit will be disagreeable to her; and perhaps
it may appear that her father and mother were SurpriSed into a confent, and urged to lay commands on their child, which they will not infist on
'I
her implicitly obeying, if they are affured that in So doing they will render her unhappy.
A Short time will probably enable you to form Some judgment of the
i
event; in the meanwhile, I Should j fuppoSe you were better Situate for
1
observing what paSTes at Bellgrove-Place than at London. As to his
Lordship’s
OF FORTITUDE. 235
#
LordShip’s coolneSs, I am really apt to think that exists only in your imagination ; for a man of that open-nefs, which he gave proofs of at your first arrival, would, I think be plain enough to tell you if he had feen or heard any thing to fink you in his opinion. I hope therefore you will, on refiedlion, revoke your refolution of departing at the end of the festival; at least if that worthy nobleman renews his invitation.
I have the happinefs to tell you that my kinfman has greatly recovered. I prefent you with his remembrances, and thofe of lady Mary, and Subscribe myfelf, yours as ever,

It was but yesterday that I received a letter, the first I ever had, and per-haps the last that I stiall ever have from him.

However, he has vanilhed almost as Soon as he appeared in that character; The anniversary was no Sooner ended than a meffage was delivered, which

Bath, July 13.
T NEED not tell you, my Lord, ^ the SenSible pleaSure I received to find you were relieved from thoSe excruciating pains occafioned by your

forming the greatest blesting that mortals can enjoy below.
In the midst of your indiSpofition, my noble friend, it was, at least, your happineSs to receive from a lister and a kinfman that attention which Soothes the languid heart, and contributes to make leSs tedious the diS-confolate hour. The loSs of a beloved wife, and of a child on whom my fond hopes had been placed, were among the afflidlions I experienced before I attained the meridian of life :—At a period wheii the ardent passions of youth Subfide, and gaudy pleaSures begin to fade in our eyes, the dear relation of kindred ties and
family affedions stiould form the
%
greater part of our happinefs.
You

You are well acquainted, my Lord, that I had but one objedt to whom I wished to transfer thefe affedlions —my brother’s Son; a youth of pro-mifing talents, and, as I had reafon to fuppofe, endowed with the feeds of many virtues. I conceived that I stood in the place of a father to him. I believe he loved and refpedted me. It was my endeavour to infpire him with notions of virtue and honour ; and I flatter myfelf he profited by my lessons—which tended to put afide the idea of rigid controul and distance, that is fo apt to render relations or guardians difagreeable in the eyes of young people; and having done fo, I naturally concluded that ,I should have tlie whole of my

of indifference. This he Seems not to regard, as he can form other friendships,' other connexions, and draw from them flattering ideas, v/bich, it is to be feared, time will

never realife. Unfortunately, I doubt for him, he has chofen for a friend and companion a young fellow, of rank and fortune I confefs, but one whofe morals will not bear the test;

but I find, shy his last letter, the

prefent, therefore, I forbear any thing of the fort; indeed I likewife
forbear corresponding with him, though I still watch over him with an anxious eye, for his good, and am better acquainted with the con-. duct he adopts than, I believe, he imagines. In the mean time, if it happens, my Lord, that he should vifit at your houSe, as he has been ■

LORD BROMLEY TO COLONEL MELFORD.
Bromley-Park, July I7,
YOUR congratulations, my worthy and rdfpected Sriend, cannot but be acceptable, as I know they ^^‘'teome from the heart. How many do I
receive that are mere matter of form ? sP Compliments void of fincerity, which
‘ = 5 "I'
can give no Satisfadion to a man of feeling and understanding, and which custom only renders tolerable.
I deemed
(
\
OF F O R T I T U I> E 0	g
I deemed it peculiarly unlucky that my indiSpofition Should occafion my coufin Merton to quit a Scene of innocent recreation to come to the houSe of mourning! As youth is the feafon for pleaSure, So I wifli to fee all young perSons, of either fex, enjoy it, according to their rank and lituation in life, within the bounds of moderation and virtue. It has formed no Small part of my happi-nefs to obServe this young man treading in the paths of redlitude.— Such were the earlier days of my brother. Thus, in the very dawn of youth, did he accustom himfelf to laudable habits, which, daily unfolding themfelves, rendered him the
B 5	delight
lO THE TRIUMPHS
delight of his friends and acquaintance, and promised to make him an ornament to his country.—But our
tears h$ve embalmed his memory !— Let our praiSes be given to thoSe who
copy his virtues I
As to your nephew, my dear Colonel, it is long lince I had the plea-
i
Sure of feeing him. His other con-nexions, doubtleSs, take up too much of his time to allow him for a moment to think of Bromley-Park. I am Sorry they are Such as you do not approve. There is nothing of greater conSequence than the company we make choice of in our early years, as from thence the future complexion of our lives is apt to take
the

the strongest tincture. Though this maxim is not new ^ yet it is one that cannot be too often repeated and inculcated on youth, as So much of their happinefs or infelicity must depend on the observance or neglect of it. But as a good difpofition and a clear understanding appear to be united in Mr. Euston, it is to be
hoped and expected that if he has fallen into any errors, too common at
his time of life, he will fee and amend them before it is too late. There was a time, indeed, when I thought an alliance between our families might have taken place:—I believe that is a matter now not to be expected; but the alliance of

LETTER XXXIV.
MISS ELIZA ELLIS TO MISS CAROLINE
STANMORE.
July iS,
pORTUNE is truly unkind to you, my dear Caroline 1 but you must not, therefore, be unkind to yourSelf. If you cannot have the man of your choice, that is no rea-fon why you should fuster yourSelf to be urged To accept of one with whom you are likely to be unhappy.
You
14 'THE TRIUMPHS
You Seem to think it is vain to expect any thing from your mother’s
t
tenderneSs, Have you forgot at what a distance you are now from her ? When you return home your prefence may do much with her, and perhaps even with Mr. Stan-more; at least you can but make the trial, as there is no caufe for hurrying this intended match, which
A
can, you know, never be brought about, if you act with the reSolution. All the danger is, that from an idea
4
of refpect and dutiful fubmistion, my friend fhould bring upon herSelf “ a world of woe.”
The affair you mention of Mr. BaSil is strange; but the more myf-
terious
OF FORTITUDE.	I5
terlous it Seems, there appears, in my Small judgment, the leSs reaSon for Sufpecting him of any actual or intended evil. A matter of this fup-pofed magnitude ought to be brought forward, that the accuSed may have a chance of clearing himfelf; fo that, whatever may be intended, I fee no friendship evidenced by the concealment.—Whilst a whifper goes round, the good-natured world are always apt to fuppofe the worst that can be
imagined; and when nothing is ab-folutely alledged, there is not room
for contradiction. But, my dear, as you have not forgot that Mr. Bafil has an unnatural brother, and that brother has a mistrefs, whom he is
always
l6 THE TRIUMPHS
always promifing one day to make his wdfe, and who is capable of urging him to any miSchief, theSe circumstances being kept in remembrance, should incline you to think, whatever the allegation may be, that ' this, like the rest, is Something that originates from their machinations
rather than to conclude that your
%
lover is a villain and a hypocrite.
It v/as, however, an unfortunate hour for the young gentleman to avow his paffion; but it was at a
I
time when all his fen fa dons were awake, and he adted accordingly. Alas! Caroline, you knew not the fituation of your own heart till it was thus explored ^ and, it must be
acknow»
OF FORTITUD E. IJ
acknowledged, that you have found it in an inaufpicious SeaSon. But time only, which diScovers all things, can determine whether you ought to be Sorry or rejoice for the impression the Soft passion has made in your bofom.
As for my lover, he has advanced a step or two farther; he has assfured me, by one of Cupid’s messengers, in the ufual way, that if I listen from him I fhall have nothing to fear (he does not mean to raviSh or carry me off, like a difcourteous knight); and he acquaints me that his name is Sandby—repeating what he Set out with aster ting, and what it would be an affront to myfelf not to
premife.

premise, That his defigns are honourable.’’ We have not yet had an interview, but I know not how Soon we may, when certain preliminaries are Settled. I would fain have had him unfold his pretenfions at once to my uncle; Since, according to the account he gives of himfelf, the old gentleman could have no plaufible objection to his addrefiing me, unleSs he means to condemn me to a Single
■
bssa Slate, or retain me to attend on him
during his natural life.—I trust he will not be fo unreasonable. But this matter will furhiSh us with a topic of diScourSe, if we Should meet. In the mean time, my dear, I am really anxious about your Situation,
and

London, July lo.
J Perceive, dear Jack, that there is a neceffity for me at preshnt to determine decisively on the line of conduct I am in future to purfue— whether it is to be that formally prescribed by grave books, and inculcated by careful relations, or that which we are apt to conceive more
liberal,
f

liberal, as being under leSs controul
from our own doubts or fears, or the opinions of others. By endeavouring to strike out a middle path between thefe feeming extremes, it appears that I have begun to wander in a fort of maze, from which it is proper that I Should think betimes of extricating mySelf. There have been fome fituations, wherein, if I had followed the one mode, I Should have gone farther ; whilst, according to the other, perhaps I Should not have gone So far. It is plain, that I must refolve either to fubjedl: mySelf to thoSe rules and restridlions which are dignified with lofty founding names, and are connected with the
belief

belief of Systems, the necestity of which I begin to doubt, or I must determine to think freely for my-felf, which leads to a confequent freedom of adlion. You will wonder that I even hefitate to chufe the latter; but you ought to allow for
the prejudices of education, and that regard for the opinions of the world which is So apt to tindfure our manners. The epithets of Atheist and Libertine, So commonly bestowed on thoSe who shake off the shackles put upon them by custom, are disagreeable to hear; and to avoid them is, perhaps, the chief motive that urges many to act upon Such prin-ciples as induce them to many acts of Self-denial,

OP FORTITUDE. 23
I am led into theSe reflections partly by the tenor of your last letter, and partly by Some conversation I had
with Lord Bromley, whom I vifited
/
the other day. I found his Lord-Ship recently recovered from a fit of the stone. Sicknefs, we know, makes most men thoughtful, and when they are declining in the vale of years, adds to the gravity of their difpofl-tion. This worthy Baron is a man whom my uncle always taught me to reSpect. He has a niece, for whom I once entertained fomething of a childish passion; on which circumstance, I believe, the Colonel formed expectations of making an alliance
with that family^ But that impreS-
fion
«
24 THE TRIUMPHS
fion is worn off, and I cannot Say I have ever been urged about the matter ; perhaps the young lady has got another Sweetheart; at least her family and fortune are fuch as may enfure her the most flattering offers, to fay nothing of her perfon and accomplishments, which most people
will think worthy of notice.
But, to return from this digref-fion;—I found Lord Bromley rather . difpofed to chide me, though in his uSual mild way, for paying, of late, fo little attention to my old friend. After he had made feveral observations on the imprudent and thought-lefs condudl of youth, which I took - as fide-wind reflections on my own,
I brought
V
O F F O R T I T 0 D E. 25
I brought his Lordship nearer to the point, by inquiring after my uncle’s health. He then ventured to {peak more plainly; and, arraigning my behaviour to him, obServed, that no connexions I could form (even were
they to appear ever So valuable)
%
ought to be put in competition with . the Coioners friendship. I anSwer-ed, by admitting this; but begged leave to remark that my good relation had alSo his arcana^ and Some -of the greatest confequence, as he has Said; which, though they con-

for communication. I urged, that I might plead a fimilar excuSe, and Said, that as I had last written to my uncle, in a reSpedlful manner, the flight lay on his fide rather than on mine.
The Peer Seemed Surprised at Such a mode of defence—I guested it would Surprise him ; and I had made uSe of it, as Some learned counSel do in their way, to perplex the cauSe; this being estedfed, I turned the diS-courSe, and the difagreeable Subjedt was renewed no more during my stay at Bromley-Paik, which I made as short as postible.
From what has pasted, you will SuppoSe it likely that I have broke

with my uncle; and you know that for the preSent I have lost my miS-treSsit is my conSolation that I retain my friend ;—it is my happi-nefs that I am. not offended at liis apparent cenSures.
Amelia’s Sudden retreat could not but excite vexation. However, the first gust of paffion being over, I had leisure to form my refolution, which is, to purSue the jilt, if Such She be, and to gratify my defires in one way, if I cannot come up to the extent of my wishes in another.

r is still my lot, my valued friend, to be a complainant. Fortune yet ^ delights in persecuting me; I find continually new Sources of unhappi-neSs.
The coolneSs of Lord Bellgrove was not imaginary ; it increaSed during the short remainder of the fef-tival; at the conclufion of which, a letter was delivered to me, by one of the performers, that at once put an

end to the debate I had been holding with mySelf, whether I Should prepare for my departure, or remain on the Spot, in preference of the former invitation.
To what I am to attribute the loSs of his lordShip^s friendship, and the

intimation of a charge not fpecifi-
\
cally brought forward, I know not, except to Some new machinations of Sir Frederic. Painful ideal—that whenever I dread or experience any mifchief, I must first examine whether it does not originate with my own brother! Yet my reaSons for this are So well known to you, that they need not here be repeated.

As to what I owe mySelf in this particular, or what I owe the objedt

I
out against the Solicitations of one not Suited to her temper, and an union with whom, there is reaSon to think, may make her unhappy.
For my own part, I have thought of quitting (I will not fay forever, but for a SeaSoii) the place of my birth, which has hitherto been to me the land of misfortune; there is a chain of caufes, which being once broken, the affairs of life may take a different turn. Who knows but

kind at this time may have that ef-fe£t. It is no more than I have thought on at an earlier period; perhaps the time is now ripe for the execution. Amongst other circumstances, it can hardly be doubted but my leaving England will prove matter of fatisfaction to a brother, who feems impatient of my existing in our common native land.
I will not aSk you, my Dear Sir, to protedt my charadlcr against thoSe who may affume a double privilege of inSulting me from my abSence.

VOUR letter, my dear Amelia, I cannot but be inclined to rank among thoSe productions of the pen which prove, while we write them, that we are either unacquainted with the feelings of our own hearts, or wish to render thoSe fo to whom we addrefs ourSelves.
When I recommended to you to receive the addreffes of Mr. Aileshy,
whilst

42 THE TRIUMPHS
whilst I attempted to introduce a new lover, I wished likewiSe to make a trial whether you had shaken off the partiality you Seemed to entertain “ for the man whom you had begun to esteem.” If I gueSs aright, according to the ufual mode, of judging in fuch affairs, you have not yet gained that victory over a growing inclination; till you have, perhaps the introduction of a new object may not be fo proper. I am not over fond of chufing for people in matters of this nature; and I heartily wish you had been enabled to make a good choice for yourfelf. Your fituation has been Somewhat peculiar indeed; but as to
the
«
OF FORTITUDE. 43
the article relative to your birth, you dwell too much upon that. In the opinion oS a true lover. Such an ingenious confefiion, as you mention, would have charms Sufficient to overbalance the SuppoSed defedt, in which there can exist no moral turpitude, nor any real inconvenience; and as to the other part of the objection, I trust we have worthy persons, of different ages and defcrip-
I
tions, who would regard that as they would the want of fortune, merely as a trifle, when weighed against vir-^ tue and proper accomplishments.
Thus I have conSidered the matter as you defired, and here you have the reSuIt. Far from leading you
into
f
44 the triumphs
into errors or embarraffments, it has been my wish and endeavour to pre-— vent you falling into any; I only propoSed what I thought would be for your advantage, and shall urge k no farther than by telling you, once for all, that Mr. Aileshy is a joung gentleman of Some fortune; that he poffcffes at once a great good temper and a Solid understanding, averSe to the general distipation of the times, and having Seen you while unSeen, has taken a liking to your perfon, which is heightened by what he has heard of your charadler. I fee no reaSon to believe that his relations will have any objedlion to his ad-drefiing you, So that the whole will
lie
OF FORTITUDE. 45
lie within your own breast to determine. Your preSent unproteded fituation expofing you to many inconveniences, is the reaSon why I would have you accept of an advantageous offer to change your condition ; as to See you in a more eligible fituation is the earnest wiSh of.

LORD MOUNTFORD TO GEORGI AILES-
BY, ES(1.
A FTER So long an abSence from 1
the friend of my earlier years, I it was an untoward circumstance to [ be obliged to content myfelf with a [ converfation of a few hours with I him on my arrival in England. But I this duty and my promife demanded, I and I complied accordingly.	|
We mould have been happy in your prefence at the anniverfary. It
is
I
OF FORTITUDE. 47
is a family institution, which Some will deem an idle pageant, but yet, as managed by my father, candour
must allow that Some good reSults
%
from it, as it furnifhes employment for many, exhibits a Scene of Eng-listi hoSpitality, and contributes to keep mirth and good humour alive among the circle of his acquaintance.
Yet here, as at all fimilar astern-
\
blies, it will Sometimes happen that circumstances may occur rather of a diSpleafing nature; in which cafe, all that can be done is to take every meaSure. to prevent, as much as poS-Sible, their breaking in on the ge-neral harmony.
The
\
48 THE TRIUMPHS
The benevolent temper of Lord Bellgrove is continually prompting him to do all that lies in his power to countenance virtue in distrefs, and to Supply what fortune or destiny Seem to have denied; probably (to quote his own maxim) one that thoSe who are blest with rank and wealth may have an opportunity of Shewing whether they deferve thofe gifts, and the consequent influence they im-
i
part, by employing them for the'benefit of the unhappy
Mr, Merton, a kinfman of Lord Bromley’s, of whom you have heard, was So warm in the praifes of a Mr,
Bafil, brother to the Baronet of that

name, as to induce my mother to

give him an invitation to Bellgrove-Place, where they both arrived during the time of the festival. This Mr. Bafil is Said to be perfecuted by his brother, at the instigation of a favourite mistrefs. Indeed our stranger guest was no Sooner arrived than it was thought necestary to clear up Some ill reports Spread of him, which were fuppofed to originate from that quarter. This being done, he was received with unfeigned pleaSure;
/
and, notwithstanding an apparent diS-pofition to be Serious, yet he had the power of affuming Such a fweetnefs of manners, and is really postested of So many genteel accomplishments, as recommended him highly to the VoL. II. D	com-f

company; nor was I backward in displaying the esteem I entertained of
(
this young man, becauSe I really thought he deServed it.
• /
Previous to his arrival here, we were favoured with the company of MiSs Caroline Stanmore. This young lady derives no lustre from her rank
~ or fortune, but claims refpetSl: from
\
her beauty and merit, which are Such as cannot paSs unnoticed. I own they
attradled my regard as Soon as I beheld, and had the pleafure of feeing and coriverfing with her. As she
came hither unaccompanied, by fpe-
\
cial invitation, and was under the immediate protection of my parents, the attention I paid this young beauty
was
i
OF FORTITUDE. £l
was the more conSistent with propriety, and the lefs obServed by the eyes of most who Surrounded us. But,
---^uis faltere pojjit amantem F
there were thoSe who remarked this, and, as ft appears, penetrated my thoughts, I will not Say my defigns, for I had formed none, but was led,
I know not whither, by a fort of Sweet delufion.
There were two of our guests who Set me down for a dangerous rival; the one was Mr. Holton, a young gentleman of rank and independence; the
other, to my SurpriSe, this Mr. Bafil,
*
who, with all the appearance of open-nefs, knows how to veil his defigns in
%
the moft artful manner imaginable.
D 2	The
52 THi^TRIUMPHS
The former has openly profclTed himfelf the lady’s lover, after having made an application to her parents, in which he Succeeded to his wishes; the latter formed private Schemes, in which they were never meant to be consulted. We found that he had laid a plan, in concert with Some of his former companions, to carry off MiSs Stanmore, whether with her own conSent we know not, but from her character and condudl towards him, we judge the contrary. In the execution, the rules of hoSpitality were in more reSpedts than one to be violated; and, on the pretence of my being likely to prove the greatest obstacle to his wishes, my Sentence was
the
•	s
/
OF FORTITUDE. 53
s
the Severest. I fhall not trouble you, my dear friend, with farther particulars of this rasti and wicked plot, of which it was my counfel to wait the iffue thus warned; but Lord Bell-grove would not admit the thought of fuch a fcene of confufion. My next defign was to offer fingle combat to Balil; but that was over-ruled by the confideration that a man who would play the ruffian did not deServe to be encountered as a gentleman. The idea of bringing this intended mifchief to a proof, and fixing the accufation on the party, was repressed, on account of the public talk it would occafion, and the injury the lady’s charadler might fuffer undefcrvedly, if, as it was prefumed,
D 3	she

54 THE TRIUMPHS
She was innocent of the matter. It was determined, therefore, only to cauSe a letter to be delivered, intimating that his bufineSs was discovered, exhorting him to tread in other paths, and defiring his abSence from a place where he had meditated f® much mifchief. This extraordinary man complied, but not till he had fought for my father and mySelf, who were purpoSely gone abroad, in order to avoid altercation on a fub-jcdl: which might have carried us beyond due bounds, just at the conclusion of a Scene of chea'rfulneSs, and festivity.
Thus one rival is removed; for Such I cannot but esteem him. In the meantime, Mr. Holton still remains,
OF FORTITUDE. 55
mains, and plies the lady with unwearied assiduity. For my own part, confidering the difficulties before me,
I know not with what propriety I
\
can appear in the charadler of a lover. Holton is perpetually before her, and has the Sandlion of her parents; or if she really regarded BaSil, his image is likely to be still in her heart. For myfelf, I am fenSible She never ffiewed the least figns of partiality ; if She had, my Situation would have enabled me to discover and improve: them. BeSides all this, I can have no defigns but Such as are honourable ; and I have not a hope of ever ■ gaining the content of Lord and Lady Bellgrovc to a match of this
D 4	nature^
\
ft
56 THE TRIUMPHS
nature. To adl in contradidlion to them would create family diSputes; and you know my diSpofitipn So well as to conclude that circumstance would take much from my felicity.
Though, from the diScovery I have mentioned, it was So evident that Balil meant to treat me as a rival, yet my parents never choSe to take notice of this, but rather to understand that he confidered me as the lady’s protedlor, becaufe fhe was under our roof, which was a wilful misunderstanding, adopted, apparently on pur-
i
poSe, to avoid all investigation of the Subject.
This bufineSs has difcompofed the Bari, whilst I begin to feel mySelf the
more

more anxious, as I conceive the probability of enjoying the object of my wishes to be farther removed. Sometimes I wish I had avowed my inclinations as foon as they had birth; then again I check that reflection, for thofe reafons which I have just now assigned. Thefe fluctuations, I fear, are figns of a pashon, which, could a lover confult prudence, she would
bid him by all means diScourage.

T WAS Galled away in haste, which was the Gccafion of leaving my letter of yesterday unfinistied. In addition, I have to tell you that Mifs Stanmore fet out this day from Bell-grove-Place, in eonfequence of a letter from home, commanding her immediate prefence. Though her father is only a private gentleman, of very stender fortune, as I am informed,

ducts him Self as if he had Scarcely a doubt of fucceSs; but then it must be remembered that he is of an aS-fuming difpofitxon, and in ev^ery fitu-ation of life is calculated to act haughtily. Whether he thought of Bafil as a rival, I cannot tell; but if he did, it Seems pretty plain that he feared him not, but was rather inclined to deSpiSe him. While the former was planning his manner of
addreSs to Mifs Caroline Stan more, he Seems to have been courted by Lady Juletta Sabine, whofe temper, volatile to every one befides. Seemed capable of being fixed by him alone. But from the first he flighted her ad^ vances, and (he appears to have been

eagle-eyed in diScerning that he had Some other attachment. Her ladyship afterwards appeared inclined to make a conquest of me; but if she was Serious in this, she met with a ferious disappointment.

TheSe must be the refult of mutual love. When shall I be blest in fuch an enjoyment ?

J T was a mutual unhappineSs, my dear Lord, that we were confined, on your arrival, to So short an interview. It is to be hoped that our next will, in that reSpect, be more conformable to our wishes. In the meantime, we cannot be cut from the privileges -and partial enjoyment of friendship, while we thus communicate our thoughts to each other.

Yet, I think, as affairs are now fituate, if you could Surmount the obstacle you expect to meet with

JOHN SEYWARD TO SIR FREDERIC BASIL.
• «
I
Honoured Sir,	Auguft i.
YOUR brother is gone from Bell-grove-Place ; he staid no longer
till just as the feasting was over. During his stay, I got acquainted with David, a fervant of his, a Welchman, and endeavoured, by means of that man, to make out what I could concerning his master. He faid, he was greatly refpedled by my Lord Sor his goodneSs, and becaufe it was
fuppoSed
*
yo THE TRIUMPHS
SuppoSed he was uSed cruelly by his nearest relation, I SuppoSe meaning your honour. As I pretended to be ignorant oS all concerning Such things, and gave in to whatever David Said, when he praiSed his master, wishing I was in Service mySelf, So I could but get one as good, therefore he trusted me innocently with all he knew j and Mr. Charles, as I find, did not take much care about hiding any thing from him. Now your honour is to understand that David has been at Sea, and he can read and write pretty well, which, very likely, your brother does not know. How-foever that is, he Saw Some copies of letters to Mr. Merton, and by theSe
he
OF FORTITUDE. 7I
he found out that Mr* Bafil was in love with MiSs Caroline Stanmore, a young lady of no great fortune, but who has expedlations of a deal at the death of a relation. The Earl’s fon, just arrived from his travels, feemed to have a kindnefs for her likewiSe ; and Mr. Holton, whom I believe your honour has Seen, made love to this young lady publicly.
While I was studying how I might
I
make Some handle of what David had been So ignorant as to tell me, I found things were taking a Surprifing turn. Among the vifitors at Bell-grove-Place was a Lady Juletta Sabine, a lovely widow, who, attacking different perSons in her coquettish
THE TRIUMPHS
tifh way, found MiSs Stanmore preferred by almost all of them; and '
particularly by my young Lord and Mr. Holton, of whom She had
thought to make a conquest. Whether fhe had intelligence, or whether women See into matters of intrigue more deeply than men, it is not for me to judge, but She was either aS-fured, or strongly fancied, that Mr, Charles Bafil was Smitten with MiSs Caroline. On this, I Suppofe, she built a defign of making it fuppofed , that her rival’s stay at Bellgrove-Place was dangerous, and wished it to be understood that your brother would raiSe a disturbance there, on her account, with Lord Mountford.
I was
O^F F O R T I T U 'D 'E.	73

I was introduced to this lady, by means of her Servant, and found that she was just in the cue for a matter of this fort. She entered freely into difcourSe with me, and told me she wished it to be understood that Mr, Bafil had laid a plot to carry off Mifs Stanmore as Soon as the festivity at Bellgrove-Place was ended.
Being thus intrusted to form the plan, which was intended for tshe difgrace of Mifs Stanmore, I thought it would be eafy to turn the great hinge of the bufineSs against Mr. Bafil, whereby he would -at least lofe, all his credit, and be forced to leave this place of feasting in a manner very different from that in which he
Vox. II.	T	came
I

t
came there. As what we intended before had not anSwered any purpofe,
I thought this was all that was leSt for me to do in your Honour’s behalf; and I believe. Sir Frederic, you will own I made the best uSe of
my naaterials, when I went to work upon them.
Without inquiring what reaSon her
■
ladySbip had to be fo fure of your brother’s defigns, as I had defired
[
her to leave all to my management, Hammond and Sykes being luckily with me, knowing them devoted to your Service, we framed a plan, on the ground of Lady Juletta’s, with proper alterations, and a letter was lent by thefe, under feigned names,

_ •
at the Sametime to Secure Mr. Holton and Lord Mountford, and to proceed to the most violent meaSures with my Lord if he made any refist-ance. TheSe particulars Hammond and Sykes declared in the letter they were willing to Swear to.
To strengthen this evidence, which you will think, Sir, I did not mean there Should be occafion to produce, for good reafons, I reSolved to go to Bellgrove mySelf; and as I had heard the Earl was eaSy to be Spoke with, inquired for him, and got to talk to

’yHE breach between Charles and the Bellgrove family is just as I would have wished; though it has happened in a manner that I could not expedt, I can Sec no good rea-fon for doubting that the ground work of the whole, as Lady Juletta told you, might be true; for, with all his Seeming tranquility of temper, Charles is very enterprizing, and of

Thia-is the last reSource of his extravagance ; So it behoves him to make the most of it, which yet, I rest af-Sured, he will not do—for if any idle whimfy falls in his way, that he can dignify with the name of generofity, he will prefently sting away his coin, fo fond is he of being be-praifed; and yet you find he manages matters fo badly, that little praife falls to his-Share; but he fuffers for his own follies ; and, like the Quakers, calls thoSe Sufferings perfecution. - Such is

I perceived I was to be founded on this occafion : whatever it was, my innocence must be evinced by my ig*. norance, which his Lordship did not chufe to enlighten.—As I was not perfedlly fatisfied with this condudt, we parted, with a, coolnefs which I was forry for, and which would not at all contribute to restore the tranquility of my mind, that had been So recently disturbed at the clofe of a Scene of pleafure.
At home I find mySelf lefs at eafe,

than might be wished or expected. My Father Seems to regard me rather
with

with the watchSul eye of a governor, than the tender affedlion oS a parent; and my mother cannot shew her wonted tenderneSs, becauSe she makes a point of copying him in every thing. In the meantime, I hear nothing but the commendations of Mr. Holton, with whofe prefence, however, we have not been honoured here, though he left Bellgrove-Place, as I conceive, with that intention-^ But, I believe, he has been defired to withhold his vifits, till the event of my aunt’s illnefs is finally determined ; this is, indeed, a relpite for me; I am Sorry the cauSe should be of So melancholy a nature.
It has been reported that Mr. BaSil is adlually preparing to go abroad; this

Place; and what could he undertake for. me, to bring him into diSgrace there, whether merited or unmerited, and render it a matter eligible or ne-ceffary for him, at this juncsture, to quit England ?
I think I am reSolved, at any rate^ not to Sacrifice my happineSs, by becoming the wife of Holten; at the Same time, you will obServe,. in my fituation, whilst I retain an affedtion for Mr. Bafil, this is likely to fall little Short af a reSolve of ccr libacy, which I am not to preServe in an undisturbed retirement, .but, most probably, to be continually inr

terrupted with offers that I cannot accept, and commands which it is a pain for me not to obey.
Nor have I even the romantic comfort of an affurance that I have fixed my regard on one.of the most excellent of men. It feems that people havdostg been divided in their opinions of this youth,, who, I confefs, appeared to me almost all perfection ; and now the Scale rather preponderates against him.

I can most readily admit, my dear, what you have urged in behalf of

acquittal where the judge makes a

After all, mine is a Situation of fuSpenfe and infelicity j—the draught of life, I perceive, will be early im-bittered to me; nor have I the pro-fpcct of any thing to Sweeten it. I hope my friend will find it more agreeable.

This his Son, befides what he will inherit -from him, amounting to estates of no Small account, has already in poS-Scffion a genteel independence left him by his grandmother.

The Count’s d.iucliter.'who is past: thirty, is on the eve of rnarriage with a French ofliccr; and the c.)ld gentleman fays, it shall not be bis fault, provided Some obstacles are got over, if there is not another

Whilst I hear all this, and cannot be blind to the methods which the lady takes of strewing her partiality for me, my heart is elfewhere,—I re-member that I have left my love in the land where I left my friend;— the image is Sufficient to engroSs my attention. It is thus that, in Spite of my endeavours to the contrary, I am abfent, as it were, in the midst of pleafure, and alone while fur-rounded by company.
At the fiime time I find nothing here but what wears a face agreeable enough; the cshearfulnefs, vivacity, and, if you will, the thoiightleU'nefs of
the Parisians, are not without their / ^

charms; So that if I had not been rather deadened by a long Succession of ills, one could Scarcely help being merry to keep them company.
The infincerity of the French, which people talk So much of, if it
really existed in the degree reported,
can only be a matter of concern in

the more Serious connedlions of life. As much as I value the oppofite virtue, I cannot look for it in every one whom I meet by chance at a coffee-houSe, or a theatre, or join in an aS-fembly-room.—Good humour, and good manners, being all the requisites in Such Situations, it would be quite ufeleSs, by inquiries into the fincerity of the parties, to fuSpend our temporary fatisSadlion.—Not to

Some days after the celebration of the marriage, the bride, now Madame D—, took an opportunity of

I had diffembled an indifpofition before my departure, I was really in-difpoSed on the road, which occa-fioned fome delay in my journey. However, I reached the. next village on the road to Bourdeaux one evening a little before Sun-Set.
At Some Small distance from the town, a young Frenchman, well mounted joined my company; he put

I had but just arifen the next morning, when my Welchman came to rhe, apparently much alarmed, and told me that we v/ere beSet. The meaning of this I could not conceive, but, taking up my pistols, I
hastened to enquire of the landlord,
/
who, as I found, had barricaded the doors, and made all fast, as if he ex-peded a fiege, at the request of the

There was no time to diScourfe farther; for the astailants, confisting of two gentlemen and four attendants, prepared for the attack, and the inn-keeper, having armed three of his people to repel them, was foon joined by myfelf, my Welchman, and the French valet.

I found that an instant determination must be formed, and therefore requested the lady to retire, whilst I advanced to meet her hrother, who was by this time, with all his train, at the gate, the wounded gentleman

Sufferings, my dear friend, are continually proved to be kept pace with by your fortitude.— your prudence is Such as conveys you Safely through the storms of adverSe fate, while your Spirit rifes under misfortune, and makes you greater at the instant that you might be Sup-poSed to fink beneath it.

once thought to inherit all the virtues of a long line of ancestors.— But, alas! what a deviation ! Infatuated by the addreSs of a perfon whom he fuppoSed his friend, he Suffered himfelf to be feduced by him from the paths of religion, wiSdom, •and moral redlitude; he facrificed his
better reaSon at the fhrine of this phantom of friend ship ^ and was the very counterpart of his companion. This was no other than your first rival 5 who, with many qualities that would dishonour perfons in a lower Sphere, is denominated the Honourable J. Holton. Devoid of all good principles himfelf, he instilled his baneful poiSon into the breast of young
Euston.

The nephev/ of Colonel Merton having thrown off all regard for the precepts of his kinfman, and at length for thofe of religion and morality, attempted the chastity of a female, to whom he had introduced himfelf in the most infinuating manner, appearing at first as her protector. His
uncle, his benefactor, chanced to in-
*
terrupt him; and, oppoSing his vicious defigns, fell in the contest.
Need I picture to you the horrors of this youth, who was willing to Surrender himfelf into the hands of j uf-tice. On the return of that reflection, which he had long banished,
he

he could not forgive himSelf, and deemed no earthly punishment equal to his crime. I believe no colours can paint the hue of his defpond-ency.

then knew, from Mr. Holton. He
\
was fuddenly indifpofed, as it was faid, and this occafioned a delay of fomc days, during which time she remained at the place 1 have mentioned, narrowly watched ; and, having once made an attempt of efcaping out of a window, the con-feqiience was her being clofely confined for the future; an old woman

though there was both a lad and a maid Serv-ant, MiSs Stanmore was not Suffered to converfe with them, nor to take any thing from their hands. All this while she was treated with a great shew of refpect, by the agents, except in the articles I have Set down, yet she waited to fee their principal, in the manner that a criminal waits for the day of execution.
♦ » At length the order for travelling
arrived again, and when they had
advanced thirty-five miles, as she
heard them fay; they were met by
Mr. Holton in a post-chariot, into,
which she was conveyed, as Soon as

was nobody to observe them. Your daughter began to remonstrate with Mr. Holton on theSe proceedings. He Said they were the effects of love, and that he could not bear to think of Seeing Lord Mountford in poS-feffion of her charms.—On this She told him that young nobleman had dropped his Suit, and feeing herfelf ' thus in his power, farther affured him fhe never did, nor ever would listen to his Lordfhip if he Should
think of renewing his propofals, in-

Bellgrove-Place, Oflober z5.
T T is with pleaSure I inform you.
Sir, that your daughter is here.
Safe with us. I find you are already acquainted with the means :—and here we alfo have her deliverer, the
best, and most generous of men—a true hero; whofe fortitude has worthily borne him through all afstic-tions;—One that,

228 THE triumphs
I had an hundred pardons to afk; an hundred apologies to make; but Sir Charles cut me Short, with the unSeigned aSTurance oS cordial friendship. Happy is it that he has Succeeded to a plentiful estate, of which, I doubt not, he will make the best uSe imaginable. His brother was on the point of marrying his own houfe-keeper and mistrefs, then with child by him, in order to Secure an heir; but he died; and, whether af-fected by tidings of what must fo much hurt her interest, or from fome other caufe. She has miScarried. The Baronet has ufed her with undeServed tenderneSs, and has provided for her during life. He is not a hypocrite,

but the very pattern of virtue. They were the engines of his brother, who taught people (and me among the rest) to think otherwife, as John Seyward, one of them, but now a convert, will fully inform you. Sir Frederic’s enmity was occafioned by, two circumstances, which redound to this gentleman’s honour (though he choSe to keep them Secret), the one was, his having prevented him from debauching a poor girl in early youth; the other, his hindering this rapacious man from clandestinely
%
posteffing himfelf of the perSon and fortune of an amiable young lady, to whom he had been choSen guardian. It was thus Sir Charles underwent
230 THE TRIUMPHS

Nothing remains now, but that

he fhould prefent himfelf. Sir, before you and Mrs. Stanmore, with your daughter, whom he has So recently reScued from the power of a libertine; and I have the pleaSure to acquaint you, that my Son is refolved
to decline all thoughts of MiSs Ca-

roline, not from pique and refent-ment now, but from a conviction that Sir Charles, who has Suffered but too much, perhaps on account of our family, highly deferves her, and that fhe never can be happy with any other man. They were certainly made for each other,—May blefiings

MRS. SANDBY TO LADY BASIL.
November i6.
^HE day before your letter reached me, my dear Lady BaSil (how happy am I, at last, to call you by that name), my felicity, as I hope, was enfured. By the mutual confent of relations on both fides, Mr. Sandby and I were united, and exchanged thofe vows at the altar which are registered in heaven.

Your good wishes, my dear, there-
fore come perfedly in feaSon. Mine
you

you have always had, and, believe me they are most Servently renewed on this occafion. May health and happineSs wait on you!—Peace and honour crown your loves! and Shame and diSgrace overwhelm thoSe who would interrupt them I
I am inSormed that Holton lies ill, at his Seat at —, not of his wound, Sor that was a flight one, but of a cold he caught at a dance, which has been attended with a fever. It is Said, he was once So near death that he became a convert, through fear, to the doctrines of religion and morality.
On better principles have you ever believed them, and according to the
tenor
♦	's'
tenor of that belief has been your practice;—hence have you both en- ' -
t
countered difficulties with true he-roiSm, and truly evinced that the force of fortitude triumphs over all temporal evils.
Be it our talk to follow Such examples ! and let it be remembered, that a pattern of heroic virtue, in the midst of an age, perhaps as deficient in fortitude as in piety, was
fet by Sir Charles Basil and stie who was once known by the name of Caroline Stanmore.
