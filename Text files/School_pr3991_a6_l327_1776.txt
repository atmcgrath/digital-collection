The Fable of this Piece is admirably well calculated to check the fashionable Vice of keeping^ Mistrestes, by Setting in the strongest Light many Inconveniencies of which that Practice is productive.—The Distrestes of Dafliwood, the Hero of this Piece, owing to his Connection with a- Mifs Bellers previous to his Marriage, are fuch as render him an Object of Pity. The Contrast between the Behaviour of his Mistrefs, who caufes thefe Bistrefles, and that of his Wife, who aims only at removing them, affords an excellent LeSbn in favour of Conjugal Engagements.”

From the fame to the fame.
Budvvorth Place.-
Have feen the lady pointed out for me, and again I fay, ’Tis pity to deceive her.”
My father was' in fuch a hurry to prefent me to Sir Robert, that he would hardly give me time to have my hair drefled, and to change my deaths, though he might have feen plainly by my lingering, and by the excafes which I-made, that I was in no hurry to enter upon the bufinefs. However as the bufinefs was^ to be dorter. the fooner, I thought, the better. Yet,, believ me, Moilyu, I hung back and felt a tremor from head to foot. I never in my whole life was in fo-tremulous a condition..
My father told me that t looked like a fool, and afked me if 1 was afraid of fuch a fine woman, was adually afhamed of the part I was going to. a£t; but it is was to no purpofe—there, was no retreating.—Yet I would have given my life to have been any where but juft where I was.
While I was in this perplexed Situation Sir Ro.-r bert appeared, and welcomed me to Grafton-houfe with a politenefs which I had not expeded, as I had been told that he was inconceivably haughty..
When the fir ft civilities were exchanged, he alked my Lord if he would give him leave to fhew me part of his garden. He then conduded me through a. beautiful fhrubbery in a Serpentine walk, to a ruftic
temple. As foon as I beheld that ftrudure my
eyes
L
[ r I
eyes were powerfully attracted ; not' So much by the edifice itfelf, as by two female forms, which a poet would have called the Divinities of the place. They were both, indeed, very lovely women, and moft elegantly dreffed. T could not help viewing them both with admiration ; and had not my heart beerr engaged, one of them - would certainly have enflaved it; They were fitting near each other e this was painting upon taffeta ; that had a book in her hand; while her.mandoline leaned againft her chair.
They rofe at our entrance with gibwing complexions, which made them look flill moretbeautifuK
Lucy, the eldeft fifler is of a graceful height, and finely formedr She has the mo ft inviting hands and arms to be imagined, and there is a Something in her air extremely pleafing, but a fomething not to be expreffedv I don’t know whether fhe can be properly called-a regular beauty ; but-flae is beyond all doubt, a very bewitching creature. Her complexion is clear, and animated with the moft lively bloom ; her eyes are dark and languifhing, and her cye-lafhes remarkably long and thick, of the fame colour with her hair; which ishrown : her. mouth is rather too wide; but her teeth are white and even. To conclude, her nofe is ftrait and of a-good fize.
I have been very exact, youfee in my defeription; but I cannot poffibly deferibe the mildnefs and b

nignity, nor the becoming mode fly, bordering on timidity, mofl agreeably confpicuous in her Speaking features.
Bab the youngefl daughter, is a very different character;—fuppoSing their difpofitions to be painted

«d iii their faces. She is as talt and as well made as Lucy, but has a fairer and more dazzling complexion. She has the fineft blue eyes I ever beheld. Her hair is a light auburn ; flie has a Grecian n©fe, and the fweeteft little mouth you ever
Saw. Her teeth alfo are very beautiful, and Ihe
•/
frequently exhibits them to advantage with the arch-eft fmiles. Sometimes an alluring foftnefs is diffuf-ed over her whole countenance, which would fure-liy captivate any heart totally free from any attachment.
Charming, however, as the Mifs Graftons are, and as they are generally allowed to be, they muft yield, I think, with regard to perfonal beauty, to my enchanting Die, with her lovely, fparkling, black eyes, and delicately made little ruby mouth, which I now kifs—by the force of fancy.
But to proceed.—-When Sir Robert had introduced us to his daughters, and invited us to take feme re-irelhment, the ladies accompanied us, while we ftrolled about to take views of the pleafanteft parts of the garden, as the weather was uncommonly favourable for that purpofe. Had I been really a lover, i Ihould have thought myfelf quite happy at the familiar manner in which we were brought together, and at the opportunities dexteroufiy contrived for me, that I might make my choice without thofe aukwardneffes with which firft interviews are generally attended. And indeed many a man would have been puzzled, confoundedly puzz,led, upon a Similar occafion; for both the agreeable girls behaved with an eafy freedom Sufficient to encourage one to believe that neither of them would
receive
[ 9 I
receive my addrefTes with rein Stance. On a farther converfation with them, however, Lucy appeared not to be quite fo much at eafe as her lifter. She blulhed and trembled when I approached her, though by accident; and Seemed to be delicately fearful of difpleaSing me, of of not plealing as much as Ihe wiflied. Perhaps I fancied fhe was fo, becaufe Ihe moft engaged my attention. No—•! could not be raiftaken. When I chatted moft to Bab, a hidden fericufnefs overfpread her gentle countenance ; but when I returned to her, joy feemed to flufh her delicate cheek, and every fear ture was expreluve of delight,
I prefented to her a fine bunch of orange flowery which I had taken, at Sir Robert’s deSire from a remarkable fine tree in the green-houfe as we palTr ed it. As our hands met, heFs trembled excefi-
I was, therefore, infenSibly impelled, to
fively.
olfer mine to Support her, and flie accepted of them with a blufti, accompanied with a, half fup--prefled figh. If I marry one of tiiem, Lucy mufti be the girl ; though there is a provoking vivacity in Bab, which would pleafe a. thoufand, men j but P find Mils Bruton Sufficiently lively.
When I returned home,, my father eagerly alked me how I liked the Mifs Graftons, and which of them I liked beftv
I would have artfully evaded a dire^ anfwer, by declaring in favour of them both ; but. my evafive reply would net doi.
My lord growing peremptory, I named Lucy ; and by naming her had, at leaft, the fatisfaftion to find my tafte approved of by his. lordfhip.. And
new.
[ 10 ]
BOW, what 13 to be done with Die ? Can yoo, of any other man, tel! me ? I muft let her know that ®or connexion cannot poffibly be continued, and yet how I fhudder to think of the condition into which my information will throw her. Befides, there is mv dear little Edward. Sweet fellow I
what has he done to be abandoned, and juft when
%
he is of an age to be exquifitely entertaining to his fond father. There is no occafion, you will fay to give him up; but I know fhe will never part with her boy, and I cannot live without feeing him. Who will provide for his future fubfiftence ? Who will watch over his tender youth ? Who will give him proper inftru6tions and teach him to be a better man than his father ? 1 cannot proceed, I am absolutely undone by having fuffered my paf-fjons to run away with me. Say any thing, fay every thing you can to raife my drooping Spirits: I was nbver fo hw in my life.

M ifs Grafton, in C onti nuat ion.
O H, Cecilia! how fhall I exprefs my joy ! It is unutterable. Happily I am chofen by this dear delightful man.
Lord Budworth this morning acquainted my father with his fon’s determination in my favour, who begged he might be permitted to endeavour to gain a heart, which he fhould look upon as the moft valuable acquilition in the world. 1 repeat his lord-fhip’s words who delivered them as coming from

I am almoft deprived of my fenfes through terror and delight; and Shall be hardly able to bear the approaching permitted interview, for fear I fhould not pleafe as I wifh to pleafe.
I can’t flay any longer ; I mufl hurry to drefs ; I will neglefil nothing to render myfelf agreeable to fuch a man. Bab has jufl rufhed into my room. She fays She will conclude m) letter. I can’t flay to opp«fe her.
Mifs Barbara, in Continuation.
I haVe looked over what She has written. She has drawn, ’tis true, a lively pidlure of Dafhwood, but not too flattering a one. He is really an elegant creature; and fo will fhe be when She is drefl, if She ever gets through the buSinefs of the toilet j but file is too anxious. I don’t believe fhe will be able to Support the expedled interview as fhe ought to do. I know fhe will look foolifh, and then of courfe, the charming fellow will conclude fhe is over head and ears in love, and fo there will be nothing left for him to fay.
I like Dafhwood, probably as much as Huey does; and had he chofen me, though I think myfelf fortunate in not having been the objedl of his choice, I Should have behaved very much like a Simpleton. As no man has hitherto attempted to make me look like a fool, I am willing to keep off the evil day as long as I can. It mufl indeed, I fear come in the end; but the longer it is postponed, the better I Shall be prepared for it. 1 fliall have a fine op-

LETTER V.
The Honourable Edward Dash wood to
Sir Francis Mostyn, Bart.
I AM now engaged, and mu ft go thro’ w^ith it, let what will be the confequence. I am determined to give my deftined wife no reafon to complain of me, and yet I am not in love neither ; but I ftiould be highly to blame to wound her peace ; I ftiould be deftitute of humanity were I capable of planting a dagger in the gentle tender bofom of a woman wdio loves me beyond expreflion. Don’t think me vain for faying fo. Yet who would not be vain of fo fine a creature’s love ? Had I not long ago been firmly attached to another, I muft have thought myfelf Supremely happy with her. You look aftoniftied, methinks, and imagine mo to be a complete coxcomb. I muft, therefore, be more particular left you ftiould accufe me of being too partial to myfelf.
1 fet out in no very good humour for this bufi-nefs, as you may fuppofe. However, as nothing
more
[ 1
was to be negle£Ied on my part, from mere rerpe^S:-to the lady, I drefled and went, but juft before their hour of dining, in dread of a tite a tete beyond aft things.
I was- received by Sir Robert with ftill more cordiality than before ; by Mifs Bab with an agreeable freedom : while Mlfs Grafton ftrove to imitate her Sifter’s unconftrained behaviour, but could not—She looked abafhed, though pleafedflie endeavoured to exprefs her fatisfaction, but war difconcerted.
When dinner and coffee were over, v/e all went through the winding, Ihady walk, already mentioned, to the temple in which I found my goddeSs,, On our entrance Sir Robert and Bab Stole awa'’’.

and left me with the dear girl.—Surely to be in -troduced with much ceremony to make hve^ according to the common phrafe, is to appear in a very aukward light; efpecially when one does not care three farthings-for the woman.—However, I was not altogether in tliat Situation : attached as my heart is to another, Tcould not-be blind; I could not be infenfible* I faw, I felt, and I pitied Lucy’s confufion, which was attended with a blufh-ing timidity that gave her new-beauties, and could not fail of charming the moft obdurate hearts I took her hand to lead her to a feat.—The fincft hand I ever touched (even Die’s, fo long; fo much admired, is not fo beautiful;—but it' trembled fo exceedingly, that L was obliged to detain it, in

B 2	fore
[ ]
fore began to flatter myfelf that I fliould not Succeed : but considering that there was another filler, and that there was little probability of my being rejected by them both, I could not fupprefs a figh, which was returned by the lady.—There was then you know, a necefllty for my faying that I hoped the permifllon with which Sir Robert had honoured me, to endeavour to make my addreffes agreeable to her, had not produced the difquiet
under which She vifibly laboured.—-! was going to add, that I would withdraw all my pretenfions to her favour, if my apprehenSions were well grounded.
Fearfully lifting up her lovely eyes with a bewitching foftneSs in them, and then calling them niodeSUy down again, She Said, with a Sweet, but

She alfoShew^ed Such a deference to what file politely called my Superior judgment, while her languishing eyes were full of tendernefs, that I could not have mistaken the caufe of her particular carriage, had not her blufnes.

No eafy one is it to any man, I prefume, to perfuade a woman whom he fincerely loves, and by whom he is fondly beloved, to confent to an eternal Separation. I Equally trembled while I wrote, well knowing that what I wrote would be perufed with the greateft difturb-ance of mind.—I was not miftaken.
I difpatched my letter by Hopkins; ordering him to wait, and bring me back an anfwer. The poor creature was utterly incapable of returning a line to me. She fell out of one fit into another, and Ellis, her woman, has Sent me word that un-lefs I come to town, and endeavour to calm her mind, fhe cannot anfwer either for her fenfes or her life.
telligence had on me.—I Scarce {laid to t.ike a Short leave of Lucy, but flew to London, pretending urgent bufinefs.
I found my poor Die an object of pity indeed.
The moment I entered her apartment I beheld her reclined on a Sopha, with her fine hair dishevelled, and more like a mad woman than a rational

She roSe inftantly, and taking the child by the hand, led him to me, while (he threw herfelf at my feet, and with the moft moving accents, while tears at the fame time ftreaming from her lovely eyes, intreated me not to think of leaving her, if

I catched
I fwear you Ihall not.”
I raifed her immediately in my arms my weeping boy to my bofom, and prefled his dear innocent cheek to mine. I then ftrove to make ufe of all my eloquence to reconcile her to a proceeding on my part, which nothing but necefllty, cruel necelTity, could have driven me to—letting her, by degrees, into the Bate of my affairs, that fhe might plainly fee how impoITible it would be for me to fupport her any longer without an increafe of income, by the acquifition of which I fhould be enabled to provide, decently at leaf!:, if not affluently, for herfelf and her child.
And is he not yours alfo, replied fhe—too well you know he is.— Is he not ftrikingly like his dear lovely, inconftant father?”
Do not upbraid me. Die, for what I never fhould have confented to, neither on Mils Grafton’s account, nor on your’s, could I have pofllbly

avoided it. She is as little dcferving to be deceived as you ; and yet fhe is the only deluded perfon.
Oh! do not pity her. Said Die; you Speak of her as if you loved her.—“ Villain ! added Ihe, (riling in a fury) I am Sure you da.—But where is fhe?—I will find her out—I will tear out thofe eyes that have feduced you.’*
If you w'ill be cairn, replied I, interrupting her, you fliall have no reafon to be jealous; but if you give way to this impetuofity, I will leave you for ever.”
This Speech Silenced her for a moment, though it could not compoSe her agitated mind; for fhe ihook all over, and her fine face was every now and then diftorted with the pangs which I moil; unwillingly had occasioned.—H--------ns! what w'^as
my.

But as paft hours could not be recalled, I was obliged to go on. I, therfore, again intreated her to hear me.—I again told her my reafons for entering into a ftate, to which VJe alone had given me a difguft; and added that nothing but my inability to Secure a maintenance for her had prompted me to liflen to fuch a propofal, infilled upon, however, by my father, who had luckily been ig-

As I was almoft neceffarily reduced, while I expatiated on this fubject, to hint at the great expence which my Support of her had occafioned, fhe burft into a violent fhower of teas.—“ Had you ever informed me, faid Ihe, of your being not in a Situation to Support me in a way of life to which I have been accuftomed, I Should have retrenched all Superfluities, and pra£tiSed the ftrict-eft ceconomy, rather than have driven you to fly to So dreadful a remedy.”—But I knew that all Ihe faid about oeconomy came only from her lips. Bred up in the molt luxurious ftyle of living, and indulged from her infancy with the gratification of her heart’s every, mofl; fantallic wilh, Ihe had not the leafl: idea of frugality; fhe could never think of denying herSelf the Ilightefl; trifle, which her inclination demanded.—She alTured me, however, that Ihe would diredfly retire to the cheapefl lodgings fhe could meet with, in the obfcureft part of the town, if I would only, promife to fee her as ufual.—“ This boy, continued Ihe, devouring him with carelTes, this darling boy,, the exafil re-Scmblance of his father, fhall Ihare his mother’s penury, to preferve that father’s love for her.”
I could not bear to hear her talk thus.—She melted my foul.—I begged her in themoft earnefl manner to compofe her Self, as Ihe would abfolutely diftradt me if fhe remained in So agitated a condition.

Mifs Bellers, however, was too obftinate and perverfe to pay any regard to the advice or the reproof of her beft, and indeed her

houfe, fhe was at firfl treacheroufly Seduced by him, but afterwards eaSily prevailed on to live with him in the mold unreputable light: though fhc has Since a thoufand times declared that Hie never loved him, but that being forfaken by her benefa(StfeSs, fhe had no other afylum to fly to.

I could not but endeavour to relieve an objedl appearing to me to be So worthy of relief. I took her immediately from that infamous houSe, and placed her in private lodgings. By So accommodating her, I at firft only, I poffitively aver, deligned to affiSl her in eScaping from So pernicious a dwelling, and to put her into Some way of providing for herfelf, without the corruption of her morals, and the deftruc-. tion of her peace ; but She poured out her gratitude in So moving a manner for what I had already done, that I was quite unmanned by it: I was foftened to a degree not to be deferibed, and before I was aware owned a palllon which I, however, attempted not to gratify without her entire approbation. Her confent was not long wanting: Ihe Soon, indeed, though with floods of tears, confelT-ed that Ihe loved me beyond either life or honour. After Such a confellion, you may imagine that there was little ceremony on my fide, and as little reludlance on her’s. ’Tis impoflible to tell you how much her fociety charmed me; I can only fay that I was absolutely intoxicated with it: and the aflFefling dillrefs in which Ihe always appeared whenever there was the'mofl; remote hint of a Separation, Served but to Ilrengthen my attachment to her.

The
dread

[ 37 ]
dread of difgufting him on a nearer intimacy, or, at leaft, of not pleaSing him according to my earned: deSire, fills me with a thoufand anxieties; and I Sometimes, indeed, fancy that it would be infinitely more painful for me to part with Mr. Dafhwood than for him to be fef>arated from me. I have no caufe, I own, to complain of him as a lover, but he appears frequently loft in thought, and falls into fuch reveries, from which he never recovers without the ftrongeft marks of confuSion, that I cannot any way account for his abftradted behaviour. It fills rne with the fofteft pity, and forces to difcover more tendernefs than may be necef-fary. Yet will you not permit me to confefs, that Mr. Dalhwood is become very dear to my fond heart; So dear that I cannot fee him labour under the flighteft difquiet, without feeling mySelf ready to offer up my life to remove it: and furely I do not go too lar by faying fo, for he always receives every proof of my affection in the moft endearing manner. I cannot help loving him fo fincerely; yet did I imagine that I difpleafed him by loving him fo much, 1 would try to love him lefs.
Bab, will you believe it, my dear, is certainly very much taken with lord Charbury, who is, really every way deferving of all that my Dalhwood has faid in his favour; his perfon and his rnanners are quite unexceptionable.—I have not a ^reat deal of time, indeed, to mind the affairs of other people, atprefent; but I cannot help, from my own lenfitions, becoming a more knowing adept in love affairs every hour; and I think I fee' nothing	the lover in my lord.

wlthBanding this fuppofed indifference, very much with us, both at home, and in all our parties.—-As the friend of Mr. Dafhvvood, his intimacy increafes in our family, and Bab and he are, of courfe, perpetually together. The little gipfy, I can fee, plays off all her charms ; but I do not find that they • have yet done any execution. Lord Charbury is naturally of a Serious turn, though often a very Sprightly cornpanion. Bab takes an infinite deal of pains to make him as wild as herfelf; and he will Sometimes, as if merely to divert both her and himfelf, fall in with her whims; but
he
Seems generally to fall in with them rather through complaisance than inclination. My father is prodi-gioufly fond of him. You know my father’s paflion for rank, which would, I dare fay. Setting afide the advantageoufnefs of Such a match, make him re-folve to fix his lordxhip for a fon-in-law. He therefore, encourages his viSits, and enters into all Bab’s devices to amufe him, at lead; to attradl his attention.—Sir Robert has alfo permitted her to give a definitive anfvver to Sir Richard Nevil, who has been, you know, for Some time, her admirer, and who was kept in fuSpence by my father—;(though much a2;ainfi: mv Sifter’s will, as She always declared She

that my lord will be accepted as foon as he offers hiimfelf. Mr. Dafhvvood thinks, with me. that
Bab is by no means averfe to his friend; and when

gaged.—The cafe is this: the late lord Charbury was left guardian to a mlfs Lewfon by her father, who was his particular friend, and who always ex-prelTed a deSire that fhe might be, at a proper age, married to his fon, provided the young people had no objection to each other; but as Mifs Lewfon was not marriageable at her father’s death, and as the prefent lord was abroad, a union between them could not at that time be thou2;ht of. She was
o
continued at the fame fchool in which her lather had placed Her, by her guardian, v/ho died before his fon’s return to England. She was then left to this young gentleman’s care. Lord Charbury found among his father’s papers a few lines, in which Condantia v/as flrongly recommended to him for a wife, if they liked each other well enough to enter into the married date together; but as my lord has declared that he does not like to take a girl from fchool to marry her, and as they have no female relations with whom fhe can be properly trufled, nothing has been determined. I have often heard him fay that flie is handfome and fenfible, and lament his being unable to know what to do with her. I never heard that he was in love with her; but I am inclined to believe that he has rather a delire
to adf agreeable to his father’s inclination.
Thus far Mr. Dafhwood.—And now tell me, my friend, if you think there are any hopes for my Sifter.—You muft not, however, mention any thing of what I have written to her, as fhe would moft probably never forgive my feeing—what, with all her heart and addrefs, fhe has not been able to hide.-—I fometimes think that lord Charbury is* too

HIS poor wretched woman will not let me enjoy a moment’s reft; ftie will make me as unhappy as herfelf. She had, I told you, written to me Several times fince I left her. In the laft I received, ihe fo ftrongly claimed my promife to fee her once again before the dreadful ceremony was performed, and concluded with fo mdny'threats of vengeance, not only againft Mifs Grafton, but againft herfelf, that I could not withftand the ear-neft, and indeed alarming Summons, especially as file repeatedly aflured me, that the fight of me, though for the laft time, would make her more calm.
I parted from Lucy, pretending that I was going to accelerate matters towards ^ day, which I am in no hurry to fee. How few men in my Situation would talk thus, juft on the point of poffeffing one of the fineft women in England; a woman too who loves me, fondly loves me ; for when I bade her adieu, her head dropped, and Ihe looked like a blufliing rofe covered with pearly dew, broke from
its ftalk.—Believe me, Frank, I kilfed away her
tears,
[ 41	]
tears, and alinoil wifhed I had not talked of leaving her.—Something of that fort efcaped me in my hurry ; the gentle girl fearing, I imagine, that Sue had offended me, by difcovering fo much Sorrow at
my leaving her, ralfed her charming head again, and with a modefl blufh begged me to excufe her, if fhe had too warmly expreffed the concern (he felt on my approaching departure “ 1 well knew, Mr. Dalhwood, continued the dear creature, that a woman’s affedtion and fears may be fometimes rather too troublefbme ; yet I hope I may rationally expe<3; pardon from fo amiable a man.”—< What an excellent difpofitionl-*—Hov/ Tadore her for it!
“ But it would not keep you from Die ?’■
True—true, my friend, becaufe companion led me to her.—Oh, Moftyn! what would I not give to find Die of fo heavenly a temper r—And yet I mail here contradld myfelf; for if die was, I mufl either marry her, or Suffer flill a thoufand times more anguiih on her account than Ido already. For furely it muSt be infinitely more cutting to be pained for an angel than for a fiend; and Die, at prefent, I think, too much refembles the latter.
1 was received with the keeneil reproaches and upbraidings, during which foe forget every thing due to her fex and me; and vented Such volleys of execrations again ft the innocent girl, whom lam going to marry, againft the joining of our hands, againft the nuptial bed. Sic. See. that one would have actually Set her down for a lunatic, had ftie not immediately come to herSelf upon my treating her with my former endearments. With the ut-

■ \
‘	[	42	]
moll difficulty I prevailed on her to tell me why ihe Summoned me in Such a hurry.—After having fainted a>yay twice or thrice, and as often attempted to deftroy herfelf, Ihe vowed that the day on which I was wedded to Lucy, fhould be the laft of
her life, and the moft accurfed of the year, unlefs I would take the mod: Solemn oath not to abandon her totally, but to fee her frequently,' and never to Shew any more attention to the girl, whom I was determined to marry, than was absolutely neceffary in order to keep fair with the family.
I aiked her calmly how She could reafonably ex-
\ J	I
pect to Share the lady’s fortune, when flie grudged her a lhare of my love.
“ Love! replied Ihe-—-Oh! name it not—the bare idea is not to be borne. You Ihall not, dare not love her.——BeSides, how little does fhe dcferve your love, compared tome! Your connection with her is in confequence of a fordid compadl made between two mfercenary fathers, by which you acquire a large addition to your fortune, and fhe
gains'^—H----ns!—a man for whom all the reil of
her fex would give up fortune, reputation, health. Life-—ever thing moft precious to them j W'hile /■ but I will net boaft of what I have done; /freely, willingly, confented to fit down with lofs of cha-radler, though it might have been through your ge-nerofity retrieved; and would moft readily, moft chearfully part with my life to make your’s happy.
As to my life, indeed, I ftiall neither be able nor defirous to preferve it, after being deprived of you; yet I confefs it v/ill give me a cruel pang in my laft moments, to know thatyowr’/ can only be made
Irappy by a union with this-^Oh! let me not name
her,
[ 43 ]
her, let me not think of her—this devil, who is to rob me of my dear charming Dafhwood, the father of my wretched undone child.’’
Here fits quick Succeeded each other. The poor innocent fellow roared and cried that his mother was dead.—She too increafed my diftrefs, by telling him, recovering a little, that I would kill her with mv cruelty.
J
The fcene that followed would have, J believe, touched the moil obdurate heart.—1 could not Hand
it.
The frighted boy, with the mod pity-moving looks, turning his eyes firft towards his mother, and then towards me, fobbed out, ** Dear, dear papa—. dont’t hurt my poor mama—kill me papa—had rather die than my mama ”—clinging about my knees.—I could not Hand it— I was melted.
Catching up the dear amiable boy in my arms, and drying his poor wet cheek, I told him I would do every thing in my power to preferve him and his mother too.
Hanging upon my neck, he begged to day with me.
Why, my dear Ned, faid I, don’t you love your mama bed ?

“ YesT do, replied the fweet child; but fhe frights me fo that I had rather live with you.”
Poor innocent! may I be permitted toTay that his choice was mod judicious ? How I widied to confirm it, and to take him from this furious woman, who will quite fpoil his temper, as few children at his age have fo much fenfibility, or brighter parts. The more likely, therefore, is he to be Spoilt .—But
to
[ 44 ]
to take him from her now, would be to make her
mad indeed, and where to place him I know not.
•I, who ought to be his inftrudlor, I, who am is doating father, am afhamed to own him.—^How fe-
verely, but how juftly, am I puniSticd for my folly;
never to have it in my power to make my much
loved fon the inheritor of my name and fortune, but doomed to fee him innocently Suffering, for ever
deprived of his father’s protection, and for his fa-
ther’s indiscretion condemned to ignominy.—My heart bleeds for him; for, if I am not miftaken.
this dear child is as good as he is unfortunate
Why then fhould I afflict myfeif about him? Will he not with an agreeable temper and an amiable heart be as truly deferving as if he was the lawful
heir to the liighefl: title, and to the krgeft eftate in the kingdom ?—Is not virtue far beyond birth, and and is not internal merit Superior to all outward advantages ? Undoubtedly: but when I confider how liable a youth with fo tender, fo yielding a heart, is to be drawn' into the very fame errors, the remembrance of which at this moment fill me whth contri-
tion and remorfe, how can I help feeling a thcufanci fears for my little Edward ? How can I help wifhi n

Then, turning to me, {he faid, “ And fo you want to make me completely miferable, you' want to take my child from me.—I fee your drift.—But you fhall not carry your deSign into execution.' No, Sir—he is my own; and Sooner than I will give him up to you, we will both ftarve together.—No ■I will die a thoufand deaths before I will part with him, and for this one moft unnatural wifh of your’s, may your hated marriage-bed be ever child-lefsl—may your curfed wife be barren!—But why do I Spend my breath thus, and wafte the little ftrength I have left, added fhe, Softening her voice, in calling down vengeance on your head, my Dafh^ wood, when you may yet remember your promife, and then I may pafs the remainder of my life Short will the remainder of it be when I am deprived of you--~d\n Some fort of peace ?

When I was on the point of taking my leave of her, fhe faid, with a deep Sigh, Well, before we meet again, you will be married.—Flow fhall I know the day ?—Yet I would be ignorant of it, if poffible, for ever.^Don’t mention it—don’t fpeak to her.—But it cannot be concealed—I fhall fee it

Thus we parted, and I am to fet out to Grafton houfe in an hour, not to return till I am bound in indiflbluble chains. However, were this Die quite

How happy Ihould I be, how highly fhould I relifli the congratulations which have been poured in upon me from all quarters during this lail week, were I not apprehenfive of having my prefent domeftic felicity cruelly interrupted, if not totally deftroyed, by the machinations of a woman raging with the pangs of jealoufy, and breathing nothing but revenge.

We are drongly prcifed by Sir Robert to remain with him for Some time. But who do you think Bab has got for a companion to Supply the place of her Sider ? Only Mifs Lewibn. Bab has fomehow managed matters with fo much dexterity,
that
[ 48 ]
that while I and Lucy were engaged together^ (he prevailed on lord Charbury to open his heart to her . about this fine girl, who is really too old to be at aboarding-fchool. Hislordfhip having exprefledhis embarraffment about her, Bab very generoully invited her to come and live with her. My lord jumped at the propoSal, and brought her hither before our marriage, becaufe fhe had never been at a wedding.
Conftantia Lewfon is a very fine girl; her perfon is blooming and attradfive; her manners are amiable, and not the lefs fo for the timidity with which they are accompanied. In fhort, fixe looks as if jhe would be a formidable rival to my arch Sifter, who treats her, however, to all appearance, with great affection and efteem. Were I obliged to fay who has the moft considerable Ihare of lord Charbu-ry’s admiration, Conftantia, Bab, or my wife, my declaration would certainly be in favour of the laft of thefe three Graces, as his lordfhip always appeared to prefer her to the other two; perhaps politically, to prevent their being jealous. But I thought 1 obferved his prepolTeflion for Lucy before Mifs Lewibn came hither. Were Bab ten times handfomer than file is, and Lucy far lefs lovely, thejatter would ft ill, in my opinion, be the moft alluring, and win the greateft number of hearts, from the peculiar gentlenefs in her manners, not commonly met with in her fex, by which even her features are rendered more enchanting.
I want, methinks, to know how Die bears this change in my affairs ; and am aftonifhed that I have heard nothing of her Since mv marriage.

He was rather at a lofs, I imagine, to know how to introduce her properly into the world; and as Lucy’s marriage gave me a very good opportunity to have her with me, I could manage the affair without being particular.

I Should not be forry to accompany that cold word ejieemed with a Softer one ; but I fear I fhall never be able to infpire him with the tender paBion.—Some women now in my Situation would be incliped to make a little love themfelves.—You know what I mean child ?—Difcover their inclination to them by fome flratagera or other.—'But I am above all that.—No, Cecilia, as much as I prefer him to all the men in the world, I deteft fiach mean proceedings.—My pride will never fuffer me So far to degrade rayfelf as to difcover a partiality for a man who Shews not the lead: prepoflefTion in my favour. However, while I am thus keeping a dif-creet diftance, and Supporting my dignity with a becoming Spirit, I’ll lay any wager that my young artlefs friend here carries off her man.—She is
certainly

certainly in love with him ; ay, and deeply too though Ihe does not Seem to know it.—-She fighs when he is abfent, and bluShes when he is mentioned; nay, whenever he appears flie flies to meet him, and drelSes her pretty innocent face in Smiles, which makes it look ftill more beautiful. He treats her with all the good-nature of a brother; he has not the leafl: appearance of a lover; but thefe Serious, Sober fellows are always aflonilhingly Ily : and I Sometimes fancy that fhe will be contented if he behaves to her with no greater fondnefs than he does at prefent, provided he does not difeover more for any other woman.
I leave them frequently alone.—They both, I think. Seem pleaSed with my doing So.—Am I not extremely convenient ? I am Sure lord Charbury has reafon to be fatisfied with me; and indeed he appears So—Yet he takes care not to make too many acknowledgments : he leaves them to Con-ftantia, who performs her part admirably, and Sometimes overpowers me with her affeOiion. However, I am afraid I feel fomething very like envy and jealouly now and then.—I hate myfelf for looking on the Sweet girl with the eyes of a rival, whom I actually love, nevertheless, becaufe I am certain that in profefling a regard for me, Ihe Speaks the language of her heart. She pays an implicit obedience to me as well as to my lord.— I am to carry her to Mrs. Dalhwood’s next week. She will then be introduced, for the firfl: time, to the public diverllons ; and Ihe will exhibit the prettiell little figure that has appeared a great while. Perhaps Ihe may charm Some new objeQ:, and

The Honourable Edward Dashwood to

Berkley-fquare,
ON E inconvenience has attended my coming
to town, which I indeed expefiled.—I am too near Die.—She will not let me be at peace.— She is for ever fending for me, and wmtching me ilfo, I fancy, as I frequently fee her fellow lurking about, as if he was employed for that purpofe ; fo that I dare not even come to the window with my wife, left this devil ffiould be informed of it.
Yet how laudable is every proof of my ten-dernefs to a woman, who fo truly deferves it, by making it her whole fludy to pleafe tne Be-fides, did fhe not merit it by her unabated attentions, is fhe not mv wife ? Flave I not Sworn to love and cherifh her ? Is it not my duty, and ought it not to be my inclination to keep my oath inviolate ?
1 have Seen Die Since I came to town as often as I could be reafonably expedted by her, I have Settled a handfome annuity on her and her fon out
of

She is always endeavouring to introduce foniething which alludes to my wife, and then proceeds to find fault with, and cavil at her in a manner beyond endurance. She certainly has her fpies every where j for ihe often informs me of circumfiances with which fhe could not pofllbly, I think, be acquainted, except fhe was in the houfe with me.—Nay I fw^ear, I believe fhe can tell exadfly how often I kifs my wife ; and whenever I attempt by my endearments to put a flop to filch idle nonfenfe, fhe pufhes me from her, telling me fhe can tafle Lucy’s kiffes-—fhe never calls her Mrs. Dafhwood, or my wife—^on my lips. If 1 chide her ever fo gently for fuch behaviour, or only look difpleafhd without faying a fyllable, fhe either burfls into a flood of tears, or falls into a fit, out of which fne cannot be recovered in Some hours.—When fhe is in fuch a condition I don’t know how to leave her : I am, infen-fibly induced to flay with her till fhe is better, and am very frequently tempted, in hopes of conciliating her to me, to give her anexpenfive toy,
Th is difpoSition of mine, however, drew me into a curfed fcrape the other day ; I had bought
F 2	fo

Happening to go into a Ihop , to chufe a ring for Die, I faw one which might, 1 thought, be ae-
ceptable to Lucy, and accor
purchafed a
couple.*^A gentleman of my acquaintance at that moment coming by, dragged me away with him, and prevented me from going home firfl according to my intention.—-Being near Die’s lodgings when we parted, 1 ftepped in, and taking out the ring I had purchafed for her, that which I had bought for my wife unluckily fell upon the floor.—She inftantly picked it up, and cried, ** What, have you got two rings for me ?”
“ No, replied I—not thinking it necefiary for her to have them both at once—putting it oh—is what I chofe for	.
“ And for whom is the other faid fhe, without calling her eyes on the new ornament to her finger—without even thanking me for it.
'Sins cjueition embarralTed me, I confefs not a —I was weak enough to be afraid of telling her what I intended to do with it, becaufe I knew that Sue would relent my difeovering any attention to my wife. I therefore laid, that I had at firll taken the other ring, but not liking it lo well as the ring I had jull put on her finger, would carry it back again.

WE have been in town above a week,
and engaged perpetually : hurrying from one diversion to another, or elfe you would have heard from me before.—Yet neither the novelty of the place, nor its gaieties, nor the alTiduities of fine fellows crowding round her, have any effect upon Conllantia. She lighs, in fecret, for Gharbury, who has not yet joined us.
“ If Conllantia’s palTion is a fecret, how came you to know it ?”
Pofllbly, I guefs at her feelings by my own. However, be that as it will, her indifference to every thing about her, her perfedf inattention, her reftleffnefs, and her frequent reveries, convince me thoroughly that fhe thinks more on what fhe has left behind than on what fhe meets with here j though every thing is done to amufe her, and though fhe has already had a number of admirers.—-Dafh wood and my lifter Spare no pains to entertain us, and to give us pleafure : they feem entirely happy in each other. Lucy, though, I think, not in full health, (perhaps there may be a reafon for that) never looked handfomer, never Seemed more completely fatisfied. >— Dafhwood treats her in the moft agreeable manner to be imagined.—Were all men like him, no woman would be afraid of matrimony.—Yet, though he
is fo affeiSlionately follicitous to pleafe her, a gloom
Sometimes
[ 68 ]
fometliJies overfpreads his fine face, which makes us fear that he is not well, or that Something gives him difquict. My (liler now and then, though with gre?at tcndernefs, ventures to exprefs her anxiety about Ids health : but as her enquiries only produce new endearments from him, fhe is not profufe of them. She indeed often fears, and I believe hopes, that fhe is miftaken.—But what can make fo fenSible, fo amiable a man, fo mighty ferious at times ?—In Short, men are incomprehensible creatures, and fo I will have done- with them.—However, I mull Speak a word or two about Afh.
Afh followed me to town diredlly; he has dangled after me ever Since ; and 1 am determined to encourage him, right or wrong, till I fee if my encouragement makes any imprellion upon Char-bury, whom I expeSt every hour.—If he does not come foon, I fhall, 1 am certain, be obliged to return with Conftantla, who begins to grow, very refUeia. She was exclaiming yeflerday againft London with Such violence,, and launched out. into Such extravagant praifes on the country, that I told her I fancied fhe had' left her heart behind her, and muil go down after it..
Her face and neck immediately glowed like crimfon. She hung her. head,, and looked fo extremely Silly, that. I almoft pitied her, and yet could not help telling her. that if fhe went on figh-ing and pining thus, Lmufl carry her. to Grafton houfe for a change of air-^though perhaps, added
I, you had rather go to Elm Park,, child.

My dear Bab, replied the poor girl, blufhing almofl: to tears, pray Spare me.—I Shall be very-happy with you wherever you are.”
“ You would be a great deal happier child. Said I, if lord Charbufy was here i but have a little patience, ConSlantia ; when he is mariied, you may live entirely with his lady.”
“ Married! exclaimed She> with a ftill deeper bluSh.—Then inShmtly turning as pale as death, is he going to be married, madam ? continued She, and turned her face frorn me to wipe the tears which ruShed into her eyes.
“ No, faid I; but he undoubtedly w/7/ marry : fuch a fine young fellow, and fo uncommonly fo* ber for a man of faShion, will not certainly alwaysr live without a wife.”
This Speech was on purpofe to make her think reasonably about an event, which may poffibly happen, contrary to her wifhes: but fhe is really farther gone than I could have believed; for fhe could not, without the greateft difficulty, recover herSelf from the confufion into v/hich my conjectures had thrown her,—She would have left the room, but I detained her.—“ Why Sure, child. Said I, you could not be Sorry to See lord Charbury happily married, as you have fuch a prodigious efteeni for him.”
“ Ought I not to elleem him ? replied fhe ; has he not been very good to me ? and have you not juft now Spoken in his praife?”
“ Yes, my dear Conflantia, faid I, no woman iipon earth can have a higher opinion of a man than I have of lord Charbury.”
“ Then

We Ihall fee.—I am likely to be put to my trial: for if Charbury marries mifs Lewfon I Ihall have eccaSion for all my fortitude.—And I believe it will be wanted, if he happens to be as much prejudiced in favour as Ihe is in his.—We have got, indeed, two other lovers to comfort us for the prefent.—The one is a gentle thing, gentle as ourfelves; the other quite a gay fellow, almoft as mad as I am; but neither of them are to my young friend’s tafte.—h,o—Ihe will certainly die if Ihe has not the man on whom Ihe has fettled her affections.——In that cafe, if he Ihould happen to prefer me, I muft^^—give him up.

In truth he could not have applied to a more improper perfon, at a more improper time; for I was little lefs agitated than the poor trembling girl, w'ho was juft ready to own her paflion for him : but luckily Conftantia, who, with all het Simplicity, began, I believe, to fee that things were going rather too far, Seized the moment whei he turned to Speak to me, and left the room.

We went early, being Sure of a crowded houSe, and my matron-like Lucy, putting the two girls before her, I placed myielf behind her, as well to take care that fhe did not encreafe her cold, as to affift her if fhe fhould not be well.—You may laugh at me if you will ; but I could not have Spent an evening more agreeably, had not my ap-prehenflons on her account diflurbed me. I was very much afraid indeed that the exceffive heat of the houfe, added to the agitation of her paflions, would be prejudicial to her; for fhe is not yet in a condition to bear much fatigue. I, therefore, as foon as the play was over, and the crowd a little difperfed, led her carefully to the coach, firft tying her cloak myfelf that I might be fure fhe was kept warm, till fhe got home.

much frighted to do any thing. She has, indeed, by her faintings and tears plainly dilcovered that Ihe cannot live without him. I never Saw a poor creature fo affedted in my life.—I have been very bad myfelf, but behaved tolerably; at leaft, I hope, I kept down every pailion but efteem; though I will own that I Suffered not a little by endeavouring to ftifle many emotions upon the trying occaSion. The dear Sick creature has behaved like an angel, tenderly compalTionating the wretched Conftantia wretched ihe has been indeed—and Shewing a refpedtful friendship forme.—For my part—however ftrange my declaration may appear—I never have been So happy and So milerable in my life ; trembling with terror, almoil; Sinking with concern, and yet charmed to a degree beyond expreffion at the very great Satisfaction which he discovered at my affiduity and Solicitude about him.

On a Sudden hearing him Sigh, I opened the curtain in a hurry to fee if any thing was the matter, quite forgetting my own fituation.

Lord Charbury to the Honourable Edward
Dash wo o d.
WHAT a violent ftruggle have I had, my[
dear Dafhwood, between compaflion and inclination !—W hat has it not coft me to tear my-felf from the woman of my choice, and to bring myfelf to give my hand to an amiable young creature, who will never be happy 1 too plainly fee without me, while my whole heart is devoted to the charming Bab. But though Jhe deferves all my tendernefs I cannot make Conflantia wretched.
Before
[ 8i ]
Before I Saw either of the Mifs Graftons, t looked upon niyfelf, you know, in Some fort engaged to Mifs Lewfon. Nothing indeed about an alliance between us was ever hinted at by me ; but I found that fuch an alliance had been ear-neflly deSired both by her father and mine.—I was free you will fav, as I had given no promife.—I was certainly So; but after a few vifits which I made to Conftantia, viSits unavoidable, on her coming immediately under my protedlion, I found her fo pleafed with my company, fo loth to let me leave her, and fo very eager to engage me to permit her being with me, that I began to entertain thoughts of complying with the wilhes of our fathers. On my purchaSing Elm Park, you, believing that you fhould give me pleafure by fo doing, introduced me to the twm lovely Sifters; and indeed I received lingular pleafure from your introduiSiion. From that introduction, however, I date ail the uneaSinefs v/hich I at prefent endure.
Bab Soon appeared in my eyes the moll defirable woman I had ever feen.—PleaSing in her perfon, lively, fenlible, accompliflied, and good-natured. She charmed me. With her good nature I was particularly delighted, and flie has been improving upon me ever lince.—Had I never known Conftantia I Ihould hope to have rendered myfelf as agreeable to her as Pe appeared to me : but finding that every time I faw Conftantia her afteCtions for me increafed, I felt myfelf not felfifh enough, to prefer my oven happinefs to hefSj efpecially as I had no reafon to flatter myfelf with having made the impreftion upon Mifs Grafton—noc-
withftanding

[ 82 ]
withftanding all her politenefs—which I had donj on Conftantia.*—I could, therefore, only hurl myfelf in complying with Mifs 'Lewfon’s wifhes, by giving her the preference to the woman 1 fhould otherwife have chofen. But fond as tht poor girl was of me—for fhe difcovered her fond nefs by numberlefs little inadvertencies, I coul not think of marrying her direfiUy from a boarding School, without the leaS introdu61:ion into life.
While I was in this Situation, IViifs Grafton b\
»
her extreme good-nature, encouraged me to inform her of the ftate of my affairs with the greateft freedom; and when I had unbofomed myfelf, kindly offered to let Mifs Lewfon be witli kerf as fhe fhould be glad of a young companion to Supply the place of Ad!rs. Dafhwood.—She alfo genteely invited my girl before your marriage, that fhe might have an opportunity of feeing a ceremony fo new to her, and of improving herfelf by the company of the people of falhion who were to be prefent at'it.—You may fuppofe that this proceeding of Bab’s did not make me like her lefs: on the contrary her engaging behaviour, both to:, Conffantia and ^to me, quite won my heart.— But then poor Conftantia’s increafing tendernds for me, which fhe difcovered by every look and gelture, and the melancholy diffufed over her features whenever 1 neglected her, or took notice of her friend, fo touched me, fo excited my pity, that I could not help doing every thing in my power to relieve her diftreffed mind.—MoH gladly did I confent to her acceptance of Mrs.
Dafhwood’s and your kind invitation, not with-
'	cwt
[ 83 ]
out hopes that fhe might fee ether men more agreeable to her than myfelf, and consequently leave me at liberty to follow my own inclination. She has Seen fame who have very much endeavoured to pieafe her; but fhe can hardly bear to hear them named. I have both rallied her, and talked ferioufly to her about her unreasonable antipathies, but to no purpofe.—In Short, her Sighs, her tears, her tender glances frequently diredled to me, her eagernefs to fly to me whenever I appear, her regret at leaving me, tho’ for ever So Short a time, are indubitable proofs of her tender attachment to me ; thofe proofs and the declaration which She made to me when I urged her to admit lord Hillwood’s ad-dreflfes, have rendered it neceffary for me to come to Some resolution about her, as fhe has declared that She would rather be my ConSlantia than a queen.
JuSl at this time my reflections on Bab’s charming behaviour towards fo unformed, though fo amiable a creature, and on her increafing polite-nefs to me, gave me the greatefl: concern, as I could not even attempt to gain her without making the other unhappy; fo intenfe indeed was my concern upon the occaSion, and fo Severe was the conflict in my bofom, that I was really thrown into a fever.—During my fuSterings under the Shocks which that ciforder gave to my confti-tution, I had Sliil more opportunities to fee into the characters of thefe lovely girls. ConSlantia was indeed fo totally oppreSTed by feeing me fo ill, that She fell into tremblings and fainting fits, fo that
the
t 84 ]
the dear adorable Bab had very Soon the foie care of me; and Ihe did, indeed, exert herfelf with ■uncommon fpirit, I may add, tendernefs.—Oh, Dafhwood ! I fometimes flattered myfelf that Ihe difeovered fomething more than mere humanity for the poor fufFering objedl before her, when flie thought nobody obferved her.—She read to me— fhe even fung to me, as if in pity to my pain, and now and then a gentle Sigh efcaped from her; foft bofom.—Nay once I fav/ her weep; yes, I faw tears of compaflTion trinkling down her angelic countenance.—Gracious G—d! what became of me at that intoxicating moment ? I forgot that I had never profefied a paflTion, the concealment of which had half deftroyed me. I forgot that Con-ftantia v/as almofl: expiring with her terrors for me; I forgot every thing but the enchanting inflant when I believed this amiable woman did not behold me with indifference.—Snatching her hand to my .burning lips, I kiffed it with an ardour beyond exprefiion; and yet fhe did not feem angry, but continued her charming folicitude about me. Was not this encouragement fufficient, had I been at liberty to avail myfelf of it ?—I cannot, however, fee Conftantia languifhing, dying and not offer my hand, my heart, to fave her life.—I muff, therefore, give up all thoughts of the dear creature on w'hom I doat, and marry her who doats on me. 1 am a fellow of confummate vanity, you will fay ; but I have flated the cafe very fairly, and with the pen of truth.—As I have fo ftated it, I hope you will be flrongly indu ced to pity

to him the greateft of all villains; and that he

all, they may not be fobad as they appear to me but they certainly have not a favourable alpect.
A night or two after Charbury left us, poor Conflaritia was fo very low fpirited, that my Sifter, to divert her rndancholy, propofed go-ing to Ra-
Mr. Dafhwood was pre-engaged, or fhe would rK>t have gone, I believe, on any account W'ithcut him...
We had' not been there long, when an exceed- j ing fine woman, elegantly drefled, appeared, ac- ‘ companied by another, who Seemed to be an humble dependant, and who led the lovelieft boy f ever beheld.—The pretty child foon caught Lucy’s eyes,, and atf.rafited them in Such a manner, that, after having; mentioned him. Several times to ms

and mifs Lewfon with great admiration,, fhe, at laft Spoke to him, and begged the favour of a. kifs, which was granted with much Seeming pride by her whom I fuppofed to be his mother; while the good-humoured little fellow threw his arms-round Lucy’s neck as fhe ftooped down to him, and looked, valily pleafed at being fo carefled. He w^as indeed' a ftriking figure-. Lucy, after having diftinguiShed him a good deal, while he was fre-quently brought neanher,. apparently to engage her
attention, aftced the woman who had the care of

him, when fhe talked of carrying him, home, whofe child he was

The woman replied, Mr. Dafhwood’s.”
That anfwer ftartled me, I. confefs, though it did not occaSion any alteration in Lucy’s features,, who immediately Said,. ‘‘ Is that, your mama, my dear ?” looking at the charming woman who kept at a diftance, while fhe fpoke to the child..
Yes,”
- [ 91	1
Yes,” Said the little boy.
That reply Seemed to rife no fufpicion in Lucy ; but I was very difSerently afSedted by it.
When Mr. Dafhwood came home in the evening, She told him what a Sweet boy Sne had Seen ; addins that his name was DaShwood, and alkina:
o
him, with the raoft innocent countenance, if he had any Such relation.
He immediately anSwered in the negative, though I Saw him change colour, and be inftantly gave a turn to the conversation.-—The boy is undoubtedly his, my dear; there never was a ftron-ger likeneSs; a fine made little fellow about four or five years old, with juft Such Sparkling and curling hair, and Such a Smiling mouth.—The blooming rogue was quite a roSy cherub: he wore pea-green and Silver huffar-dreSs, with a beaver-hat and feather.—In Short, I thought Lucy v/ould have devoured him, and was forced to call her off, and give her a hint that 1 fancied the woman he was with was not a proper acquaintance for her.

they will, the child is a. perfect angel in every reSpedt I am Sure.”
Now I do verily believe that this woman is onC' of DaSlawood’s former miftrelfes, and that the boy is his child—I Said nothing to Lucy about my conjectures^ but watched my fly brother, and observed

I cannot help faying that though I Shall ex-tremely pity my Sifter, if my fufpicions are wdl grounded,.

I found Die really very ill. My child, my Edward, flew to me with fuch delight painted in his innocent face, that I thought I Should never be able to Suffer him to leave my arms.—The insinuating mother then came, and with a Supplicating look, while tears rolled from her fine eyes, alked me if I could pofSibly thus diftrefs her by my cruel lect.—I had appeared for Some time quite indifferent to her,
I told her that my behaviour to her would depend entirely upon her discretion, of which I had not Scarcely Seen a Single inflance for a considerable time. In Ihort, Ihe humbled herfelf fo much, and fell fo thoroughly in with my humour, that I Spent the the greatefl; part of the day with her : but I will own notwithftanding, that I never felt more Sincere joy than when I returned to my Lucy, who has entirely gained my heart. Never was there a more lovely creature. Her perfon is fufficientlj inviting to charm, without that enchanting foft-nefs of temper, which would conquer the mod obstinate.

While we were taking our coffee, lord Charbury informed us of his intention to return to the Park the next morning, and alk^d my lifter if he fliould carry any meffage for us to Grafton-houfe.
Conftantia changed colour, and feemed extremely reftlefs: I fancied fhe wanted to be be alone with him.—My fifter expedting company I was following her into the drawing room, ‘‘ Are you going to leave us, madam ?—faid he to me, with a conftrained fmile—will you not be fo good as to ftay and hear me promife Mifs Lewfon never to perfuade her any more to receive Lord Hillwood, whofe vifits I had only encouraged in confequence of his repeated intreaties, and becaufe I thought him a very amiable man.”

Any man who had felt the leaft inclination for her, any man of common gallantry; in ftiort, any other man would have kifled her hand in return ; but he did not even prefs it, and he looked, I thought more embarrafled than Ihe did. Bowing refpectfully to me, he left the room.
I am not able to know what to make of this behaviour ; but it is hot, I think, very favourable to poor Conftantia.—-As for me-—I am out of the queftion.

The company going away early, flie complained of the head-ach, and retired to her own room : there fne re-

malned, not chufing to come down to Supper. I •went up to know what was the matter, though I gueffed that fhe was only alFedled with my lordV departure.
I found her, as I expefled, with her Spirits violently agitated. When I urged her to acquaint me with the cauSe of her flutter, fhe replied, but with great relu6fance, that her head was worfe, and that fhe would go to bed.
After having propofed various remedies, but in vain, as fhe refufed to take any thing, I left her w.th Sally. I even thought that fhe wanted ine
though fhe feemed to be not in the leafl dif-pleafed with me. I called in again before I went to bed, and Sally told me that fhe believed llie was afleep.—-I fancied, indeed, I heard her fob, but imagined fhe only fretted about my lord’s going away; I alfo imagined that fhe would be better by herfelf, as fhe might not chuSe to let any bodj fee how much fhe was diftrefTed at his abfence; defiring Sally, therefore, to call me if her ladj was ill, I retired to my own apartment, though as little inclined to reft as Conflantia was.
In the morning Sally tapped at my door, and begged to Speak with me; I bade Molly let her in, and fhe told me that mifs Lewfon was much worfe;
in a high fever, fhe feared.
I rofe immediately, and found her excefllvely difordered; quite delirious indeed, repeating lord Charbury’s name, and calling upon him not to leave her, but to fave her from the miSery fhe
was in.

[ lOI ]
Mifery, my dear Conllantia—Said I—what afflidts you So much? We will fend, and let my lord know how ill you are, as I dare fay he is not yet got to Elm Park : but, in the mean time, you muft tell me what makes you fo very uneafy.”
Oh! replied fhe—he has left me for ever:
C6
I fliall never fee him again.
I Was ftartled, I confefs, at this exclamation, though I looked upon her in the light of a lunatic, and told her to make herfelf compofed; that I believed fhe was millaken.—“ But fuppofing he is gone, my dear, added I, ’tis ftrange that you fhould imagine he will not fee you again.”
Oh'—no—no—cried fhe—he will never be any thing to me : another will have that dear heart, that charming perfon, and I—mull die—with de-fpair.

I was, I own, extremely furpriz-ed at this fpeech.—-I had no doubt with regard to the fenti-ments of the fpeaker; but I thought they were delivered with a calmnefs rarely to be met with in delirious people. I therefore began to fufpeft her of having feigned herfelf worfe than Ihe was, in order to difcover her pallion, which flie would have been afhamed to reveal in any other way : but I
wronged her; poor thing! fhe was not in her fenfes.
The phySician declaring it to be his opinion that fomething lay upon her mind, advifed us to fend for lord Charbury.
Mr. Daftiwood then—for I had informed both him and my filler of her condition, not chuSing to do any thing about her of my own head—Mr,
[D 3]	Dafliwood
X
[ 102 ]
Dafhwood then wrote a line to let him know that mifs Lewfon was dangeroufly ill, and that ftie had called upon him inceffantly.
When the fervant whom he had difpatched with his letter, arrived at Elm Park, he was informed that my lord had not been there for fome time, and could not in two days procure any intelligence about his lordfhip.—My lord, indeed, went down to Windfor with the gentleman at whole houfe he fupped, on the night Conftantia was taken ill.
During cur fruitlels enquiries after him fhe came to her fenfes; but was weak, low, and dejected, and looked as if Something very difagreeable lay on her mind, which fhe did not know how to reveal ; and, without the removal of her uneaSinefs, nothing, the dodtor declared, could be done. Our bufinefs, therefore, was to make her Speak ss freely v/hen in her fenfes, as fhe had done when deprived of them.—This bufinefs I took upon myfelf, and fhe naturally enough turned the conversation upon the very fubjedt on which I wanted her to enlarge, by alking if her guardian knew fhe was ill, and where he was.
After having Suffered her to repeat her enquiries three or four times, I told her that I was fure Lord Charbury was the caufe of her illnefs, though innocently fo.
“ Is he not going to be married ?” faid fhe, colouring like Scarlet; and, hiding, her face with her handkerchief, would have been extremely glad to have retracted what fhe had faid.

“ But why, my dear mifs Lewfon—anfwered I •fhould you fancy he is engaged ? How came that into your head I And who is the lady ?”
Thislaft interrogation proceeded, I am afraid, as much from curiofity as compalTion.
After a Number of fighs- and tears, after a multitude of excufes, fhe confeffed that fhe had loved lord Charbury ever hnce fhe had been under his care, and had flrove as much as fhe could, modell-ly, to exprefs her very great efleem and affedlion for him. “ He has ever, indeed—continued fhe treated me with the higheft regard, but I have never difcovered in him any figns of inclination for me j and he has proved his indifference too plainly by fo earneflly perfuading me to accept of lord
Hillwood,
[	:o4 ]
Hlllwood, whom he encouraged to try to pleafe me. By So doing he gave me So much uneaSinefs that it was not in my power to conceal iS totally from my maid Sally, who, in return for a confidence improperly placed, abruptly told me that fhe fuppofed he wanted to fee me fettled firft, as he was going to be married to a lady in the country, whofe name fhe did not know; but file added, that fhe was Sure of it, becaufe my lord’s man had communicated the news to her.—> That new^s, and my lord’s coldnefs together, have thrown my mind into fo diftradled a ftate, that I cannot poffibly fay when I fhall be reftored to the tranquility which I once enjoyed.”
When I had heard her out, and it was Some
time before fhe had finifhed her confejpon, as fhe received interruptions from fhame and grief, I begged her to compofe herfelf, and promifed to found my lord about this marriage, of which, however, I did not believe a fyllable.—Hardly had fhe earneftly conjured me not to expofe her to him, when I heard of his arrival.
I had now, you will readily allow I fancy, a difficult part to play, efpecially as I was not lefs attached, I will honeftly owm, to lord Charbury than this poor young creature,—I determined to make him fufficiently fenfible, to the utmofl; of

[ i®5 ]
as (he heard he was below', that I was exceedingly
alarmed for her.	*	^
When he entered the room, Ihe held my hand So fa ft, intreating me not to leave her, that, though I had deSigned to flip away, I could not poflibly do fo at firft. Fortunately for me, I am not, I dare fay, lufpetted by her of having fentiments Similar to her own.
At the entrance of his lordfhip, a fmile of fatisfatlion rofe in his face at the Sight of me, and he made a little compliment for my care of mifs Lewfon.
When he advanced towards the bed-flde, I quitted my chair, forcibly drawing my hand from Conftantia to give him room to fit by her.
■He Seized both my hands, preflTed them gently, and would have replaced me; but I haftily broke from him, and left the chamber.
In a Short time he came down to the parlour in which I waited.—With a ferious air I immediately afked him how he had found her.
“ Very ill—faid he—but I am greatly indebted to you, mifs Grafton, for your exceeding kind attention to her; an attention—continued he, with a figh—never to be repaid, I fear, either by her or by me.”
Summoning up at once all my fortitude, I replied, ‘‘By your affedfionate attentions alone, my lord, can this poor girl be reftored.—She loves you, my lord; loves you extremely; and the fear of not feeing you equally attached to her, ftrengthened by a report of to be married to a
a report lady in the
your going country, has thrown

[ io6 ]
thrown her into this melancholy fituation, in which nothing but a return of tendernefs equal to that fhe feels for you, will adminifter relief to her.-—You cannot refufe ~your tendernefs, I think, when you refle<^ upon the agreeablenefs of her perfon, the gentlenefs of her manners, and the virtues of her heart; to fay nothing of what Ihe endured before her delicacy would permit her to divulge the fecret which I prefled her, mofl: earneftly, to difclofe.
Here I flopped, waiting to fee what effect my Speech had on him, as well as to relieve myfelf; for I really was fo pained by my own feelings, and felt fo deeply for the charnrSing fellow to whom I had been Speaking, that I was hardly in a condition to articulate another Syllable.
Lifting up his hands and eyes, he faid, foftly,
What will become of me!” Then turning to me, with a Sorrow painted in his countenance, which pierced my heart, “ How, madam! is it poflible that mifs Lewfon’s recovery can depend upon me?—or that my marriage could fo much difquiet her ?—But how came fhe to liflen to fuch a falsehood ?—I never yet addreffed any woman .(Sighing).
“ Make your firfl addrefies then to this dear girl, my lord—faid I, recovering my Speech with an aflonifhing facility-—You cannot be infenfible to youth, beauty, and innocence, fo Sweetly combined; to a heart which is almofl broke on your account, and which will make you happier than any other woman’s, becaufe its gratitude will be equal to its love.”

room.

But why then does he liill Sigh ? Why fit with folded arms, and fpend hours and hours away when he might be with her ?—Poffibly, indeed, the llownefs of her recovery, contrary to his wifhes, may be the caufe of his dejection.—Perhaps he may have feveral affairs to fettle before his marriage, which require his prefence at home : yet, I think, he need not be under any apprehenfion about her health; the eafe whjch he has given to her mind will, in all probability, co-operating with her youth, foon reftore it.—I may add too his extreme affiduity ; for though he does not Spend a great deal of time in her company, he is good-natured and obliging to her, in the higheft degree, whenever he is with her, and is uncommonly tender in his whole-behaviour. He flies to give her her cloak when Ihe is going into the garden; offers his arm to Support her; makes her fit down when She has walked but a tittle way, left fhe Should be fatigued ; and if there is no back to the garden-feat, which is Sometimes the cafe, obliges her to lean upon him to reft her; and when he goes out to take an airing with her, lifts her in and out of the coach. He mufl certainly make the tendereft of all hufbands.—She is fond of him to extravagance, repays all his af-fedtionate afliduities by the moft grateful endeavours to pleaSe.—Yet, notwithftanding all this, there is Something in his behaviour which I cannot define, nor indeed comprehend.

Imagine my diftrefs when Hopkins told me at his return, that Mifs Bellers, who was very well, refufed to give any account of her fon; and that he had made ufc of every artifice in his power to procure intelligence about him, but to no pur-pofe.
Heartily vexed at this information, I fent him, back again dire6lly with a note to Die, wherein I adually intreated her in the moft fubmiffive terras to let me know where the child Was, and how he did.—In vain—fhe peremptorily refufed to mention a word concerning him : Ihe would not even condefcend to write a line in anfwer to me.
Alarmed beyond expreflion at this unaccountable behaviour, I hurried to town, and in perfon begged, conjured her only to tell me where my boy was.

Horrid insinuation!—I told her that fo far from being alhamedof him^ I gloried in him, and would when he was at a proper age, raife him to a ftaticn in which no perfon need 'fcruple to acknowledge him for his child.

“ Now he is your dearell boy—^aid Ihe—but when you have got another, ycu will foon forget him.—No, no, Dalhwood, you can never love the child long, as you have loft all tendsrnefs for his miserable mother.”
“ How unjuftly you upbraid me—replied L— Have I not done every thing within the reach of my abilities to convince you of my regard for you ?”
Nc—faid Ihe, warmly—You have, on the contrary, done every thing which would, you know, give me thegreateft uneafinefs : you pretended, at firft, that you married this woman for convenience, and promised you never would look upon her in any other light: but you have bafely deceived me; you are grown quite fond of her ; ycu know you

Seeing her beginning to rave, and knowing that the gentlefl words would be thrown away upon her in her frantic fits, I left her to herfelf; nor did fhe attempt to detain me.—However, before I quitted the houfe, I clofely interrogated the fer-vants about my boy : but they either could not, or would not give me a fatisfadtory anfwer. I could only learn from them that fhe took him out one day in a chair with her, which fhe ordered to the Park; that fhe came home without him, and that he had not been feen or heard of Since.
You cannot conceive, Moflyn, how this news difturbed me.—I went down in the evening to my wife, but was fo reftlefs and unhappy, that I could not flay at Richmond. I therefore hurried back to Die’s again the next morning. I endeavoured to coax and flatter her into a good humour with me, hoping fhe would then be off her guard, and that I fhould find out what fhe had done with the child : but the artful creature was too cunning for me.—She Seemed pleafed with my careffes; yet whenever I mentioned my boy, fhe inftantly began to talk of foraething elfe.

Mifs Grafton to Mifs Blondel.
Grafton-Houfe»
Have not been right well Since I came here,, and the continued buftle we have been in has not made me better.—I kept my room when Lucy and Dalhwmod left us, to get rid of Afh ; but it is impoflible to get rid of him. — L want--ed, however, chiefly to avoid going to fee Con--ftantia—Lady Charbury I Ihould now fay; and as I pleaded illnefs, my lord—I mean my lady-—Sent twice a day to know how I did. Once, my lord called himfelf; but I did not fee him. Condantia I thought would have flown to her Sick friend: but how fleeting is friendfhip, efpecially the friend-Ihip of women.—Yet let me not wrong my Con--ftantia by this afperfion; (he cannot, indeed, be alFedted by it, becaufe fhe does not delerve it: nor can I fuppofe that lady Charbury has forgot Bab Grafton, or that fhe flays away either from pride or pundtilio; but I believe fhe is fo intoxicated with her happinefs, that fhe thinks of no living creature in the world, except her Charbury.
Having at lafl recovered my fpirits a little, I re-folved to make my vifits in form, and accordingly dreflfed myfelf, and went.without fending. They were both at home. My lord flew to lead me in, and my lady was ready to devour me. My lord faid but little; his-eyes,. however, talked . a good deal: they looked full of a charming languor, which I drove mtXo fee.—I could not get away till I had
L3
promifed
[ 142 ]
promifed them—I was engaged for the firll three or four days they named, finding I would not fix upon one myfelf j but I could not be engaged for ever.
My lord led me back to the chariot. He fighed,' I thought, when he left me; but i endeavoured not to hear his Siarhs.
VShen the day appointed came 1 fent a card to let them know that I was not well enough to keep my engagement, and my card contained half the truth. In the evening they both came to me. The fervant told them that I was juft gone into the garden, for a- little air.—The day had been uncommonly warm; I had paffed the preceding night without much reft; and the ftillnefs of the evening had thrown me into a kind of flumber in the ruftic temple, touch me.
I ftarted, on feeling Somebody
Opening my eyes, I faw lord Char-bury ftanding by me.—Imagine my furprize and confufion. He feemed to be embarrafled, and made an apology for his appearance, by faying, “ Neither Conftantia nor I could be eafy without coming to enquire after you.”-—He then ftam-mered out Something, which I did not underftand. He looked, I thought, charmingly graceful, though rather melancholy.
As we went towards the houfe, he offered me his arm to Support me: you may be fure I did not accept of it.
Lady Charbury ran to meet me, and exprelfed much concern at my indifpofition, declaring, however, that She was glad I was able to go out.— Though I was, indeed, not fit to be feen, not having
left
[ H3 ]
left my room for the whole day till then.—But what Signifies drefs ?—^I have done with it.
They could not make me, with all their importunities, fix upon another day.—I pleaded want of health, and laid I would wait on them as Soon I was well.—'By perfeverance I got rid of them at laft. —Lady Charbury feems to be—fhe muji be the happieft of women.—But why is not he as happy ? —She looked exceflively pretty; and when he went to put her into the coach, fhe almofl: jumped into his arms, while he looked upon her—as indeed he ought to have looked—with a fmile of fa-tisfadlion.—To do the difcreet thing, I muft, I fancy, keep out of my lord’s way—I mean on my own account.—Afh, I believe, thinks with me— though he fays nothing which can juftify my being offended with him.—Adlually I wifh that I was heartily in love with him.
LETTER XLII.
Lord Charbury to-Mr. Dash wo or?.
O U defired me to let you- know as foon as I became reconciled to matrimony, having once been, you candidly confefled, as averfe to it yourfelf as I was; that is> averfe to an alliance with the lady with whom you are now bleft—repeat your own words.—As to the ftate itfelf, I always preferred it to any other; but then I had hoped never to have been conftrained.—»Had I married the woman of my heart, Dalhwood,.! fhould be at this moment as bleft you are.--1 have the fatisfac-
tion,
[ H4 ]
tion, however, to tell you, that you did not fpeak too haftily when you Said that I could not well be wretched with So amiable a young creature as Conftantia. Amiable fhe certainly is in a high degree ; and had I never converfed with mifs Grafton, I fhould have been contented, I believe,
t	-I	^
with Conftantia : but without ever feeling that ardent pafllon, with the pains and pleafures of which I am too well acquainted.—Yet is my wife young and handfome enough for any man; good-natured, complying, and fond of me to an excefs; as a mere woman (he has charms fufficient to excite the warmeft admiration, and to raife the paflion of love in a bofom far lefs amorous than mine : but I feel none of thofe delicious fenfations, none of thofe inexpreflible tranfports, which inftantaneoufly throw my breaft into a fluttering ftate whenever I behold mifs Grafton.—-What then became of me the other day, when I accidentally touched her.
** And how happened it that you never touched her before?”—Methinks I hear you fay.
Why, to tell truth, my friend, 1 have a thou-fand times taken her Soft, white hand in mine; nay I have kified her, but never with the circum-ftances which I am going to relate, were my pref-fures of any kind attended.
You muft know ever Since I have been married, I have endeavoured to avoid the Sight of this enchanting Bab as much as poflible; being determined to do the ftricteft juftice to my wife, as well as to hinder my Self from Sighing after what I was never likely to obtain.—Mifs Grafton, as if
confcious of her own adorable attractions, and
fearful
t >45 ]
fearful of increafing the tormenting flame which at this inftant devours me, keeps herfelf at the greateft (Jiftance.-—However, as flie is the friend of my wife, the frequent exhibitions of her beauties before my eyes in a familiar way, cannot but make | fotne impreffion upon me, as I am not one of your phlegmatic fellows, dead to female attradHons, and deftitute of fenSibility.—I mean, indeed, toa£b with honour, but I cannot pretend to fay how far I may be able to reSifl: opportunity.—-Happily I have adted hitherto with honour j but I have been tried, Dafhwood.—My trial, I may add, has been a fiery one.
The indifpofltion of mifs Grafton, which prevented her from coming to us as we expe^ed, gave me fo much anxiety, that I could not reft till I knew how (he did; or, at leaft,. till L heard a more particular account of her.—I therefore pro-pofed to my wife to call at Grafton-houfe on the evening of the day ftie was to- have Spent with us.
On being told that fhe was in the garden, I ran thither, eagerly wifhing to fee how She really was with my own eyes; though 1 was ftrongly encouraged to hope that ftie was better, as flie had quitted her chamber.
With my heart exceedingly agitated I entered the ruftic temple, Conftantia having ftaid in the parlour to alk Mrs. Ford Some particulars about her friend’s health.
The firft objedt which ftruck me was the dear, lovely Bab herfelf, reclined on one of the fophas, alleep: her head refting upon her arm, and her fine bright hair hanging carelefly over her fnowy forehead. Her cheeks were in the moft beautiful
glow
[ H6 ]
glow to be conceived; I never Saw her look half fo handfome. I flopped at the fight of her in fo inviting an attitude, and had not power to leave the
place, though I was afraid even of breathing, left I fhould difturb her.
While I flood thus loft in pleafure, gazing ardently on her, and utterly incapable of going either backwards or forwards, a large garden-fly came in at the window, and was juft going to fettle on the charming cheek which I had fo much admired.
Alarmed left the monftrous fly ftiould hurt, or only frighten her, I made an effort to drive it away, and in fo doing juft touched the dear face which I
had endeavoured to preferve uninjured.—-ivly touch waked her: but happily, from her behaviour, I had no reafon to believe that She knew fhe had been difturben by me; and I declare I had not prefence of mind enough to tell her on what account fhe had been awaked.—Tranfported as I was at the fight of her, however, I was alfo fearful of having too much fluttered her, and felt myfelf therefore more difconcerted than I had ever been in my life. She too, charming creature, appeared in confufion; but her confufion increafed her natural lovelinefs. Yet, foon recovering, fhe afked me, with her ac-cuftomed vivacity, where lady Charbury was, and propofed going to meet her.-As 1 faw her look
fatigued, I preffed her to accept of my arm.------
She declined it, but with a fraile which even made amends for her refufal.
My Conftantia met her amiable friend, vyith a concern for the news about her illnefs, and a joy to find her better than fhe expedited to fee her,
which

I
[ 147 ]
which pleafed me extremely; and I kiffed her as foon as I got her in the coach, for the efteem and affection foe had discovered for her dear mifs Grafton; wkcm I mufl: ever adore, though this pretty little creature gives me as much pleafure as Jhe can in her way, and is a very good girl.—Indeed, I don’t believe any other in the world would have Succeeded half fo well. ’Tis certainly iinpoffible for a man, not entirely divefted of humanity, to be always infenfible to the carelfes of a fine young girl, who Spends every hour in her life in accommodating herlelf to his tafte.—W hen I am difpofed to be kind, with what tendernefs does file foew the exceflive fatisfadtion which my behaviour gives her ! and when I am in a humour to be alone, I need only fay, ‘‘ Do, my dear Conftan-tia, leave me to my book.” Away foe trips, without being in the lead embarrafled, but returns and peeps in upon me now and then, without Speaking, unlefs I call her:, foe then flies into my arms with as much delight, as if foe had never been difmiflTed from them; fure indeed of being rewarded for her complaifance with a thoufand endearments.
Thus you fee I am neither happy nor unhappy ;
and yet I am both.---How paradoxical am I}—
However, while Bab remains unmarried I can make myfeif tolerably eafy; and yet, how mean, how felfifo is it to wifo that foe foould pafs her youth, the feafon for love, without tailing any of its pleafures, becaufe foe mull not enjoy them with me.—I hate myfeif for being fo abfurd; though I am convinced, from my being utterly unable to Ilifle fuch a wifo, how extremely I am,
notwith-

LETTER XLIII.
The Honourable Edward Dashwood to Sir

AM Hill moll unhappy, becaufe I can get no intelligence about my boy. I cannot learn whither this woman has fent him.—Were it not for my Lucy I Ihould aftually’' run diftraQ:ed.—I am, indeed, half out of my fenfes already.—I have been very much disordered with a feverilh complaint, occafioned, I believe, by the agitation of my mind; but it has ferved to make me difcover new perfe^ions in my charming wife, new tendernefs in every word and aftion.—How have I been indulged! with what extreme affedlion did Ihe hang over me, while I was hardly able to lift my head from my pillow! with what anxious care did Ihe endeavour to foothe my pain, to quiet my reftleflhefs, and to lull me to Ileep upon her dear Soft bofom!—Never, furely, was a man fo idolized by a woman.—Die loved me, I believe, exceedingly ; but then Ihe flew to excite and return my paflTion with an ardour equal to my own.—This dear angel feems to have no defires to gratify; no will on earth but mine: Ihe is quite adorable; and could I but recover my boy, I fwear foiemnly I

Were I to acquaint you with the numberlefs attentions of my dearelt girl, I Ihould fill a dozen Iheets.—She enquires into the caufe of my melancholy with a tender timidity, as if fearful of giving -offence; and when I put her off, really afhamed to relate my follies, turns away from me, filently weeping.—-Oh! God! how ray heart is torn!—I run after, catch her to my bofom, and kifs away her tears. Her love is a remedy for everything: but as I feel my Self unr deferving of it, my remorfe is almofl: infupport-able.
LETTER XLIV.
From the fame to the fame.
HIS creature’s infolence will be hardly credited by you.—She has fent her ’woman after me even into the very prefenc.e of my wife.—-S’death ! her behaviour is not to be endured.
I had not been well, I told you.—Finding myfelf extremely low, but fufficiently recovered to leave my chamber, I walked with my Lucy in the garden. I walked with her till I was quite fatigued. —I then threw myfelf on a feat by her, refting my head on her lap.—Being more difordered in my mind than my body, I begged my dearefl: girl to fing and charm away my pain.—She inftantly complied, and with the fweetefl: of all voices, rendered ftill more harmonious by the tender com-palTion which file felt for me, wrapped my foul in elyfium.
VoL. II.	M	While
[	150 ]
While I was in this enraptured Hate, who fhould make her appearance before me but Ellis. Never was furprize, confuSion, and anger, equal to mine; and they all co-operated at once to render me incapable of expreiling my fenfations on the very un-expe6ted occaSion. Anger, however, prevailing, gave me ftrength enough to recollect myfelf.—. Starting up from my wife’s lap, without even con-defcending to Speak to Ellis, I called aloud for Hopkins.
Hopkins inftantly appearing, I alked him how he dared to fend any perfbn into the garden, without firft enquiring whether I chofe to be feen; and with all the refolution I could mufter up, added, Whatever that perfon wants, take her into the houfe, and let her XtWyou her bufinefs.”
The manner in which I fpoke was Sufficient to let Ellis fee that I would be obeyed.—She therefore, went with Hopkins, having firft, however, looked very earneftly both at me and my wife, to whom I immediately complained of the impertinence of Hopkins; and in order to cruffi fufpicions, which file might very rationally entertain, faid, “ This woman, I luppofe, is foraebody with whom he is connebled, and I will go and enquire into the affair.”
What a fcandalous evafion!—How defpicably we a6l when we endeavour to make our Servants appear guilty of faults which we have ourfelves committed!—How does one folly draw us into another!
I Scarce knew how Lucy took what I faid to her: I could not ftay to obferve her behaviour,
Flurrying
[ HI ]
Hurrying into the houfe, I aflced Ellis w’hat Ihe meant by coming to me in that manner.
The deceitful huffey replied, “ that her miftrefs had exprefly commanded her to fee me wherever I was; and to tell me that if I did not viSit her as ufual, (he would come herfelf, and know the rea-fon of my abfence.”
“ The reafon—faid I—Hie well knows already : had Ihe not kept me in ignorance about the child, file would have had no room to complain.”
“ MaSer is at home. Sir—faid Ellis-—my lady bid me tell you.”
“ Do y ou then immediately go to her, and never let me fee you here again upon any account whatever.”
Flinging from her when I had uttered thefe words, I retired to my clofet to conSider what I Ihould fay to my Lucy; but I could not think of abetter excufe than I had made before; an excufe which 1 was aStually afhamed to repeat,, and therefore faid nothing at all.
The dear girl, who is, I believe, as unfufpect-ing as fhe is lovely, not once expreffed the ilightefl curiofity about Ellis, though her horrid appearance prevented me from cloSing my eyes all night.
The next morning I went to Die; fully intending to chide her very feverely for her imprudence, her inlolence indeed ; but Hie began firft ; and after having vented a torrent of abufe, the repetition of which would fully my paper, attually curfed my wife, Ned, herfelf, every thing; and with the bittereft execrations wifhed unnumbered evils on my head, only becaufe Lhad laid it in the Soft
M 2	lap
L H2 I
lap of my angel, my Lucy.—What infernal beings do the mod beautiful ones in the creation make themfelves,, w'hen they give way to their anger and refentment !—In vain did I tell her that I had been much indifpofed,. that I was then very ill and that the anxiety 1 felt about my boy, had made me wifh to lay my head any where for a little reft.

Undoubtedly--«faid flie—^I wonder you did not lay it in her deteftable bofom.—rBut this ridiculous excufe won’t go down with me ; you know yourfelf it is a villainous one: you know you love this woman, ay, doat upon her as you once did upon me; and it was your love for her alone that made you fo eager to marry; though you framed fo poor,, fo flimfy an apology for your conduQ about your want of money.”
I pofitively affured her that my apology was the truth; and that I fhould be in the greatefl: want of money again, did fhe not fet fome bounds to her expences.—Your extravagance
“ Aye—replied fhe-to be fure.—H—11 Seize you though, for laying the caufe of my mifery on me, when I have no hand in it.—Take back all that you have given me —continued fhe, putting her hand in her pocket, and throwing a purie at me—here, take back your pidture too ; it is not like you ; it is not half fo handfome as that which you gave your wife : but were it ten times more lovely than it is,. I would fcorn to keep the copy, without being poflefled of the original.—Nc—I will have all or none.— There, Sir, (throwing it upon the ground, and
flanaping
it is all my extravagance
r 153 I
ftamping on it)—^there—there—thus would I Serve you and your wench, for flie is nothing better: your Vows, your love, your perfon, are all mine, though you have unjuftly and cruelly given them to another : but by every thing that’s dear to me, I fwear you Ihall never enjoy that peace of mind of which you have deprived me, nor your idol neither—I will positively deftroy her; Since I find that you can only be hurt by her deftrudtion. I’ll make you both feel worfe pangs than thofe of flighted love, if worfe pangs can poflibly be endured.’^’
A burfl: of tears gave here a momentary flop to her fury, and afforded me time to refledf upon the tnoft likely means to footh her: for when fhe is in thefe raging fits, there is no contending with them. •—Opposition only adds violence to the florm.
At lafl: it fubfided.—I then, having yielded to it the more readily, as I earneftly longed to fee my boy, who had not yet appeared, catched up my pitlure, the glafs of which was broke in a thou-fand pieces; and with a look calculated, I thought, to touch her, faid, “ And is it thus. Die, you treat the refemblance of your once-loved Dafhwood; indeed him—himfelf, by your cruelty, in depriving him of the fight of his dear child I-—
“ Oh! villain—diffembling villain!—:iepliedfile —can you again put on all that bewitching foftnefs,, which firft Seduced my too credulous heart, and . made me as eager to adore as to be adored ?

“ You ftiall, I fwear-—‘replied I, taking her in my arms—you fhall find all. your happiuefs, if you will be but moderate and. difcreet, as I have often
told you.”
“ And Ihall I again lifien to you, you charming falfe one ?”—(half Softened)—
“ Let me but fee our boy, my Die—(forcing myfelf to embrace her)-—and you Ihall be Satisfied with me ; upon my life you, Ihall.”
** Yes—^jull when you are not iu humour with your wife, you will, 1 fuppoSe, come and fool away an hour with me, and then go and loll out the reft of the happy day in her lap.—Oh ! the very idea is not to be Supported, DaShwood; I will have you all, or none ! ”

Said I
But you give me no encouragement— to be conftant; you will not let me have my Ned. —The fight of that pretty fellow would bind me to you more firmly than any thing upon earth could do.”
‘‘ And So I mufl be obliged to that chit, after all, for your love, and not to any thing in myfelf; though I am Hill allowed by all the men to be as handSome as ever.”
“ I Ihall allow you to be as handforae, aye handSomer, than ever, if you will produce my boy: as the fight of him, and my tenderneSs together, would brighten your features and complexion beyond expreffion.—Do, my dear Diana,” added I, Hill wheedling her.
She then laid her head languilhingly on my fhoulder, and bade Ellis fetch the boy.
Never

Never certainly was any transport equal to mine. .—At the appearance of the dear little rogue, I almoft threw his mother down in advancing to meet him, as he ran into my arms.—Nobody who has not been a. father, Moftyn, can tell what a father feels upon fneh occallons. I. thought I fliould never be able to let him go from me. When-1 went to Set him down the Sweet child climbed up in my lap, and hung round my neck, fo that his mother was abfolutely excluded from any Share in my carefles; though I Saw pleafure dance in .the cunning gipfy ’s eyes at my fond parental behaviour.

LETTER XL VIII.
\
Lord Charbury to Mr. Dashwood.
Don’t remember ever to have felt my mind in a more agitated Hate than it has been in during tire lafl: fortnight. Lady Charbury has been very ill. At the beginning of her diforder fhe found fo Arcing a deSire to fend for mifs Grafton, that flie had written a card for that purpofe, and was actually going to difpatch it, when I came in and faw it in her handi—As fhe had no -doubts concerning my entire approbatibri, fhe only JufHhewed
her card to me, adding, that fhe was greatly indif-pofed, and wifhing earneftly to have the pleafure of Bab’s company, had preffed her fo much to come, that fhe fully expedited no denial.
I felt an uneafinefs at this information, which I cannot defcribe. As J fat for Some time looking on the card which I held in my hand without fpeaking, fhe began to difcover that its contents were not at .all agreeable to me.
“ Sure—cried fhe, with a languifhing tone— my dear lord, you cannot have any diflike to my amiable mifs Grafton’s company ?”
This queftion made me colour—^yet I affedted to be difpleafed, and endeavoured to reafon Con-Aantia out of her fancy, telling her that I thought fhe would pay her friend a greater compliment by inviting her when fhe was well, and better able to entertain her.
« I will
[ ]
I will gladly do every thing in my power to give mifs Grafton pleafure when I am well : but I very much wifh to fee her now, becaufe fhe is fo chearful, and fays fo many kind things.—You know, my lord, how much good fhe did you when you was fick.”
I felt rayfelf touched a fecond time on the re-collefhon of Bab’s charming officioufnefs about me, which made me think it highly improper to truft myfelf with her fo near me again. I, therefore, began to convince lady Charbury of the impropriety of deSiring her friend’s company jufl now, afluring her that I would fupply her place, and do whatever I could to make her eafy.”
A few tender carefles put her by for the prefenti but as her diforder increafed, and as her Spirits became more and more depreffed, fhe took it into her head that fhe Ihould never recover.—She
grew, indeed, fo extremely unhappy for want of the fight of her friend, that I could not any longer refufe, though in doing fo 1 Should a<9: directly in oppofition to my judgment, to invite her.—I con-fented to write even a iecond card, dictated by Conftantia : but I took care alfo to avoid it in fuch a manner that mifs Grafton might only think we defired her company for a Single day.—She
even
underftood me Still better; for fhe made but a viflt of a couple of hours, pleading Sir Robert’s bad (late of health. I only received her, and led her back to her carriage. I would not interrupt her viflt to lady Charbury.
How lovely did fhe look ! how amiable was her behaviour! how joyfully Should I have Supplied VoL. II.	N	Conftantia’s
[ ]
Conftantia’s place when fhe threw her arms round her charming neck, and prefled her to her bofom in the warmth of friendfliip!—I even loved lady Charbury while I envied her, better than at any other time, for her efteem, for her fondnefs for this dear Bab. Glad was I, however, to fee her depart, tho’ I could have gazed on her for ever.
Luckily Conftantia grew better, and luckily I was faved from being too near the woman on whom I cannot help doating, though I am convinced that I ought never to think of her again.--Be thankful Dafhwood, that you in a marriage, not of your own feeking, find your happinefs only in Xhtarms of your wife.
LETTER XLIX.
Mifs Grafton to Mifs Blondel.
Am going, ray dear Cecilia, to confent to a meafure, with which I have often thought, efpe-cially of late, that I never fhould be able to comply.—-I have brought myfelf to think more favourably of Afh, and to wilh I had a heart to give him.
•Will you not infer from this declaration that I lhall certainly give him my hand?—-To tell you the truth, I found my head running too much upon Charbury for fome time even after he was married, and irrecoverably loft to me; and therefore, out of prudence, deprived myfelf, in a great meafure, of the innocent pleafure I fhould have enjoyed
[	1^3	]
joyed in feeing Conftantia, becaufe I would not put myfelf in his way.
Conftantia, however, beirkg taken ill, would not be latisfied, unlefs I came to fee her. Accordingly a card was brought to me, written by my lord. You cannot conceive how the Sight of the well known hand fluttered my foolilh fpirits, and made me fenfible how very unfit I was to pay fuch a •vifit. Indeed I at firfl: hefitated about it, and,' al-moft determined to frame lome excufe.
however, that if I himfelf to fetch me
Fearing,
refufed, my lord might come I went.
He met me at the door with fuch looks of delight, and declared his gratitude to me in fuch ftrong terms for my regard for lady Charbury, while he led me to her chamber, that I did not, I doubt, behave with the referve with which I had intended to appear.—Not that 1 would have you imagine I difcovered any improper emotions: but I will honeftly own I fcarce knew how to conceal the fatisfaftion I felt at the fight of him. He looked, 1 thought, more amiable than ever, and there was an engaging foftnefs in his manners,, which touched me extremely. He left me, however, alone with my lady, who told me Ihe felt herfelf revived at my prefence, and complained,, poor, innocent, unfufpe£ling girl, of my negledling her very much fince her marriage.
‘‘ As you are fo happy with the man of your choice—faid I—you cannot, I think, want the company of a third perfon.”
“ I am, indeed, my dear mifs Grafton—replied (he—the happieft of women.?—My lord treats me
N 2'.	with
[	1^4	]
with a tendernefs which far exceeds my expeSa-tions; but do you know—added fhe, with a fmile ■that I want the company cf fo agreeable a friend as you are, who have been long acquainted with every movement of my heart, in order to talk about my lord to you, and to tell you the thoufand
In re
kind things he does to make me happy, turn, my dear, 1 will praife you as much to him,”
T hat will never do, thought I.
After having made her a little compliment upon
her partiality in my favour, I faid, “ My father’s
ill Hate of health prevents me from coming to you
as often as I wifli to fee you; but my efteem and
affedion for you are as warm and as Sincere as ever.”
She threw her arms round my neck to thank me. At that moment my lord entered the room. I broke from her, and looked very filly, I believe, as 1 Saw an expreiTion in his eyes, which ought not to have been in them, and which my appearance had occasioned.—He accompanied me to the chaife with emotions which he ftrove to ftifle, but could not fupprefs; his hand trembled exceedingly, and he quitted me with a figh which feemed to come from the bottom of a heart in the moft agitated condition.
I can’t fay that I felt myfelf right the who-le day afterwards; and as Afh was very importunate in the evening, I almoft thought it would be better to take Jiitn to drive the other more effedlually out of my head. However I did not acquaint him with my fentiments you may be fure. I only treated him with more complaifance than ofusl,
by
I >65 ]
by making no oppofition to his repeated intreaties for my confent to the completion of his wifhes. I fat, indeed, half ftupid, and did not much attend to any thing: but when I retired to my apartment, I began to conSider that people not entirely dif-agreeable to each other might be happy in the marriage ftate, and that a tender inclination on each fide was by no means abfolutely necelTary. Has not this affertion been llrongly enforced by one who was certainly as great a mailer of the human heart as ever exilled ?—-And does not the union between lord and lady Charbury give Ilrength to it ?—Lord Charbury was not, I have reafon to believe, in the Ilighteft degree in love with mifs Lewfon, and yet you fee he behaves with a tendernefs Sufficient to make her contented with it.—Why then cannot I bring myfelf to treat Afh in the manner agreeable to his wilhes ?•« Poffibly his paffion for me may,, in time, kindle a paflion in my bofom for him:, at leall, it is worth while to try. As all. men are equally indifferent to me, I think I ought to determine in favour of the. man who has, according to all appearance. Suffered the moll for me.
You are now well acquainted with my cafe. Shall I take him, my Cecilia ?—Anfwer this important quellion for me. I- a^ually fear that I, h^ve not fortitude enough to enable me to determine for myfelf.*—Be Speedy in. your reply; for you know,

A few days ago I received the following letter by the Penny-port.
«
Mrs. Ash to Mifs Grafton.
Madam,
I Am reduced to the cruel neceflity of divulging a Secret, which muft leflen the charadler of the man whom I have long truly loved : yet it is not with the leart hope of recalling him to myfelf; nor do I expedl to regain a heart, to which I once flattered myfelf I had feveral pretenfions. Our hands, however, madam, have been legally united.—Jurtice obliges me to give you this important information.—I was married at Oxford to
William
I
fhould never, indeed, have discovered my marriage without my hufband’s permiffion, though I have indisputable proofs of it in my porteffion, had I not heard of his attachment to you. By concealing it any longer, eSpecially from you, I fhould behave in a very criminal manner.
I am. Madam,
Your humble Servant,
A. Ash.
The above letter aftonifhed me, I confeSs, exceedingly, becaufe I had all the reafon in the world to believe that Afh was a man of chara6ter.^—At firrt, indeed, I was inclined to imagine that Some
meddling
[ I'/I ]
meddling perfon had endeavoured to make a difference between us, by accufing'him of a piece of villainy of a very atrocious nature ; and as I
thought it incumbent on me not to condemn him unheard, I gave him the letter.—I gave it him, and watched every movement of his features, defiring his perufal of it.
He read it with great perturbation; he turned pale, and trembled to Such a degree, that the letter fell from his hand to the floor.
As foon as he could recover himfelf a little, he faid, with a faultering voice, “ The charge is but too true, madam; I am undone for ever; yet I am the more difquieted, becaufe I muft have appeared to you in the mofl: Scandalous light; I mull: have appeared to you as the bafeft deceiver. But I fwear by every thing mofl; facred, that I never had the leafl defign to deceive you; and if you will but permit me to relate my unfortunate flory, you may thiiik me entitled to your pity, though nothing
more.

“ Soon after my firfl going to Oxford, I was, in my rambles about the country, flruck with the uncommon beauty of a young girl not many miles from the univerfity.—She was the daughter of a farmer; but fhe was as much Superior to the other females in the village by her education as by her perfon.—Her perfon charmed my eyes, her inno-
mndefly, and affection for me won my -I feixed every opportunity of feeing Nancy Trevor, and I thought of her too much, when abfent from her, to enjoy any kind of fatisfa6fion. —I mufl alfo, though to my fliame, confefs, that

heart.
as
[	172	]
as I believed, from the great difference in our Situations, a legal union between us would be impracticable, I drove by every art I was mafter of to induce her to confent to my wifhes without marriage, offering her a handfome allowance for the prefent, and promising to make a large Settlement on her when I came of age.—-She refufed every thing of that kind, however, with a firmnefs which gave me the greateft difquietude, as I really was at that time extremely fond of her.—My fondnefs being increased by her refiftance, became at length too violent to be endured ; fo that I found myfelf drongly impelled, by a paflion which I could not poflibly conquer, to marry her privately, as I knew that ray father would never approve of fuch a ftep. So pleafing was her perfon, fo winning were her manners, I thought myfelf for Some time the hap-piell of men, and I never left her but with'the greateft regret.—My frequent vifits to London gave considerable interruptions to my happinefs with her; but when I reflected upon my clandef-tine proceeding, fully affured that I never could prudently attempt to own her during my father’s life, I was abfolutely diftreffed; and I confefs I began to repent of what I had done : yet, whenever I returned to Nancy, her beauty and her love fully reconciled me to my Situation.—The laft time I was at Oxford I found her father very ill, and a relation come from Ireland, who propofed to to take her back with him to his mother and Sifter, on her father’s death, till his affairs would permit him to return, and fettle here. For a long time flie

afterwards I was pierced with the fincerell Sorrow by the receipt of a letter from that relation, who informed me of her being drowned on going afhore. —However I became in a little while reconciled to the lofs of her, by reflecting upon the ill confe-quences with which fuch a marriage with fuch a perfon might have been attended.—From that moment I looked upon my Self as entirely at liberty to addrefs whomfoever I liked beft.*—On my father’s dying a Short time afterwards I fet out to make the tour of Europe.—I ftaid in France and in Italy longer than I had intended; but neither abroad^ nor at my return, did I fee any woman whom I could love ferioufly.—You were the firft, mifs Grafton, who made an impreflion upon me; and though I met with repeated refufals from you, I could not bring myfelf to withdraw my addrelfes, and to fix upon one more difpofed to be kind.— Imagine then how Sincerely I was transported when you lb condefcendingly permitted me to hope.—Yet I ftrove to reftrain my tranfports, left I fhould offend the only woman in the world

There is no defcribing, my dear, what I felt from the time of receiving Mrs. Afh’s letter, to the conclusion of this ecJairciIfemerit, which gave me inexpreflible relief.—-I can no way make you fenSible of my feelings.—I appeared to be juft efcaped from fome imminent danger ; dragged from the brink of a precipice.—In Short, 1 bad but juft recovered, without knowing, however, what reply to make to Afli, who ftill looked extremely difconcerted, when he proceeded in the
You have not yet heard all, madam.—What I have to fay will make me, it is true, appear more culpable, but I cannot be eafy till I have made a full confeflion. I did myfelf receive a fetter from my wife, in which fhe informed me, that though fhe had great reafon to believe fhe was odious to me, fhe could not, when fhe heard of my going to be married to another, without acting very unjuftly, refrain from endeavouring to prevent the execution of my defign. She then acquainted me that fhe had been partly confined by her relation, who wanted her to live with him as his miftrefs, and partly by a letter, which fhe had received from me foon after her landing in Ireland, wherein I affured her, that if fhe either wrote to me, or took the leaft ftep to-w'ards feeing me, or hearing from me, I would never fuffer her to come again in ray fight.
“ Many cruel expreffions (to repeat her own words) were added, which I declare almoft broke

We were all walking in the Park yefterday in the evening.—My father, unfortunately for him, was with us.—He has not been able for a. considerable time to get fo far from , the houfe; he could not have been fo far from it in a more un-

. ^
On a fudden we, were 'alarmed by the firing of a piftol clofe by my Sifter, who fcreamed out, “ Oh! my Dafhwood 1 Save my DaftiwoodJ.” and fainted. ^
He caught her in his arms, .crying out for help. At that inftant we faw a female figure rufti along the walk behind the trees, from whence the piftol had been difcharged. Some men; who had

been* digging a pond at a little diftanee ran after her, overtook her, and brought her back.—Never had I feen Such an object. Imagine one of the moil lovely faces in the world; this moment pale as death through terror, the next flulhed like crim-
fon with rage and fhame.---Daihwood having
Seated, his wife on the grafs, and Supported her on his bofom, call a look of horror and anguilh at the beautiful fury, and exclaimed, “ Infamous wretch] is it you who have dared to make an attack upon the life of the deareft, gentleft, beil of creatures?” preffing his lips to Lucy’s, cold face.—“ Speak to me, my angel,, my love -y, telb me where you are hurt.”-—Then turning, to my father,. “For Heaven’s fake. Sir—continued he—let that mon-fter be Secured, or there is no faying what mifchief lire may do.”
My father, flood for Some moments,, like myfelf, flupified with wonder.—The lady then—for Surely flie was exceedingly like one, bating her furious behaviour^—immediately cried, “ You are right, Sir; I db intend to do every thing in my power to revenge the infolent contempt you have fliewn for me,, by preferring your wife to me; though you once fwore that you never, loved her; nay thatfhe was your averfion, and that you married her merely for her money, by which you might be the better enabled to maintain me and my child.
You well know that I fpeak nothing but the truth, Daihwood; though you have not courage to own it before people who were not till now ac-
qiiainted with your diflembling arts.”
During
i 09 ]
During this Speech, which was delivered with great rapidity, her face glowing with rage, and her fine black eyes darting fire, my father and I flood looking at her with amazement.
Dalhwood, apprehending, I fuppofe, that my Sifter would be extremely Ihocked at So unexpeded a discovery, and terrified to think of the conSe-quences with which her fright would probably be attended, folded her cloSe to his boSom, and Said,. “ My deareft creature don’t be alarmed.—I have not, I confeSs, been So unexceptionable in every reSpeCt as 1 ought to have been to deServe your love; yet believe me, my angel, I have never ceafed to doat upon you; ever Since the blefled hour which made you mine have I felt a warm increafe of atfedtion.

Here, partly by grief,, partly by anger,, his voice was. flopped.—My Sifter, who had. not yet Spoke; railed her languid head from Dafh wood’s boSom,.and Said, “ Oh,. Sir! do not condemn him. unheard; he has ever been good and kind to me,-—Oh do not—do not reproach him.”—She could not pror ceed.—Dalhwood, indeed, would not Suffer her; for, catching her again in his. arms, he almoft

devoured her with kiflfes; thanked her over and over for condefcending to plead for him; begged her to be compofed, and intreated her to tell him whether She was hurt.-—Affuring him fhe was not, Ihe again laid her head gently on his bofom, with* out calling a look at her rival, without faying a word to her, while fhe waa Hill held by two of the men, from whom fhe Ilruggled to get loofe,—< Dalhwood deSired thoie men to fecure her, till he had conveyed my filler home. When fhe faw him bellow fo many endearments on his wife, Ihe turned pale, and feemed as ready to faint as my filler had been,—My father called to her conduc* tors, and bade them take care not to let her. efcape from them: telling them that they fhould be an-fwerable for her, if he did not find her when he got to the houfe.
As foon as fhe was out of fight—for fhe made no refinance after thofe orders to the people who led her along*—my father looked more than once at my Sifter with inexpreffible grief in his countenance, and as often at Dafhwood, with anger not to be defcribed.—Then taking my fifter haftily by the arm juft as Dafhwood had railed her from the ground—“ Come away, come away faid he— fond, foolifh girl, and learn to defpife a man who has dared to ule you in fo Scandalous a manner.”
Dafhwood, tenderly receiving her again in his arms, into which fhe threw herfelf, weeping, replied, Somewhat fiercely, “ If fhe \s your daughter, fhe is alfo my wife; and file has never received any Scandalous treatment from me; I have ever loved her too fondly to merit Such Severe language
from

from you.-—Yet I will confefs—added he. Softening his voice, and Speaking in that infinuating way, by which he wins all hearts—I have been to blame.—A man pofTefied of Such an angel as your dear Lucy is, ought never to have expoSed her to the ungovernable fury of So vile a wretch; but if you will indulge me with your attention, I am inclined to believe that I Ihall be able to remove a great part of your refentment againfl me.—I have certainly been much to blame, but never willingly. Since I knew your charming daughter j and were it poflible for you to conceive the mifery which I have endured upon this occaSion, you would, I am perSuaded, rather look on me as an objedt deServing your pity,^han your indignation.”
“ I will hear none of this Huff—Said my father. Scarce able to articulate thefe words. So inflamed was he with paflion—I know you are a Scoundrel, and have ruined my child.”
“ Nobody but the father of ray Lucy would have prefumed to call me So—replied Dafhwood, with a becoming Spirit—but there is nothing added he—which I would not Suffer for her dear
fake, and for her Sake alone—(Seeing her
pale.
Sir
let me intreat you, w.,. Give me time to recover
weeping, and trembling) to Spare me a moment.
—let me afTift her in getting to the houfe, and then do with me what you pleafe.”
My father was juft going to return an anfwer, which certainly would only have made bad worfe, when I interpofed, and endeavoured to make him SenSible of the neceflity there was for rendering my Sifter as cafy as poflible, w'ho, Supported by Dafhwood
[	i82	]
wood and me, made a Ihift to walk feebly to the houfe. He obliged her to fit down twice by the way to reft her, and discovered a tendernefs and anxiety about her beyond expreftion.
When they were near the door I went back to fee if my father wanted any help.—1 pitied him, indeed, exceflively, though I thought he had been too hot.
Dafhwood—-faid he, immediately on ray coming up to him, is the greateft of all rafcals, and ftiall not fleep another night under my roof.” “My dear Sir*--replied I—my lifter is too ill to be moved ; befides, the ftiock will, I fear,

prove fatal.
“ Oh ftie is
loft—^flie is gone for ever.—But
this villain lhall not ftay, fhall not, infult us, by triumphing over our mifery.”
In vain did I ftrive to Soften him' in my bro^ ther’s favour; for I really bcHeve, Cecilia, and fo I told my father, that never was there a man more fond of a woman than he was of my Sifter.—But he would not hear me; and though I informed him that I feared his refentment againft Mr. Dafhwood would affect her exceedingly in the condition fhe was in, he replied—“ She may as well die in that way as be Shot by bis w -*■—. How-whether fhe lives or dies, he Shan’t ftay any
ever
longer here.”
Accordingly, when my Sifter was put to bed and blooded—the Surgeon having affured us that fhe had received ho hurt but what her fright and concern had occasioned—my father Sent for Dafhwood. He would have gone, indeed, diredly into
her
[ 183 ]
her chamber, had I not held him by the coat, and and bej^ed him, on my knees, not to give her So much pain as to lee the man whom fhe could not help loving, treated rougll'-. With much difficulty, however, I prevci ttd him from going up, for he had got one foot upon the flairs.
Dafliwood coming down, in confequence of the meflage I had difpatched to him, my father flopped, and with a faultering voice bade him leave the houfe inflantly, and never fee him again.
He flatted at this unexpedted prohibition, and looked exceflively difconcerted; but foon recovering himfelf, he faid, with the moft Winning accents, “ I willingly fubmit to your pleafure, dear Sir; but only conSider, juft now, the poor fuffering angel above flairs—give yourfelf leave. Sir, to think a moment about her. She is your daughter, but fhe is my wife.—Any apparent remifihefs on my part, while fhe is in this affedling fituation, may wound her peace more cruelly than any thing which has hitherto pafled.—Suffer me, therefore, to attend her till fhe has got a little more flrength, till flie is a little more compofed, and then I will do as you think beft.”
“ Aye, that is, till you have wrought on her
---d diffembling tongue to believe
with your d----
every thing you have a mind to palm upon her
for truth.—No, Sir, leave my houfe diredlly— 1 thought you had more fpirit than to want bidding fo often.”
“ When I conSider what your Lucy endures. Sir—replied Dafliwood, ftill humbling himfelf
before
\
[ i84 ]
before my father; though I Saw plainly how much his humility coll him, for he was pale and red by turns; bit his lips, and lifted up his fine eyes, from which the tears of refentment and tendernefs Seemed ready to ftart—when I think of your dear daughter. Sir, I am almoft unmanned.”
" Why then—-faid my father, in a tone which
made me tremble-—I fwear by H---------n and earth,
that if you do not go from hence immediately, you ftiall be forced from my door; I will no longer be infulted with the fight of the vile deftroyer of nsy innocent child.”
“ And / fwear by the great G—d of H----------n!
•—replied Dafhwood, with all the fpirit of an injured man Sparkling in his eyes—that no human power Ihall compel me to leave my .wife, whom I have Sworn to love and to cherifh in ficknefs and in health.”
“ Then, by G—, anSwered my father, foaming with rage—you Shall both turn out together; and if Ihe will perfift in quitting her father’^ houfe to follow Such a contemptible Scoundrel, I Swear by all that’s Sacred I never more will look upon her as my child: nor Ihall Ihe, though perilhing with want, and in the extremity of wretche.dnefs, have a fingle Sixpence from me towards her relief.”
A deeper Sigh now rent poor Dalhwood’s bo-fom, who was, I think, a more pitiable obje£l, at that time, than my Sifter.—After having ftruggled for Some mbments with his diftrafiting emotions, he Said, You Ihall be obeyed. Sir; I cannot
venture
[	185	]
venture to hazard my Lucy’s life by removing her in her prefent condition.—Do you^ my dear mifs Grafton, my dear Sifter—continued he—I will from henceforward deferve the name of brother Do you Supply the place of her Dalhwood to her.
Tell her that he will not be able to enjoy any reft till file is recovered, and believes him to be true to her alone; tell her that he would now have flown to her with all the eager hafte of ardent love, had not Sir Robert’s cruelty denied him that transporting fatisfaQ;ion.—Oh ! tell her, my good, kind friend, every thing that I would' fay myfelf, were I blefled enough to watch by her dear fide, and to endeavour to compofe her agitated mind, that the health of the beft of women may not be entirely deftroyed by her unhappi-nefs.”
With thefe words, which were delivered in a tremulous voice, while tears rolled down his manly face, he prefled my hand, and departed from the houfe.
As foon as he was gone my father alked whither the vile creature was carried. On being told that Ihe had been in fits in the back parlour ever Since they had brought her to the houfe, in which a fervant, who had waited on mils Bellers, had been endeavouring to recover her, he ordered her, before fhe was well come to herSelf, to be carried home, and ftriQ;ly watched, that Ihe might make no farther attempts upon his family.

My angel Lucy is out of danger; with a lofs indeed which I cannot help lamenting; but moft gratefully do I offer up my acknowledgments to heaven for her prefervation.—’Tis very hard—his very hard to be denied the heart-felt faj-isfadfion of feeing her, of watching by herTide, and of giving' her the flrongeft proofs of my unalterable tender-nefs; but as Sir Robert is ib violently incenfed againif me, and as I do really think I in'Some measure deferve corretlion from hiin,^! am the, more ready to put up with his galling freatment; flill more fo on my dear Lucy’s account,’who muff be a considerable Sufferer in point 'of fortune, if I take her from her father,—No—I'.will not involve her
As much as I' lan^uifh for her Sweet

That abominable wretch—I cannot bring my-felf to write her detefted name—has been delirious ever Since; Ihe was Carried home yefterday.—She was undoubtedly out of her fenfes when Ihe attempted to commit fo horrid an adlion, the remembrance of which makes me, at this moment, Ihudder.
Yefterday Ihe came to herfelf (but is ftill in a. high fever) and confefled before Sir Robert, my father, and Mr. Goldlby, the acting juftice here, whom Sir Robert took with him on purpofe,, every thing that has pafled between her and me with much clearnefs, and in a concife manner;, concluding in the following terms ; “ When I found that Mrs. Dalhwood had entirety gained his alFedtions from me,, I was not a little mortified,, chagrined, and provoked ; but when he took away my boy from me, I grew quite defperate. In confequence of the various emotions, all of the torturing kind, which I felt, I took lodgings at a very retired farm-houfe in the neighbourhood, pretending to be a foreigner.'—There I practifed the firing of a piftol, ordering Ellis to tell the people that women abroad were accuftomed to hunt with piftois, and that I had a mind to try if I could take aim at any fmall birds in the fields, in which I fpent the greateft part of the day, when the weather was favourable.—As foon as 1 thought I w^as pretty expeit in my exercife, I frequented Sir Robert’s Park, the avenues to which were never fhut up but at particular times, and frequently faw Mrs. Dafhwood, mifs Grafton, and Mr. Dalhwocd walking, hut never could get near

Deprived of the fight of my Lucy l am fufficir-ently unhapp-ythe behaviour of her father to mine has made me more fo.—Their meeting at mifs Bellers’s was accidental; for Sir Robert not only refuSed to admit my father when he called on him, but was rude enough to return no anfwer to his letter.—He treated him like an utter ftranger, though Mr. Goldfby, who is their common neighbour, ftrove to convince Sir Robert that he had
carried
[	192	]
carried things with too high a hand. By Ihewing a contempt for that good breeding which is due from one gentleman to another.—Lord Bud'worth is not furely to anfwer for the vices and follies of his Son; he wants no addition to the difquietude which he feels on that fon’s- account.—*Thus you fee, Moftyn, I receive Severe chaftiz-ement from every quarter.—Certain am I that, tortured as my mind is at prefent, the remembrance of all my pafl: unlawful pleafures is painful beyond ex-preffion—almoSt beyond endurance.— One fatis-fadtion, however, is left for me—the Safety of my boy; my poor dear Ned is not, thank God,.in the hands of his horrid mother.—-I Sent Hopkins for him yeflerday, as I intend to remain at this
little dwelling.'—I have agreed to take the apart-

ment I occupy at prefent, by the month.—I miji
be near my Lucy.—May time and my Sincere contrition Soften Sir Robert in my favour !—I cannot bear the thoughts of' taking her from her family, and by So doing, of depriving her of a child’s right, an eldeft daughter’s right to his af-fedtion.—to mjfelf I could live happy in the moft obfcure, in the meanell cottage; but I muft not be inftrumental to her being reduced to fo degrading, fo unde Serve da Situation; what a fitua-tion for her who has been bred up in the raidd' ef affluence, and who enjoyed the gratification of her excellent heart’s every wife—before fee knew me-.
While I am thus circumfianced, Ned will help me to pafs away my lonely hours, and lave me from the horrors of defpair.—The dear little fol-

There would be, 1 think, a want of decency in fuch a ftep at preSent, and it might render my lord liable to ftill grofler inSults from Sir Robert, who does not a8: at all tike a gentleman, However, as he is the father of my dear Lucy, my gentle amiable wife, I will Spare him.

OOR lady Charbury is no more.—I have hardly flrength or fpirits left to relate the melancholy fcene—but I will try, for I can think of nothing elfe.
1 ftepped into the chariot the moment it was ready, about twelve o’clock, and was foon whirled into the court-yard at Elm-Park.—I was foon too at the top of the flairs; but I trembled fo that I could hardly Support myfelf.
When the Servant opened the door I fawthe poor unfortunate young creature haflening to her diffo-Jution, the approaches of which were flrongly painted in her face.—My lord was fitting upon the bed, holding One of her hands, while fhe flretch-ed out the other to me, but could not fpeak.—For part I was as unable to articulate a fyllable. ;
My

My lord bowed, and Said, in a faultering voice, ** You are very good, mifs Grafton.”—He feemed to be violently agitated, and frequently put his poor Gonftantia’s hand to his lips, while Jhe fixed her dying eyes alternately on us both; only faying, in accents hardly intelligible, “ I die contented, fince I fee my dear, dear lord, and my friend near me.— Oh! my dear mifs Grafton—continued Ihe—-fay
and do what you can to comfort my lord.”
I hung my head, and blulhed exceffively ; I could only prefs her poor cold hand in return.
Raifing herfelf as well as fhe could in her weak condition, fhe threw her arms round her Charbu-ry’s neck, and cried, “ Farewell forever, my dear lord. — May Heaven blefs you for all your good-nefs to your Conftantia.”—Then, finking upon her pillow, file expired without a fingle groan..
I cannot tell you what paUed immediately.—I fat quite ftupified in my chair, equally unable to fpeak or to ftir.—I was, at laft, rouzed by fome drops adminiftered to me by my lord, who gave me his hand to lead me into another room.—Neither of us, however, fpoke for fome time.-—Recovering himfelf,, at length,, a little,, he made a con* fufed kind of an apology for having fent for me in fo abrupt a manner,, and for having expofedme to fo terrible a fhock.—‘‘ But' I could not—I' could not—added, he-—behold the poor creature drawing towards the end of her. exigence, without giving, her the fatisfa6tion which ftie fo earneftly defired.

I bowed a reply, and inftantly gave a turn to the conversation, by alking particulars concerning the dreadful accident. My lord’s information was pretty much like that which I had received from his Servant; he only added, that he feared her death was haftened by her pregnancy.
1 then rofe to go.—He led me to the carriage, and opened his mouth Several times to Speak, but clofed it again, without uttering a word.—He looked exceedingly diftrefled, and my filly heart fighed to relieve him, while my tears flowed for the poor young creature, who had been So precipitately Snatched from all her joys in the bloom and pride of youth.. How fleeting, how precarious is every thing in this world!—I really have, of late, met with So many diSgufting occurrences, that f am almofl: weary of my life.—My Spirits are So fatigued, I cannot, poflibly, proceed..

The Honourable Edward Dashwood to Sir

OH, my friend I my Moftyn, never was there
So happy a fellow as your Dafliwood. — I have thoufand things to communicate which have given me pleafure; but an unexpedled interview with Lucy has filled me with joy unutterable.— In the firfl: place, however, let me tell you that I became more eafy by hearing that Die had left this

part of the country.—Her fever falling upon her fpirits flie was judged to be in a decline, and is gone, by her phySician’s order, to Briftol, to try the waters of the Salutary Spring there ; but though there can be no hopes of her returning alive, I will not—-I cannot—fay that I felt any fatisfafition upon the occaSion. I could not hear of the probably approaching death of a poor creature, who had So often made me happy, and to whoSe miSery 1 believed my Self acceflary, without considerable emotions of the compaffionating kind. While I eagerly kiffed her charming boy, tears of contrition and anguilh rulhed into my eyes, and watered his innocent face. The Sweet child wiped them
away with his pretty hands, and Said, “ Don’t cry, my dear papa; your little Ned will always love you dearly.” Setting down the atfeding prat-tier I bade him go and amufe himSelf j but he could nether mind his play nor any thing elfe till I grew lefs difturbed.—By refleaion I Soon came to my-Self, and 1 found my heart lighter than ever, when 1 considered that my dear wife would not be thrown again into a dangerous Situation by mifs Bellers’s outrageous behaviour.—How cruelly have I been alarmed Since the vile attempt with the piftol!
In the evening I took a walk with my boy, in order to reward him for his aflFeaion for me. Before 1 was aware my feet brought me to Sir Robert’s Park; the gate for foot paffengers was open. Ned, with all the curioSity of a child of his age, ran in, crying, “ Here is a pretty place,, papa.”— I called him back, but he ran on; I then purfued him that I might bring him away. At a little distance I Saw my Lucy.—H-----ns! how my heart

I longed to approach her, but was afraid, not knowing if Ihe would approve of my advancing.—I therefore flood flilb waiting for her coming nearer to me.—I then calledr the boy, who was jumping in the grafs, and loudly, rather angrily, bade him come outbut the heedlefs little rogue did not mind me. — At that inflant, Lu^

‘‘ Yes, madam—replied Ned—if you pleafe.”
“ Pretty fellow—Said the dear girl, killing him —afk your papa to let you be mine.”
He then ran to me, and I led him back, but could not Speak; her angelic behaviour had almoll deprived me of my fenSes.—She caught him in her arms, and looking at us both, Said, What a pidure of my Dalhwood !”
** Set him down, my dearefl: creature—anSwer-ed I—he is too heavy for you; I hope we Shall have many Such reSemblances. Yet what do I not deServe for having occafioned our prefent disappointment.”
She bluShed, and taking hold of my hand, told me She was quite happy in being with me.—We then walked forward, and talked over our Situation, while Ned took poSTeSIion of one of the flaps of my coat.
When I had a thoufand times expreffed the transports which I felt on feeing her, and on enjoying her charming conversation again, I repeatedly perfuaded her not to add fuel to Sir Robert’s refentment on my account.—After having mutually protested to be eternally faithful to each other, and to love each other to the laSl moments of our lives, we thought it prudent to Separate, left we Should be discovered; not without promifing, however, to meet again in the Same place the following evening. Lucy again kiSSed my boy, and told him that She would bring Some cakes to him.

Before I tore myfelf away from her Ihe ac-tjuainted me with lady Charbury’s death.—Th® next morning I received a card from his lordfhip, in which he earneftly defired to fee me, as he could not properly make me a vifit, according to his intentions.
I called on him.—He kept me a great while, talking of Bab, with whom, I find, he is Hill more enamoured than ever 5 but he infills upon my not difcovering, his fentiments about her, at lead not yet.—He was exceedingly friendly, made me an offer of his houfe, and even very much preffed me to flay with him then, and to fend for my little Ned, being, he added, very fond ’of children. He fpoke very handfomely of his wife, and with a great deal of concern about her; faying, that the manner and fuddennefs of her death had fhocked him prodigioufly.—He appeared, however, not a little pleafed to find that my filler was not going to be married to Mr. Afh.
The promified hour approaches.—I fhould be in the Park long before the appointed time, to contemplate upon my yeflerday’s exquifite felicity.

the
[	20?7	]
the dear girl appeared, and then Saw her hurrying, almoft out of breath.
She began with an apology for having made me wait.—I flopped her charming mouth with kifles, and led her to a mofly feat, but would not let her fpeak, till flie had a little recovered herfelf.—I was contented with the thoufand dimpling fmiles which played about her fweet face, while Ihe liflened to the tenderefl effufions that ever iflued from a tranfported heart, intoxicated with its hap-pinefs. Yet I could not help fighing to fee her look fo pale, after the illnefs which I had brought upon her. I fighed, though her palenefs, indeed, gave a new delicacy to her elegant complexion: but nothing could equal the richnefs of that complexion, whenever the praifes which I lavifhed on her threw her fine face into a glow.—With what ardor did I prefs her beautifully turned fingers to my lips y I could hardly bear to part with her fweet hands, while I gaz-ed on her mofl expreflive countenance, and every now and then kifled her auburn locks, blown by the evening breeze over her lovely forehead.
While I was in this manner delightfully employed, fhe told me flie could repeat her vifits to me every day, as her father had the gout flying about him, but chiefly in his feet, and could not walk fo far, at prefent.—She then enquired after my little boy.—I informed her that I had left him fafe with Hopkins ; upon which fhe gave me fome fweetmeats for him, and defired me to bring him to her the next time I came.

Where is there a wife who would, m
Similar

The mention of my boy naturally led to a con-verfation about him ^ and m fpeaking of hiTn it was almcff impoffible not to take fome notice of his detefted mother. — Like a fool, willing to make myfelf appear in a meritorious light, the better to delerve fuch an angel, 1 began to plume myfelf upon my difcretion, which had prevented her from ever receiving any uneafinefs on my ac-. count, or from entertaining fufpicions about my

“H--------n’s !—cried.I, and had you patience,
had you consideration enough to keep the contents of her letter to yourfelf ?”
“ Yes, my love—replied fhe, with a fmile—-I did not communicate them to a living creature, not even to my dear Bab.”
Then you are indeed an angel,” cried I, turning from her, quite afhamed of myfelf, and abafhed, from a confcioufnefs of her Superiority.
“ Nay, do not praife me for my behaviour; it has merited no encomiums, for I will own now that it cofl me a great deal to conceal the emotions

[	209	]
which I felt upon the occahon.—You had, indeed, almoll: found me out once.”
She then told me that fhe had juft read Die’s letter when I furprifed her in tears; and with fo much earneftnefs urged her to difcover the caufe of them.
Poor, dear, amiable fufferer 1 my heart bleeds this moment, to think of what ftie has endured for my fake.
I could not help pouring forth execrations againft the wretched Bellers; Severely reproaching my^ felf, at the fame time, for not having acquainted her with my unfortunate attachment.
Laying her foft white hand on my mouth, flie bade me fpare an unhappy woman, whofe greateft mifery muft have arifen, after the lofs of virtue, from the lofs of me.

As foon as I recovered myfelf a little, l afked her to let me fee the vile letter, which could not but have given her considerable uneafinefs.
She affured me that fhe had burnt it direOily, and that fhe would not have pained tjtiQ with the contents of it for the world.

Were ,all wives like mine, Moftyn, marriage would be indeed a bleffed ftate; a heaven on earth.
I fat, for Some time, buried in aftonifhment, loft in Silent adoration, forgetting every thing. At laft, catching her again in my arms, I found her cloaths damp with the evening dew. I rofe inftantly, and, fearing Ihe Ihould take cold, inSiftcd upon her going home, though moft forry to be under a neceffity of preffing her to leave me ; but her health was at ftake, and my regard for that fwallowed up ail felfilh motives.—She rofe and took hold of my arm, and we walked flowly towards the houfe.—It was almoft dulk, and nobody appeared; but when we came within about a hundred yards of it, Ihe withdrew her arm, and faid, “ Good night, my love j Ihall I fee you again to-morrow ?”

“No, my deareft will think on fome fcheme.

‘‘ Feaft on your beauties, my angel,” anSwered I, once more embracing her.
She then broke Srom me, blulbing, and ran into the houSe; I waited till they were all quiet, and then Hepped Softly up Hairs.
Luckily, the apartment allotted to my wife and me was in one of the wings, which is very large, and op polite to that occupied by Sir Robert.— However, when I entered the chamber, Ridley, who was employed about her lady’s things, flarted^ as if Hie had Seen a ghoH, and was, I believe, ready to fliriek; but I foon made her fenfible of the neceffity there was for her being both quiet and Secret.—As Hie is very much attached to my wife.

After having waited a considerable time, bridling my impatience as well as I could, I heard her foftly trip up flairs; I threw open the door haflily, and was going to embrace her,—The dear angel was loaded with jellies, a large bottle, and Some potted partridge.—When fhe had put them on a table, ihe took out ot her pocket a French roll neatly wrapped up in paper, and Some fweetmeats.-

“ My dear life—Said I, paflionately careffing her -—what trouble has your exquifite tenderneSs given you!—And, indeed, Lucy, I have no Sort of inclination to eat; but I am more weary than you can imagine,” continued I, fighing, and looking on her tenderly.

I ga2.ed on her with wonder and with love, and my love increaSed every moment; but though I wanted no food myfelf, I thanked her a thoufand times for her tender care of me, and even bluflied to fee her reduced to take Such methods, which, however, fully convinced me of the Sincerity of her affection.—After having partaken of juft enough of her entertainment to Shew my gratitude, I told her that I looked upon that as my bridal night, as I fhould come to her arms more entirely her’s than

She, at firft, made a little oppofition, but at length confented, provided I would only let her bid Ridley tell her filler that fhe had retired for the night,—“ Bab—continued Ihe—has behaved, to me in the moil friendly and affe6:ionate manner,, and is very much attached to me.

A M the happiell of mortals.—My Lucy and I not only fee each other every day, but almofl: every hour in the day. I have gained the Servants ; and as Sir Robert cannot ramble much at prefent I live entirely at my eafe. I breakfaft with ray wife, my angel, every morning; then go home, and fpend an hour with Ned; meet my dear girl again in the park or garden (for I have even ventured into the garden) before dinner; then return home, and dine with my boy, and go in Search of my Lucy, whom I leave not till the next day.—I am become quite another creature; 1 have now no load upon my mind, nothing to be alhamed of; I am as light as air.—My charming love too, convinced of the Sincerity of my reformation and of my fidelity to her, is happier than ever.—We pafs our days, like the firfl: pair, in Paradife.
Bab and Charbury are alSo perpetually together ; but they do not Seem to make any thing of their conversations yet; he cannot, it is true, with decency, make any offers So Soon after the death of his wife; nor will he think of making any till he imagines they will not be refufed. As to my lively fitter, fhe appears with her ufual vivacity; but I can fee that fhe is at times not So well pleafed as fhe Seems to be; fhe is quite
Silent,
[ 219 ]
lilent, however, upon this fubjeft to Lucy; and my dear girl is, indeed, too much engaged to attend to her.—-They are all fond of Ned, whom I brought one day with me, at my wife’s earnell re-queft, to the park.
Charbury faid he was a glorious boy; and looking at Bab, added, that he mull beg him, as he had not one of his own.
She did not, I thought, like that Speech; for flie made up a lip at my lord. Then, taking the child in her lap, as we were fitting on a bench, (he alked him which of us two he would have for his papa.
The young rogue fmiled, and pointed at me. Bab faid, it was a wife child who knew his own father.—Surely Ihe cannot fuppofe that lord Charbury had any conneQiion with Die!—I actually believe he never faw her but in public; nor do I imagine that he ever had any attachments like mine.' Juftice obliges me to fay that Bellers never gave me room to believe Ihe was ever unfaithful to me. As much as Ihe had diftreffed me, I Ihould think I wronged her if I charged her with infidelity. The boy is fo like me too.—Yet Bab certainly fuf-peQ:ed lord Charbury, who, entirely undeferving of fuch an attack, did not receive it as it was intended.—He loves her, I am ftrongly of opinion; but as there are no rivals at prefent, there is no occafion for his being in a hurry.
We had in the evening of that day a little concert in a temple in the park. The two charming fillers fung to their mandolines; I accompanied them upon the violencello, and Charbury played
the
[ 220 ]
the German flute. My Lucy warbled out Such
melting notes that they ravilhed my fenfes, and my lord, I thought, Seemed no lefs delighted with Bab’s melodius tones.—They will come to a good underftanding, I truft, by and by.

HERE is, pofitively, no bearing Dalhwood. He is grown So horribly provoking within thefe few days, that I mufl: leave him and his Lucy

been So diftra^ledly fond of her that he is perpetually playing the fool,—Their fooleries may be very allowable^ perhaps, in private; but I am Sure they fliould not be exhibited before my lord, who thinks he is licenfed by them to take the fame liberties with me. Dalhwood never walks with his wife without putting her arm through his. My lord, therefore, always makes a fimilar attempt upon mine ; though I afilually believe he does it more from imitation than inclination.—:By this behaviour of he vexes me : I pull my hand away a hundred times; he Hill catches it again.—Nay, the other night, when Lucy and I had been both finging to them at their requeft, Charbury absolutely Seized my hand, and carried it to his lips, while Dafli-wood was in bis raptures with Lucy ; and becaufe I Snatched it away in a hurry he Seemed not at all Satisfied: he pofitively pouted.

Dalhwood is become a mere romp ; Lucy likes every thing he likes ; and lord Cbarbury is quite ready to fall in with their ridiculous amufements.—■ After the mulic, therefore, I went and fat by my~ felf at a diflance from them.—In a fliort time my lord followed me, and fat down by me.—I affedled not to fee him, but leant my head upon my hand.
“ Are you not well, mifs Grafton ?” faid he at laft.

“ I have got the head-ach, my lord—replied I, rather peevifhly—and Ihould be glad to be quiet.”
He rofe immediately, Sighed, and retired to a feat a little farther off, but where he could fee me.
I fighed too, like a Simpleton as I am, after I had fent him away, and grew out of humour with myfelf; confequently in humour with him.—I ftrove, however, to prevent his, reading the emotions of my heart in my features; but he was fo affiduous about me as foon as I permitted him to approach, fo earneftly intreated me to lean on him to reft me as we walked homeward; prefled my hand fo gently, and looked fo concerned for my fuppofed illnefs, that my ficknefs and fretfulnefs— I do not know how—fled away together, and I became quite another creature.—He, as if determined to conduct himfelf juft as / did, grew excemve-ly lively all on a hidden.—In ftiort, we were fur-prifed to hear a clock ftrike twelve.—I wondered every moment that he made no effort to take his leave, yet I dreaded, I confefs, the moment of his departure.

At length he rofe, made an apology for flaying So late, hoperl my head was thoroughly well, and declared that he had not power to leave his charming friend, while fhe was indifpofed.

With a warmer prefSure of my hand than ufual, he added, ‘‘ Will you not be my friend, mifs Grafton—fixing his eyes earneflly on my face reckon upon fo great a felicity

When he had uttered thefe words he haflily quitted me, and I went up to my chamber to reflect upon them; but I cannot y^et make any thing of them to give me any fatisfadtion.

However,, during my filence 1 confidered,, that to a man who had? the moll unexceptionable character, to a man to whom my father wilhed earnellly to be allied, to the man who had fo nobly behaved to the girl committed to his care,^ and in fo ho.-? nourable a manner to me,- a very rigid referve was altogether abfurd and unneceffary.—In confequence of this way of thinking, I honeftly replied, when he urged me to deliver him from a Hate of the molt painful fufpence,. that he had always been dear to me, and that if he really imagined I could make him happy, E was ready to give him my hand,, with my father’^ confent, which P freely permitted him to follicit.

LETTER LXXL
The Honourable Edward Dashwood to Sir
Francis Mostyn, Bart.
Have juft now received a letter from poor, unhappy Bellers, who expired a few hours after fhe wrote it, after having firft defired that it might not be fent to me before her deceafe.—I hope it is a fincere proof of her penitence. She acknowledges
t m ]
ledges all her faults in it, but conftfles that her unalterable affetSlion for me was the caufe of her laft ralh a61ion, and of her death.—What a cutting confeflion !—She declares >Ihe -could not live deprived of my love,, moft ardently implores my fcrgivenefs, and earneftly recommends her .poor dear boy to my prote6i:icn; afluring me folemnly that he is mine ; that Since fhe knew me Ihe never had any conneQ;ion with other men, though frequently follicited, and that the certainty of my loving the child was the greateft confolation to her in her dying momentsv—She concludes thus pathetically .* ‘‘ May you, my for ever loved Dafh-woodjbe ever bleffed with your Lucy, who deferves all your tendernefs, becaufe fhe never fwerved from the paths of virtue to obtain it. PoflefTed of a heart fo truly excellent, fhe will not, furely, ob-je6t to your fhewing lomeTegard for a child, who is not the lefs innocent, becaufe his parents were guilty. Adieu, for ever.—^Give my dear boy a Lfs for his-dying mother.”
You cannot imagine how this letter affe£led me. I could mot even recover myfelf fo entirely, but that.a idejeftion appeared upon my countenance whenT met my Lucy.—She kindly queftioned me about my dejeftion, and I freely confelTed the truth.—The dear angel fondly kiffed me, and faid fhe loved me the more for my fenfibility; adding, that fhe would be a mother to my boy ; nor could I make her eafy till I fetched the little fellow, over whom 1 had been weeping till I had quite made him melancholy, fo that he ^^eally wanted her
kind
t 245 ]
her kind notice to revive him.—She dcSired me to Set him by her, kilTed him, called him her dear Ned, and gave him a pocket-book and pencil, with which he was fo delighted, that he came to me to teach him to wr//r, though he is hardly able to read.
In Continuation
What a trying Scene !—And yet it has produced the moll perSeft felicity I can talle in this world.
After having dined with Ned, as I ufually do, when my Lucy is not ill, I went to meet her by appointment in the honey-fuckle bower, juft at the entrance of the park from the garden. The weather was exceflively hot; and I was aim oft Sorry that I had not defired her to remain in the houSe till the return of the evening had made the air more agreeable, efpecially when I Saw her toiling down on the walk which led to this pleafant Spot, which is always eligible.—I even ran out to meet her, though 1 went out of bounds by So doing. Taking her in my arms I brought her into the Shade, placed her upon the Seat, and made her reft on my boSom.—She looked as handSome as an angel, the heat having given an uncommon glow to her complexion; hut as She was too tightly laced for a woman in her conditon, on purpoSe indeed to conceal k, I was alarmed, being apprehenfivc of bad confequences, and inSifted upon her unpinning her gown, and loofening her ftays.—She complied with my requeft, to oblige me j but Site was
VoL. II.	U	fo

t 246 ]
fo tired with all this, that as Soon as it was done (he fell afleep in my arms. Glad was I to fee her fo charmingly compofed.
While I was gazing on her dear face, holding her enraptured, imagine my terror and furprize to fee Sir Robert coming down the walk, leaning upon his canet—-I could neither fly nor hide, without waking my dearefl; girl; and I would rather have fufiered any thing than have frightened ; I hoped, indeed, that however angry he might be with he would, for his daughter’s fake, confider —Therefore, as foon as I faw him enter the
me
me.
bovver with all the marks.of afton’ilhment and fury in his countenance, I lifted up my hands and eyes in a Supplicating attitude, and begged him to Spare his child.
“ Villain !—cried he, forgetting every thing have you again Seduced her ?”
She inftantly .Rarted at his angry voice.

A
O
my father—faid fhe, eagerly Springing from my arms, in which I ftrove to detain her, and falling upon her knees at his feet—^Oh, Sir, forgive him— pardon my Dalhwood—receive him as your Son,; the kindefl; of hufbands.”
Tier Sighs and tears fall ftreaming, which pierced my foul with anguifh unutterable, flopped her.; while I, bufy over her, urged her to rife, and begged her to be compofed; but finding that fhe paid no regard to me, and hearing Sir Robert, who had glanced his eyes on her Ihape, Say, “ I fee, I fee how it is.—Who would be curfed with
daughters?” I threw myfelf on my knees before
%
him.
[	247	]
him, and vowed never to leave him till I had ob-
tained his forgivenefs for us both, when you hear all. Sir—continued

I
Though you will
find that your daughter is too much an angel to
want It.”
The eagernefs with which I fpoke, added to his favourite daughter’s diftrefsful fituation, and particular condition, with which, notwithftanding what he faid, he was not difpleafed, I believed, as he always wilhed for grand-children, at lafl: wrought upon him in her favour. He bad her get up, and take care of herfelf.
** Never will I rife—Said the amiable creature till my hufband receives your pardon. Sir.”
** Pfhaw !—replied Sir Robert—the girl is an idiot.—Surely he has bewitched you Lucy,” added' he, offering her his hand to raife her.
She refpeftfully and affeckionaetly kiffed it, but remained in the fame pofture. ,
Frighted to death left her continuance upon her knees might be too painful for her. Untreated her in fuch earneft terms to let me lift her from the ground, that Sir Robert cried, “ Take her up, and let. me hear what you can both fay for your-felves.”
“ No, no—replied he, apparently coming into humour, though lothat firft to own the change our behaviour had made in him—I will talk with her here,” fitting down by his daughter, who taking him by one hand, and calling me to fit on the other fide of her, faid, Now I am between my two dcareft friends on earth. Let me.
U 2
my dear Sir
added
[	248-

—added flie, looking wilhfully at her father—let me have the happinels of joining your hands,”

Sir Robert overcome, at length, by her winning voice, and her alFefiting. manner, fuffered her to make us friends; though he fwore roundly, that if ever he found reafon to repent of his ealinefs, ■it fhould be worfe for us both.
, It is quite unneceflary for me. Sir Robert, either to promife or fwear upon the occafion ; a fin-gie glance from my dear Lucy will at any time hinder my roving from her arms.—With whom, indeed, but with her, can I expedt to find the ex-quifite felicity which I at prefent enjoy
The lovely creature fmiled, confcious of her power over me, and tranfported to fee her father fo complying.—We foon afterwards went towards the houfe, and Sir Robert honoured me fo far as to accept of my arm to aflifl: him in getting home, not having been fo far lince he had the lall fit of the gout.
The happy Charbury and Bah, who are now equally fond of each other, and only wait till the expiraticn of the mourning for the completion of their felicity, were agreeably furprifed, and ex-preffed the greateft fatisfadUon to fee us fo unexpectedly re-united.—My delicate Lucy blufhcd at the diforder of her drefs, which file had not had leifure, which (he had indeed totally forgot, to alter j. while I, fearful only about her health, told her,, and I told the truth, that fhe never looked half fodovely.—In the evening, with Sir Robert’s confent, I took, polfeffion of my old apartment; and I. hope that my deareft girl has received no
hurt
[ 249 ]
hurt from her furprlze.—She had' the addrefs the next day to prevail on Her father to make a vifit to mine.—‘‘ Mr. Dalhwood—faid he, after break-fall—I have been rude, I am afraid, to lord Bud^ worth; I have been too much ruffled to attend to forms; but if you will go with me L will order the chariot.’’
You may be fure I darted no objedlion to that motion.—Before we fetout, however, I kifled my


Lucy,, and told her that it v/as all /5^r doing.”
We were mod cordially received by my excels lent father.; and who fliould I find with him but that fmiling little rogue Ned, whom he had fent for. The boy dew to me before I was aware.— My lord faw ray confufion, and made an apology to Sir Robert, by faying, that he fhould be Ms boy,^ and never trouble either me. or my wife..
Aye, but I dare fweari	lord—replied Sir
Robert—that fhe will trouble Mm; he is too like your fbn to pafs unnoticed by my daughter.”
I hope we fhall have one dill more like him. Sir Robert—faid my lord —to call you grandfather.”
^ And who will be wy grand-papa ?—faid the faucy little fellow—Sir ?” looking up in my father’s face.
“ Aye, boy,” replied he, patting his head.---Then turning to Sir Robert, “ The child is innocent—continued he—and we mud make him, if we can, a better man than his father has been.” “ Faith—faid Sir Robert—he will be but too like him j the wenches will never let fuch hand-
forae
[ 250 ]
Some fellows alone; So ! believe we miifl: e’en take them with all their faults.”
While thefe two old gentlemen were fettling fo important an affair, I was playing with Ned, who aflced me where that pretty lady was who gave him
the book and penciU
“ That’s my daughter. I’ll lay half my eflate— faid Sir Robert.—Well, you muft take care of him among you; and if fhe brings me as fine a boy,.we may think ourfelves very well fatisfied after all, my lord.”
The joy which my dearefl creature felt on fee* ing us return with my father, whom Sir Robert too prefllngly invited to dine with him to be refufed,
is not to bedefcribed.—Pray H--n that thisywr-
prize may be attended with no dangerous confe-quences.—When I think of the tendernefs .of her. conflitution, and the delicacy of her frame, I am every hour alarmed .—To conclude—I am the hap-
pieft of men, becaufe I am uqited to the. befl: of wives.
