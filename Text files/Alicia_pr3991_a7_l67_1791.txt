to me—-but at

I have indicated this to Young Eustace, but my words, instead of being deemed friendly, were evidently treated as officious, for Henry communicated them immediately to the colonel—he,, poor,, vain, garrulous mortal, both betrayed and expofed his friend Thus my old remark was veri-

^HOUGH I am always happy
to hear Srom my friend, yet when the contents of his letter indicate distreSs, believe me, I am then Sorry at the receipt of it. My Sister Julia has written to Mils Mortimer with all the eloquence the Subject could admit oS—She has invited her to our houSe, to stay, if postible, a month, during which time, I think the happineSs of my dear Frederick, notwith-standing the obstinacy of Mr. Morton, may be completed.—Mrs.

Percy, with whom your Alicia lives, is, I think, beginning to be Somewhat circumfpective about her. This naturally leads me to imagine the old lady is a near relation of hers—Indeed, as I understand Mrs. Percy is a woman of no great family, or fortune, this fuppofition appears to me fo much stronger. No woman, fo indigent as Mrs. Percy, would keep a young lady {as Mifs Mortimer herfelf confestes) without a proper allowance being made, therefore, I fuppofe, Mr. Morton, who, I dare fay, has enquired into every circumstance about her, has fo peremptorily objected to the union, efpecially as she thinks her family, tho’ unknown, fo much beneath your’s—for I must imagine-—if my friend were
not

not the Son of Some very reSpe6l-able gentleman, he would not have been under the care of Mr. Morton, nor be poffest of the education and fortune he is—^thougsh it would not become me to reproach my friend on account of his choice, yet if I thought there was occafion I most certainly would.—^However, Mifs Mortimer, in my opinion, is deferving of a Frederick.—She is all that a man (who has no lucrative views) can
wifh or defire—and I wifh as much

oftener the destruction of the latter —for this reafon, I am reSolved never to marry till my fister is provided for—My father has left me (and only me) a competency to fupport us both, and I think it no more than fraternal duty to take care of a folitary fister—Wtere I to marry, an increafe of family would diminish our portion, and render me, perhaps, incapable of ferving her—not only that, but perhaps Julia and her fister-in~law might not live in that harmony and peace which we do now.
It is a difagreeable thing that your pupil is fo wild and ungovernable—his friend the colonel has told me fome stories of him which I donst like—I am therefore refolved

■—I am however astonished to hear that Colonel Prattle and he are fo often together—the Colonel astured me that he fpeaks very difrefpect-fully of every body, efpecially you and me.—It is therefore no great matter how foon my friend and he were parted, but I believe Mr. Morton hopes, by your retaining this fituation, his lordfhip (who is a.very old man) may leave you Something—I would not therefore advife my friend to quarrel with his own interest, nor do I think if Mifs Mortimer and he were married, it would be proper, at least till the death of lord Eustace, to

I forgot to tell you, that when my fister was writing to Mifs Mortimer, I advifed her not to mention your name, for fear her fcrawl might fall into improper hands, and be of more differvice than utility to us—as foon as we receive her anfwer, you may expect to hear from your most affectionate and fincere friend.

To tell the truth, Julia, I did not join in Mrs, Percy’s afiSertion, for I could never utter a declara-ration foreign to my heart—However, Mr. Stanford’s rage ,was fomewhat appealed.-—! confefs my fpirits were very much funk—I could not imagine the reafon of Mr. Stanford’s affuming fo much authority in the houfe—and being disappointed, as I thought, of feeing my dear Julia, was quite out of humour with the old gentleman

my re-entering I thought the con-verfation between Lady Melville and him was rather warm-—I naturally concluded that Mr. Morton, who you know is a very blunt man, was chiding her ladyfhip in a friendly manner for giving way to her defpondency—this fupposttion arofe from the reception I met with

Oh, Charles!—how cruel!—before my guardian and Lady Melville I was obliged to offer my hand, where my heart was not—my Sorrow was the more increafed by her ladyship’s acceptance of it—and Mr. Morton, I thought. Somewhat pacified—the Subject of the ball was, immediately dropt.
About a few minutes after Mifs Mortimers name was repeated, and while Mr. Morton was running down the obfcurity of her birth, I
was expatiating upon

Yes,” cried he, ** I have in

I am Surprized—astonished! Mr. Morton, to hear fuch a vile expreshon from your lips—do you confider who you are, or

Mr. Morton staid with her ladyship above an hour-—as I dare fay I was the chief topic of their conver-fation, I confeSs I was not in the least curious to know it—fortunately neither his lordship nor fon interrupted us—I had the picture now in

Mr. Morton made no reply, but taking the picture, put it into his pocket—though I did not intend to give it, yet I thought it better not to refuSe it—when I write to Mr. Chapman (as is my intention) to intercede for me, I shall beg him to get the picture back, and fend it to me.

s
My dear Charles, you must make Some apology to Mifs Mortimer for me, being thus neceshtated to dance with her ladyship—I am re-folved, however, as I know lady Melville will never have strength enough to continue long, to be my dear Alicia’s partner as foon as poshble—till then—I infist upon your dancing with Mifs Mortimer

made-up artful story, and therefore I would give no further

' DEAR SIR,
Early this morning I received
a most extraordinary letter from my Sifter—As you are principally concerned therein, I have enclofed it for your perufal.—I confeSs, though I entertain a very high opinion of my friend, that my faith was very much staggered at first—and as I thought it behoved me to discover the falfity of Lady Melville’s astertions, I went to Istington to enquire for Mr, Somers—the houfe, I perceived was stmt up, and a man who was standing at the door, told me that
he

he had ran away, and wished he was able to find him, Sor the fake of a very worthy gentleman (mentioning your name) who had often befriended and affifled him, even to his own prejudice—for, added he, the gentleman not only lent him money upon Several occafions, but was reSponfible to Some of his creditors for large fums—the villain—you now fee—is fled—^having Secretly before his departure endeavoured all in his power to hurt the character of his benefactor.-Perfectly Satisfied with this man s (lory, I returned without making further enquiries, railing at the malevolence of many existing wretches, and thinking in my own mind how eafy it is take away a character—In reSpect to my Sister’s

SIR,
NO WING you to be a particular Sriend of Mr. Morton’s, to whom I am under many obligations, and wish, if poflible, never to offend, I take the liberty of humbly addrefling you, in hopes you will confider my fituation, and by a favourable interceffion, prevail upon Mr. Morton, who is now, I fuppoSe, in Hertfordshire, to confent to my happinefs, as I muff confefs I cannot be completely happy without it.

but the
manners of a
young lady, that to live without her must make me miferable for ever! Our love is reciprocal, and it is the wish of all our friends, that we Should be Speedily united.
Mr. Morton has behaved fo unaccountably strange upon this bu-stnefs, that I must obfeiwe there is neither candour nor generolity on

You are no stranger, I fuppofe, to the unhappy altercation between Lord Eustace and his lister:—Lam accufed of what I am totally innocent;—the only method I have of vindicating myfelf is by an immediate marriage—this, it feems, will give his lordfhip ample Satisfaction, and be the means of reconciling him

but on account oS Lady Melville and her brother.

offered to encreaSe the annual do-

marriage.—It was imposhble for me, in the prefence of MiSs Franklin and her brother—for whom I entertain the most profound esteem —to declare my fentiments—they generoufly Spoke for me, and knowing the fituation of my heart, at once oppofed Mr. Morton’s request.—I am Surprized that a man

of my guardian’s experience and good fenfe, can imagine that engagements of love are fo eafily forgotten, or fo fuddenly made!-—notwithstanding, he has hinted in his letters, that he knows what the Sorrows of Love are, I must think, from his difregard to mine, that he is an abfolute stranger to them.
I wish he would once give me leave to introduce him to Mifs Mortimer

Let Mr. Morton explain the inequality let him honestly fay who I am—— and confefs the fuperiority of my parentage—till then I look upon myfelf like her—the Child of Chance and Misfortune—nor can I by destring an union with one in a Similar predicament fee any diS-grace or impropriety—Did I afpire

Per Favour of Mr* Manly,
S Mr. Manly has infilled upon my writing an anSwer to your last, which he has faithfully pro-mifed to deliver into your own hands—I am, for more reafons than one, strongly induced to
do it.

Mr. Manly has been a violent advocate for Mr. Layton.—Mrs. Percy, hearing his name mentioned, interrupted us, and begged to know how the young gentleman was? upon this the converfation improved

proved, and I was very much fur-prized to hear the old lady as lavish in praife of Frederick as his friend this encouraged Mr. Manly to proceed, and he wished to know if I had any objections to a private marriage.
Though ! entertain every refpect for Mr. Layton that is due to his merit, yet I own the question was too abrupt for a ferious reply—^be-stdes, Mr, Manly being a stranger.
I
not think it became me
to ufe too much freedom with him—I therefore fmiled, and made no anfwer.
‘‘ Believe me/* cried Mr, Manly, with energy, that Mr. Layton,
‘‘ if

FREDERICK and ALICIA; or
if not immediately made happy in his wishes, will most certainly die with grief.”

Oh! poor dear young man,’* exclaimed Mrs. Percy—“ I protest he shall not die then.—Come,

Alicia, this is a favourable opportunity to think upon fome plan for his relief—the good-natured foul—how he loves you ! yes, in the name of God, he shall be married to you—It can be done without any knowledge—you need not mention it to Mr. Stanford or Lady Melville, my dear—but I dare fay there is no danger of a vistt from the former this fome time.^—I asture you I am very
anxious

anxious about this poor fellow, and wish he may be happy.’'
‘‘ I am very glad,” rejoined Mr. Manly, that you are So propitious to the young lover’s wish—for my part, I can fee no impropriety in it, efpecially as Lord Eustace is fo destrous for the match.”
CC



Is he?”—cried the old lady with rapture—‘‘ I protest I am very ‘‘ glad of it—very glad of it.”
I now remarked the averston of Mr. Layton’s guardian to me
“ You find, Sir, (addresting Mr. ‘‘ Manly) that a , Mr. Morton— “ whom I understand Frederick is
I

quite enraged about this bufineSs; I therefore dread the evil confe-quences which may attend our connection—-believe me, Sir, my regard for Mr. Layton is Such, that I would, upon no account, be the occafion of any future unhappinefs — it feems I am thought unworthy of him^—had I been, by birth or fortune, de-ferving of his hand—how gladly would I then accept it—^but, alas 1’

THE SORROW^-'Or-
Manly to stay for dinner^the young gentleman readily complied. I could not forbear making many remarks upon Mr. Morton’s con-duSf, and what my dear friend, concerning his lordship, imparted to me.—Mr. Manly, after expatiating upon the merits of Mr. Layton which delighted the old lady exceedingly, proceeded in this manner :—
Mifs Mortimer, . I affure you I am doubly interested in this bufineSs—Love and Friendship

How, Sir!” interrupted Mrs. Percy with astonilhment—is it
‘‘ poffible!—did he want him to

Here an explanation of what you told me Succeeded—Mrs. Percy, I fuppofe on my account, was very much enraged, and declared, with a Smile of refentment, the old

gentleman s Scheme Shall be baS-

I hope So, Madam,” returned Manly with great fervency—I ‘‘ hope So—both for my friend’s fake and my own—for I confefs, Sliort as our acquaintance is, I rep'ard' Mr. Layton—I esteem

knows this young gentiemrn, the more she will admire him.
The bufineSs of Colonel Prattle was then talked of—Mr. Manly wondered where young Eustace was, as it is reported, I understand, that they went to the country together—During dinner Mrs. Percy was very curious, I thought, about Mr. Layton, and aSlc’d many inquisttive questions—indeed, both she and Mr. Manly were very urgent in his behalf.
As Mr. Manly had Some papers to look over in private, he begged leave to step to an adjacent Coffee-

I perceived Some man going into Mrs. Percy’s about two o’clock yesterday—^he came into the coffee-houfe about five, and wrote a couple of letters—I confeSs that I was very curious to know who he was, having never Seen him to my knowledge before—I afked him a

LAS ! my friend, the dreadful difcovery has happened—but the conclufion is fo contrary to our expeffations, that there is little caufe for repentance.—I did all in my power to prevent this marriage, but it feemed to be the decree of Heaven, and who could oppofe it ?
My every attempt was attended with ill fuccefs— threatened, but in vain—-I requested a meeting with Mr. Manly to communicate to Mr. Layton, what I own, my friend, I wanted courage to reveal—herein was I again dif-

My friend is already informed of
Mr. Layton’s marriage, having, as
