Dear Madam,
U R poor friend has been very
/ * < * ill for Some days. She Seems
more compoSed; but I do not like it.
It is not the compoSure ariSing from a mind at eaSe; nature rather Seems ex-haufted with affliflion. . I fear her grief will terminate in a fettled melan-
f
choly.' She neither eats, flecps, nor
fpeaks. What Surprizes me, the has
' ' »
not even mentioned Philemon for fe-
veral days.

LETTER XII.
/
Told my dear Amelia, that our journey was interrupted by the arrival of a melfenger to inform Sir Charles of, his mother’s being at the point of death. He found her fpeechr
K
lefs, and in her laft moments; a me-
*	f
lancholy reverfe to a man, who hoped to be a bridegroom before the next
I
fun Should have run his courSe. He was now a prifoner in the houSe of
death; the prifoner of decorum : for
\
he could not reltore that amiable worthy parent, or be of any Service to her cpld remains. But decency de-
manded
If

( 9° I
manded itj and as he had paid her every proper attention when living,
N
i
he would not deSert her now till he had
/
paid the laft tribute.—Yet he did not negleSl his Clara: he wrote every day, in the tendered manner, to enquire for her, and allure he.r of his regret at the cruel feparation, and even once carac incognito to pay his duty, as be called it, to his love. He had previoufly acquainted me with his intention, and begged I might be alone. You may
believe I could not refufehim. We
I
Ipent two hours in the mod tender and rapturous manner, and renewed our vows of mutual condancy. Sir Charles could not, with any degree of propriety, mention the fubjeSt of our
union,
f 91
)
/
not. ■
^nicn, and you may believe He thanked me a thoufand times for the reception I gave him, but begged he might never again receive Such a proof of my tendernefs; for I melted into tears when we met.
\
There was fomething aweful beyond
description (at leaft it appeared fo to
/
me) in the prefence of my lover. His melancholy Spread a foftneSs over his
countenance, which gave it an ineffable
)
fwcetnefs; but he appeared to my eyes like an inhabitant of another world.' Whether it was the gloom of melan-
t
choly, that like the jaundice, tinges every objeSI, or whether it was my too prophetic Spirit, certain it is, he
1	'
appeared
( 92 )
■appeared no longer my gay, my earthly lover,
I had a reyereiLtial horror upon
me at his approach. Yet iiili he was dear,

he was amiable: morO: ib, than ever-. Grief Softens and relaxes the mind: and it has' ever been re-
4*
marked by the wiieft, that the ex-
%
tremes of proSperity and adverfity are
%
favourable to love.
I know I never loved Sir Charles
%
fo well as at that period, yet he was ever approved by my heart and my reafon.
Every
thing; concurred to
O
ftrengthen my attachment to him. And I regret not my folly more for
I
ai^y caufe, than when I reflefl on my •ingratitude to his memory. Frailty! thy'
name
i 93 y
name is woman *, elSe I had never fuf-, fered any objeD to Supplant his image in'my heart. But Philemon did not Supplant it. I loved him for pretending to the yirtues Sir Charles poflelTed. I thought I found a limilarity of fenti-ments. He liftened to my tale of Sorrow. He pitied me. He adrnired— angels might have admired—the fenti-ments and exprelfions of Sir Charles.
N
My heart, prone to, or rather made
\
up of tendernefs. Seldom found an ob-jeH to wafte it on. Philemon v/as lovely; had all the arts of perfuafion* He had wit. Pic xould ahume the charaSler of virtue: He could affume it to deceive. Pie had, indeed, the

1
the reality was wanting-^I was deceiv-^

f
titious one. Too late I discovered the
*
fraud, and found myfelf a bankrupt. I had given up my all, for what ? for a deception.—Yet I could not repent.
I
I efteemed it as the moft valuable treaSure. I forgot every other conli-deration. I wafted whole days, whole months, in the contemplation of my
fancied bliSs, till I was awakened by
» ;
his perfidy. But I will Ihake off the fond, the weak, believing woman. I
will
( 95 )

will invoke the Spirits of my great fore-

fathers, and call down vengeance oh

cover me firft earth. Let me be in-

OOR, clear, amiable Clara! I feared this would be the cale. I am to blame ; yet .what could I do ? I feared a melancholy; tile DoSIor feared it. He advifed exerciSe. I
carried her to G—r. She was ever do-cile; I carried her where I pleafed. Sh^ Seemed not amuSed, but compliant.
r	^
At her defire we*went to the choir prayers. She was lifted up, and in an extafy. I hoped, idly indeed, that it would have given her mind another
turn:
( 99 )'■
i
turn ; but, Ilrange to think, every thing reminds her of her betrayer. She never Saw him in this place ; yet every objeSI preSents him to her imagination: She raved, and was quite frantic for Some little time; but her phrenzy fub-lided. She is again gentle, but disordered in her mind. She is bent on feeing him; but I cannot indulge her.
I know it would be fatal to her.
S
he
y
feared, when in' her reaSon, that die'
might make this requeft, and charged
.1 ' ' ‘ ' 1
me not to indulge her. She foreSaw
her own weakneSs, What, indeed,
\
did She not foreSee that ever befell her, except her deviation from vir-
*' i
tue ? And ftrongly urged, as flie wa‘s,' is there a human being could htive with-

flood
(

)
flood the temptation ? la my mind flie is ftill virtuous; more So than we, who have not been tempted. Her own heart, as well as her lover, in the con> f|)iracy againft her.
/
Ah! my dear Amelia, how many exult in the poITeffion of virtue, who. have not half fo much as the Self condemned Clara. She too might affume the Semblance. Her lover durft not betray her Secret. But her mind is above the appearance, where She thinks the reality exifts not.

X
Sure all man and womankind owe
. I
her candor and pity. She was ever ready to extenuate all faults but her
own.
(
101
)
own.--Of thefe, indeed,,fhe is a Severe ,,accuSer. Sure, if to judge ourfelves will mitigate pur condemnation, Clara
• will meet with pardon hereafter. I
A
•have no doubt, hut fire will. I can
If	•.	A	•
fcarce think her guilty : at leaft her
t
amiablenefs hides all ftains. There is
•V	,,	*	,	.
sfubjoined to her idea that of purity. I pannot feparate them. I never knew any that could. Her elegance and modefty always awed the licentious. How could that bafe Philemon ? My heart abhors him. If he has a heart, what mull he feel ?
I remember when I tiled to wifli for, I am afraid I ufed to envy, Clara’s at-tra8ions. How little do we know what
II 3

is for our good ? I would not feel what
* »
-Ihe does, to be empreSs of the world.
r
What would it avail me, doomed to un-
/
remitted mifery ? Sir Charles Worthy
t
was miftaken to-think her fine feelings
»
contributed to her happinels. With him, perhaps, they might; but in her prefent fituation they are to her a
4
Source of exquifite torture.
It is kind and fifierly in you to wilh to be near her. She loves you ex-
J
tremely;'but'I really do not think any
' 1
thing can mitigate her Sorrows. You may alfure yourfelf I fliall not for-
fake her, while T can be of any ufe. Could I fee her reStored to t^nquility, I Should be happy in her company.

you: but hate is fo foreign to her Ihe

Wntten a confideralle time after the

Y dear Amelia reminds me of
my promise, and of the period
at which I left Sir Charles Worthy, to
digreSs for one whom She would have
me forget. It were well if it were
poITible; but every thing in nature
forbids,it.—But I will proceed. As
foon as Sir Charles had performed
the lall fad office to the bell of women
he flew to his Clara. He did not ap

life.—7>Why Should he repine ?—Na-
\ • /
«
ture demanded a flight degree of me-
lancholy, and he'paid the tribute; but it was mixed with complacency, and,
as I faid above, almoll with chearful-nefs. His attention to me, far from

being abated by Security, was redoubled, if pofSible. He faid the
attention and alTiduity of his whole

life would be too little, to repay my

con-

condescending goodnefs in taking a part in his Sorrows, and So generoufly endeavouring — SuGceSsSulIy endeavour-

A lover oS .a leSs generous „way of thinking would have Set little value on
t
Such a conSeffion, at a time when I was ready to accompany him to the
altar. But Sir Charles Seemed to Seek
%
occafions of being grateful to his Clara, to make her forget how much She owed to him. That, indeed, was impoIEble';

tI was filent; for.he would not Suffer

„ me to interrupt or deny him, till he
I
f had urged every thing to gain my con* Sent. He faid much more—that as he could not live without feeing me, .. and hoped I did not wifh to deprive '< him of that happineSs, it would be more for my honour to confent to y tie the indiffoluble knot, on our arrival in London, and that a few months V would convince the world of the ardour , and lincerity of his paflion. He knew . too well, that I had heard many things to his disadvantage reSpeding women.
^ I

( 124 )
V
^hich
him the more earneft in
this requeft. He had befides, heard,
that it was reported he only trifled with
)
me, and Some ladies affirmed it never
i
would he a match. “ He that had
had So many affairs of gallantry with
\
women, his equals at leaf!, to be So taken with a little inexperienced girl, without guardians, almofl: her own pro-teBor, and of an uncertain, and Some laid no fortune! All the world would
N
laugh at Sir Charles. He that might have had Such matches! But it was absolutely impoffible.’*
MiKh of this had reached Sir Charles’s ears, though I was a flranger to it. He had conftantly avowed his
hon-
< •
(	125	)
honourable intentions, and Spoke in Such a ftrain as might have convinced the world of his fincerity. But malice is not eafily convinced. I Should leather fay envy; malice they could not have from any other fource ? I was then,
«	t
indeed, too juftly entitled to their envy,
but foon to be the objeD of univerfal

pity. Cruel viciffitude! Fatal reverie
of fortune! But it was my unhappy
fate ever to be within view of hap-
%
pinefs, and then to be deprived of it.
Vs
I was unable to anfwer Sir Charles

for Some time. He held my hand to
I
his bofom, and begged my confent, or to let him interpret my Silence as a confent to his propofal. I was obliged
tel.,	r
to
( «26 )
to Speak, left he Iliould, - he Said,'
f
interpret my Silence in his favour. I found it hard, indeed, to refuSe him any thing; but, at the Same time, thought there was an impropriety iri his requeft. ' I was convinced he thought So too by the many arguments he uSed to perfuade me to it. I told him my opinion. He Said, whatever impropriety there might be in his urging me to conSent to a private mar-
riage, it was to avoid more disagree^
/
able circumftances, that might poflibly
I.
attend delaying our union.

He Said every thing that his or his wit could Suggeft, and prevailed Iq far, that I promiSed him an anSwer

Am haftening, my Amelia, to a period, which I once thought the moft dreadful of my life. I idly imagined at that time, it was out of the power of fate to affliD me more fe-verely, and that adverfe fortune had emptied all her quivers in my bofom. Perhaps I am ftill to endure more exquifite woes. Perhaps the meafure
of my fufferings is not yet full. Shall

in comparifon to what you now fulfer ?

Perhaps there are beings, ftill more wretched. I can Scarce think it pofr
fible. But it may yet be the will of

It was difBcuIt for me to refuSe Sis
ny requeft, but I looked on
his, laft as an unreasonable one. I
thought he Iliould have waited patiently

Indeed I could Scold you, as I once ufed to do —Ah, my Clara, ShaH thofe happy days ever return!—for acculing yourfclf in the manner you do. Had Sir Charles, dear Sir Charles, had he
died of that fever, you could not, with

beginning, but did not perceive it till
too, too late.
Philemon was playful as infancy,
and feemed as innocent. Good God S
What a talk have I undertaken! No,
it is impoflible to relate the arts, by
which I was rendered miserable pall

'A
Dear Madam,
; '
XT" OUR poor Clara is no more.
To me file bequeathed the me-
/
lancholy tafk of finilhing her truly un-fortunate hiftory. I am unable to do it, for I loved her tenderly. She de-
4
ferved it. She was amiable and gentle; always ready to forgive every one but herfelf. Her laft breath was fpent in a prayer for him, who not only ruined and deceived her, but ufed her mott inhumanly.
\
/

a
( io6 )
humanly. She never could be pre

vailed on to mention his real name.
I have known her long. I ever

found her truly virtuous, the moil dc--
A
licate and modell of her fex. But
even ansels have fallen.
feemed
/
even after her fall, to have all the
>
purity of one. I am fure her eyes
never were dry for two hours tOr

'	r
gether fince Ihe came into this re-
tirement.
)
Yet the endeavoured to conceal
r
her griefs from me, becaufe I was too
much affecled and afflifled by theray
When alone, ihe was conftantly upon
her
!U'.

■i.
if
\
( 107 )
her knees; and when I fat with her.
fhe would frequently forget herfelf, and
utter an ejaculation. She ufed fomc-
times to attempt to work, but could
not attend to either that or reading,
unlefs fhe got Ibme book which gave
a vent to her tears. Then Ihe would
read for hours. But fhe was never
tired of writing, and feemed to be
forry to meet with any interruption.
though fhe burned more than half of
what fhe wrote.
I never faw any perfon fb devout.
without the leafl: tinge of fuperftition.
She often read over the. funeral fer^-
vice; and when fhe came to that part.
Lor
I
J
(	108 )

For I believe that my redeemer liveth:
' j	•	•
She would fay, “ Indeed I believe it,
4
“ and that belief has reftored me to
“ my fenfes, and kept me fo long in
\
“ this vile world. But my life, at laft,
I
“ mull end, my dear, dear Fidelia. “ Suppofe I Should live fifty years. It “ is terrible, indeed, to think of it, “ But every day, every moment, takes “ off a grain at leall of the dead load
“ that weighs me down to earth.
_ ____________________________ ^
“ When all thefe earthly particles are

worn away, I Ihall afeend my

Then fhe would ftart
' and flaudder, and fay, “ Can “ tion afeend ?’*
I cn-
( 109 )

I
I endeavoured, you may believe, to comfort her. Indeed I wanted comfort mvfelf: for fhe has made me

look with indifference on every thing
f
in. this life, and with abhorrence on mankind. I could dwell for ever on

this fubjefl, but muft draw towards the too melancholy catallrophe.
4
She wrote almoft to the laft, and has left rpe little farther to fay; yet I am unable to fay. it. I think flic was very well affured of her approaching end, though flic appeared more chear-ful and compofed than I had ever feen
X	-	‘

Ah!

Ah! madam, we can both remember when fhe was all gaicfe de ccturt
) ' ■ ■
when it was impoffible tQ be dull or ill tenipered in her company.. She was the envy of her own, and the admiration of the other fex. Good
\
God! to think fhe fhould be cut down - like a lily in all her lovehnefs! Her bloom returned a few days before her death. Indeed file fcarce ever looked more beautiful. She feemed to have Heaven in her afpeff. Yet fhe would often drop a tear, though ap*
patently compofed.
You know what lovely eyes fhe had. They were brilliant to the laft, - Her
voice
/

voice waJ-Iweeter and more plaintive than the fong of Philomel. How
I
many have I heard fay, in the days when fhe was beloved and admired,
I
that that foftnefs of accent touched
*
their hearts more than her beauty. Indeed fhe was truly lovely in mind
s
and body. But what avails it ? She is mingled with the dufti Even her
i
name is unknown in the Spot where her
/
poor relicks lie. Had I the talents oF
a PopCj or her beloved Littleton, I
%
would celebrate her memory in never
I
dying verSe.

Have I not faid enough ? Mull I dcfcribe a fcene impoflible for me to

O U fee, my dear madam, wfiat *•" an unhappy fate that of our poor
f
injured Clara was. Yet Ihe appeared
: ^ '
more compofed and ferene, than I fear Ihe really was. I was all along convinced, before I read her letter,
that her paflion was unabated. Never
¥
female heart was fo fteady both in
love and friendihip. I have fuffered fb much for her, that my health and
gaiety

gaiety are both impaired. Yet Ihe wa&

once the life of every one who con-
I
verSed with her. ^

I could not have believed, that any misfortune could fo fuddenly change
I
nature. Indeed her heart was ftill

the mild, tender and compaffionate.
... ' •»
’ It vas that gentlenefs, that made it

prey upon itfelf. She gave her for-
f *
rows no vent, but in tears. I ob-
* «
Served her health decline, and the rofes quit her lovely cheeks, long be-fore Philemon forfook her. I knew
not the caufe at that time, but ufed
to rally her on her pehliveneSs, and

She complained, which very much
furprized me, of the precarious fitua-
'
tion i'of her fortune^ and feemed to
• V.	^
walk for riches. No woman ever delpifed them more, or was of a more
generous
Yet She did
I
not dmemble; She really wilhed for * them. Philemon had been extrava-' vagant, and wanted fortune to put his>

affairs on a refpeSlable footing. She* retrenched all her expenceSj and de--
prived herfelf of every elegancy, for which .fhe had formerly fo great a
