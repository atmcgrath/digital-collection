I look on it that we are born in pairs, and it is absolutely neceffary that the two halves ihould meet to form a proper union; it is the vulgar, the indelicate notion that the difference of fex, and equality of fortune and family are the only re-quifites to constitute the tye, that caufes fo much infelicity, that degrades the inllitution, and furnifhes fo much employment for the prodlors in Doctors Commons. But I feldom declare myfelf on the fubjeft, ■ for to talk to the principle part of the world on the congeniality of fouls, would be unintelligible as to harangue a man born blind, on the beautiful variety of colours, and gradation of Shades in the bow of Iris.—But you will ex-peft Some account of the fair lady,

OUR letter has, I confeSs, given
me great unealineSs, you Say Colonel Richly is in love with you; but I, my friend, have made a greater discovery—you are as much in love with him in reality, as he is with you in appearance; be neither furpriSed nor offended, my dear, at my doubting his fmcerity;—it is no disparagement to your charms, which you muff expert

will gain you many admirers;—but I am always inclined to Sufj^^edt Such precipitate' declarations, eSpecially from, men of gallantry, who,, as MiSs Walter obferves, make it a pradtice to every lady they are in company with.—I do not apprehend this is the cafe at pre-fent,—I am convinced there is fome-thing more than mere gallantry in this alfair, but; I could have wifhed my

without knowing it yourSelf, that MiSs^ Walter is not only unworthy your friend-Ihip, but even your flighteft notice. She has certainly mean Sentiments and haughty manners; perhaps thefe are not her greatell faults.—Now, my dear, if you can be thus eafily impofed on by an acquaintance, with your eyes open, have I not reafon to fear you may be deceived when blinded by love;—but this deception is far more fatal than the other*, be on your guard, I intreat you, my Lucy; was you indifferent, I Should not in the leaf! fear the propriety of your coi> dudt, but as this is not the cafe, there is a neceffity of diflimulation, which I know will fit as awkwardly on you, as our modern flays would on Some belle fauvage—-be particularly careful ofMifs

I made no doubt, but Clara was engaged to her lover, and readily consented, to be Lord Landmore’s partner, who was of our party—and when Mr. Beaumont hoped I was disengaged, I concluded he had promised me to one of his acquaintance, and with an air of gaiety, replied in

Not as when my dear father pleafed himfelf in improving every fpot. I paffed too, Clara, by the church where my father and my Scarce remembered mother lie intered; ah why, faid I, burlling

But theSe apprehenfions were Soon at an end. She was delivered of another girl; which, as no rival for the eflate, my papa was perfe(ftly fa-tisfiecl with, and allured his wife lire fliOLild have no reafon to complain of his behaviour to her little Fanny j for though he felt a great partiality for his Emilia, he would as much as poflible conceal it, and carry the balance with an even hand. And indeed my filter had a very confiderable lhare in his

When I was about ten years old, a Mr. Gerrard, a firll coufin of my mothers, came to Spend’ a Summer with our family; he was an agreeable young man, but he had rather imbibed too diffipated a manner, from being in London, where he ftudied the law: however, he fooii became reconciled to our regular way of life, and diverted himSelf with partaking of my father’s rural' Sports, and playing with us children, of whom he Was very fond : but it was a more tender engagement that caufed this Sudden alteration in hrs tafte; he had at church Seen a Nancy Emer-fon, daughter to the clergyman of the village ; his heart, a Ilranger to love, liirrendercd at one view of this lovely

The old man encouraged him for interest, and his wife from ill-nature, as She' faw how diSagreeable he was to poor Nancy, who with much difficulty prevented his making pro-pofals to her father. The lovers found they had no time to lofe, and every thing was agreed on for their flight;—^^but their evil genius had
been too bufy in preventing it;—Mrs,

The old miSer, alarmed at this intelligenee, wrote to his Son, comr" manding him to Set out for London immediately, on an affair of conSe-quence y adding, by way of inducement, it would detain him but a. few days—he alSo fent a letter to Mr. Emerfon, advifing him to take care of his daughter, for he was certainly informed, that his fon* had an intention to ruin her, by means of a iham marriage ;—and it was. too probable, from his libertine principles. This Scheme fucceeded but too welh. My eoufin, on the receipt of his order, flew to find his Nancy ; he even difobeyed his father, in waiting, a day, to take leave of his beloved miftreSs. But in vain did he wait. She was not

She could not with Hand his perfua* lions, and after his departure, fent me with a fervant, on fome meffage, to Mr. Emerfon; but I was not permitted to fee Nancy, who was confined to her apartment, and perpetually upbraided for her imprudence ; Mr. Gerrard’s letter was produced as a proof of her lover’s bad intentions ; at the- fight of the contents, fhe fainted ; on her recovery, her father, at his wife’s inftigation, told her, the only reparation Ihe could make, was by giving her hand to Mr. Felton, which, if fhe refuSed to do, he would abandon her to her Seducer, with his

This affair was kept So private, that nobody had the lead: fuSpicion; the evening before, my mamma, happening to fee a boy belonging to Mr. Emerfon, gave him the letter, and told him ta give it to his young miflrefs, the firft opportunity : he obeyed her but too pund:ually, and delivered it immediately on her return from church,—^

Yes, Beaumont, I am Villers, the happy Villers, the lover; ah, let me fay, die favoured lover of MiSs Wat-fon, I have received letters from England, that give me pretenlions, to aliert my claim in the face of the world. You are amazed; why change my name ? you Say, Love, love my friend, the ruling paffion ! DiflreSfed at the discouraging letters, I received from my filler, I determined to come diSguiSed to England; and, by Some means, procure an interview with my

This was a romantic Scheme, and a

letter I received from Emma, made it appear So ungenerous, that I delayed putting it in execution, though I ftill retained the name, which, at quitting Venice, I had allumed with that delign; in caSe any new inducement Should again tempt' me to renew it.
Think, Beaumont, how your firff letter tortured me; I could not fup-poSe you could behold my Clara with indifference; nor could- I hope the remembrance of her Villers, could Support her conftancy, when attacked by Mr. Beaumont,

Harley has^ long fince been rejedted. But, indeed, you have received more encouragement, than could have been expedted, - from a mind So timidly delicate as hers, and So circumftanced.

In my lad, I informed you of die lituation in which I left the unfortunate Agnes. A few WTeks after, my Servant waked me early in the morning,

The very day after you left us, the Marquis returned, and urged my father to let the marriage be immediately concluded: He readily consented, and told me, to be ready on to-morrow, to give my hand to the Marquis.

(inclosed in the PRECEEDING.)
W^ITH a heart Hill trembling at
the dangerous lituation, to which her imprudence reduced him, the unfortunate Agnes, on her knees, implores the pardon, of the moft amiable, moll injured of men. Thofe knees,
on
142 THE MAIDEN AUNT.
on which, fince the fatal accident, Ihe has incelTantly, with uplifted hands, and ftreaming eyes, poured, out her ardent Applications for his recovery. And, to render thofe Applications more acceptable, folemnly dedicated her future days to that Being, who alone could fave her from the horror of occafioning the death of him, for whom Ae would, with pleafure, re-hgn her life.
Heaven, which faw the lincerity of my vow, accepted the unworthy offering, and mercifully reftored you to my prayers ; how fmall the facriiice!
how great the recompenSe ! In this
«
afylum, to which I fled at that dif-tradting event, which I Audder to recall.

call, do I fix for ever; and devote my life, to penitence, praiSe, and prayers. A night atonement for the errors of my pafl; conduct. Errors of the moft dangerous kind. Errors, whofe consequences might have made me the moll wretched of human beings. Never can I be enough grateful to the Providence which preServed you, for, I hope, many years of uninterrupted felicity.
My father, to whom I wrote, approves my intention of retiring from a
world where, he fays, I can never

place where I can hope for peace; a ray of comfort already beams upon my foul, which can only hope to regain its former tranquility, by fixing all its defires and affedtions on that being, from whom an earthly, though innocent pafiion, had too long eftranged it.

St. James’s-ftreet,
O R Shame, for fliame, Emma L I could not have believed you could have been So perverSe y I have absolutely no patience with you; Mrs. Del main and Lucy are too indulgent by half; had I the management of you, I would allow none of the whims and vapours; they have fpoiled you

quite a pett, and cry and teaze your-

Self Sor you know not what.
But the pretty dear’s pride is hurt, fhe is humbled forSooth—humbled that Ibe has betrayed a partiality for a man whoSe love is (now pride Smart) an honour to her. SeriouSly though Emma, I muSl have this growing petulance checked—I cannot part with the Smalleft decree of that fweetneSs
o
which rendered you the darling of your friends^—you fay, “ Heaven make me worthy the moil amiable of
men.

that wilh, even you, good as you are, have no Superfluous merit—the man, my dear, is a prodigy as times go; he is one of thoSe who does not uSe virtue as a cloak to his faults, but carefully conceals his virtue under an appearance of gaiety and vivacity
I.
but I know no theme fo pleafing to a love-fick damSel, as the exploits of her hero; fo will give you the particulars of the affair that makes me fa fluent in my encomiums.
I don*t know whether you obferved
a genteel Servant Mifs Beaumont hired
fince we came to London; I have
• ^
often Seen her fince you left me, and
found
28
THE MAIDEN AUNT.
found Something in her appearance So much above her flation, as engaged my notice. Her perSon, which She ftrives to conceal in a habit remarkably plain, is Ilrikingly elegant, but' fo exceffively thin, that Ihe leems-rather an aerial being than a fub-Itance-—her face is fine, wdth the llrongefi: exprelfion of fenfibility I ever faw, but clouded with a melancholy that mu ft be the refult of the deepeft defpair; and the languid hue of her complexion, difcovers a conftitution finking under the pangs of filent grief.
You know enough of Letitia, my dear Emma, to be fenfible fhe is not

one of the kindeft miftrelTes, but will
be Sorry to hear She could be cruel
#
enough, to try to heighten the diftreSs of a woman, who was plainly in a fituation to which Ihe had not been ufed. I have been feveral times fhocked at her inSulting behaviour before me, which poor Julia evidently flruggled to bear with humility; I
have thought Sometimes ihe would have fainted, I alked Letitia Several times where fhe met with her maid, and if fhe knew any thing of her family } fuppreffin

Once or twice I attempted to enter into conversation with Julia, but Ihe declined it with a reSpeftful humility—my
looks feemed to abalh her. I could not tell how to proceed, I pitied
her fate and wifhed to relieve her, but how was the difficulty.

In about half an hour, Beaumont

for that unhappy girl, that Mifs WatSon will forgive the liberty I have taken, in ufing her name, to aflill an objedt whofe delicacy might have been alarmed at any offers of Service from me.”—I told him he could not have obliged me more, that I had long been interefted in Julia’s affairs, and only wilhed an opportunity to be her friend; I then alked where Ihe was, as I was certain he could inform me. “ I do not deny
it, replied he—^when I left the room,

the age of thirty, was at the head of
a company; but his father then dying,

Soon; after he married my mother, poffelfed of every requilite to happi-nefs but a fortune—with her he lived but a few years—a wound he received in an engagement deprived us of our Support—I was then about four years of age—his difconfolate widow immediately wrote to an elder lifter in more prosperous circumftances, acquainting her of hex misfortune,"and received a letter of kind eondplance, her to fettle her affairs as foon as pof-iible, and come to her,' who Ihe

I was brought up at her houSe,

and received my education from the fame mailers who attended my coulin. LouiSa was three years older than me, of a haughty, aflliming temper, im-patient of controul—my diSpoIition being of the oppolite kind, I found no difficulty in yielding up every point to avoid contention ; my mamma, to

At this hofpitable manfion, the

how is that SenSe of gratitude and reSpedt increaSed to the high eft filial affection, by a more intimate acquaintance with her goodneSs.—Nothing but this duty, and my impatience to behold a beloved fifter, could have made me neglect the calls of friend-
ftiip; as to MiSs Watfoh, I had predetermined to proceed in a regular way, by fir ft applying to her
A
father, whatever the delay might coft my heart;—however, I have fince changed my plan and intend to accept his invitation, (ah, was it poffi-ble to refufe) and at Wood-park, where firft my love commenced, bring it to a happy period. Nothing could

exceed the tender meeting between me and my filter, I thought fhe would have fainted in my arms, while, with equal delight, I Itrained her to my bofom. With what pleaSure do I view the improvements, three years has made on this lovely girl; you, Beaumont, will fargive a doating brother’s pride, Ihe is the darling of all her friends ; Mrs. Delmain loves her with a mother’s fondnefs—who can help it, fuch a pleafing perfon, fuch a gentle-nefs of manners, and fuch an obliging difpofition !•—you will be one of the happielt of men—I fliould have faid the happielt, but that my felicity, pofiTefled of my Clara, cannot be exceeded.

To acquaint you, madam, wi’tb the fird;' Source from whence this extraordinary eircumdance has arifen,

I omitted mentioning hitherto, becaufe I conlidered it as a matter of no importancer le was only this; that the other day Mr» Francis Beaumont having paid me one of thofe vilits of gallantry which I eoimplained of, accidentally dropped from his pocket as he pu-lled out his handkerchief, a note, without any fignature, the purport of which was> to invite him to an aflignation, as I fuppofed, with a young lady at a particular hour; as the time was elapfed that day, I did not chufe to let him’ know I had found his billet (which
indeed:.
THE MAIDEN AUNT. indeed, had it not been already broken

curiolity to examine) and' So without fliewing it to any body, I deftroyed it, being perSuaded, that old love-letters, like old almanacks, bein
out of date, there would be an end of
%
the matter.-
Mr. Beaumont, however, as it feems, being of a very forgetful nature, having loll this billet,, millook the hour of appointment; which wa& intended, however, and understood by both parties that it was not for that day, but for the next, which was Fridayand, as the conftant day of the-

parties meeting,, was not Specified in the paper. The coiiScquence of this forgetfuliiels was likely to have proved fatal to the young gentleman ; and, on. Ills vifit to the writer of it, he unfortunately met with a brother of her’s, a native of Ireland, with whom en-
4
countering, he was wounded,, and now lies dangeroully ill at the houfe of one Mr. Frampton, a- near friend of his,, with whom every one here is quire unacquainted.

IN C E your little excurSion from Wood Park, my dear Sir, I am Sorry to inform you, that your worthy friend Mr. Beaumont, has been attacked with an illnefs which alarms every one here prefent, and which may be prefumed to be owing partly to the delay of his
own happinefs with his intended bride,
and
THE MAIDEN AUNT. igi
and partly to the dangerous fituation in which his brother Itill languilhes, who may probably ftill pay with his life for his love of pleaSure and intrigue.
You have heard, that to oblige Mifs Villers and Mr. Henry Beaumont, I have interelled myfelf greatly
\
in the recovery of this unfortunate young man *, lince the illneSs of your friend, I have redoubled my affiduities, and cannot but be under great concern for his prefent unhappy condition.
Notwithllanding all his brother’s love and mine, however, this young
gentleman

We know no more than tliat he fought, and for a woman; the reft remains a Secret, locked up in his own breaft, or communicated to Mr. Frampton only.

that ever entered into the nuptial hate;

may they, (as I doubt not but they will) ever celebrate this anniverSary as the begining of their felicity.—-It was with great difEculty, the young people carried their point, to have the marriage private—Emma’s heart

was quite Set on it—and Mr. Beaumont, to oblige her, took great pains to bring over the reft; he at laft, Succeeded, and in conSequence of it, we
paired the day delightfully.
MiSs WatSon with all her fine Spirits, did not behave half So well, as our gentle Emma, who was charmingly compoSed; and was an excellent pattern for her friend, who was rather filly on the occafion;—their dreSs was exactly alike; fine DreSden mullins, white fattin ftippers, point linen, elegant morning caps, and chip-hats.—MiSs Beaumont and I, were' ^iCarly attired in the fame manner. ■

Before tea, Mr. Beaumont, and Mr. Villers, entertained us with their

An engagement was immediately

Mr. Beaumont, and Mr. Villers, took their brides by the hand, the reft followed their example, and we had an agreeable dance on a fine lawn, till Supper, which was Served up with the greateft elegance;—and it was late before we quitted a place, where the hours paffed fo delightfully.
I have faid nothing about Settlements; —we have hardly heard of them, every thing has been conduced fo quietly, and the generofity of all parties left no room for difpute.
