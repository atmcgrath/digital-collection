6 The Journey to London.
“ London: to be Sure, as th^y have “ lived there So long, they can tell me about the fashions, and every thing.”
Mrs. Selby Smiled at her daughter’s cagerneSs: she felt no Small Satisfadlion sherSelf at the very idea of viSiting a Baronet’s Lady. Mr. Selby had, it is true, an independent fortune; yet it was not a large-one : he, therefore, though of a benevolent, hoSpitable dif-poSition, was willing to live in a retired manner, that he might be able to Save Something for his daughters, as his real estate would deScend to his Son: he choSe alSo to make Some provifion for his wife, though he had married her without any money. She was the daughter of a merchant, Settled in a country-town, where he had been upon Some
buSineSs; and he happened to take-a
fancy

fancy to her, as she was, at that time, in the eyes of most people, a very pretty woman. She was, indeed, at the commencement of this narrative, not in the least diSagreeable in her per-Son. Her retired; tranquil life, from tlie time of her marriage, having greatly contributed to the preservation of her , health, and the uniform flow' of her ■ Spirits, in conSequence of which she had a blooming complexion, and a brilliancy to a pair of as beautiful eyes iis were
ever placed in a human head. With
/
theSe perSonal advantages,'she was certainly qualified to make no bad figure at the Baronet’s houSe; and she was ssattered enough by them' to believe, that file should not be eclipSed by, her ow.T daughters, who were generally called very fine girls. They were, indeed, tall and strait ; they had clear,

Their brother was alSo well-made, and had, in his agreeable, manly countenance, SenSibility strongly ex-pressed. His father, willing to give him every opportunity of improving the talents nature had bestowed on him,-had Sent him to - Cambridge, that he might be qualified, by an univerfity education, for ecclefiastical preferment, should he happen to have a call to the church. With regard to his daughters, he did not want them to poS-feSs any other qualifications than thoSc which might tend to make them good wives and good mothers, to the men. who should chuSe to paSs their lives with them.

I
would mind what they were about adding, that she had herSelf married with nothing; and that though she might have perhaps done better, there were women, who had married; worfe,.
Mrs. Selby having been long weary of a retired- life, was Secretly as much rejoiced at the intelligence communicated^ to her by her daughter, as she appeared' to be, though she had every rational
amuSement at her command. Tlie

There was alSo a good deal of land round it.

of flowers and flirubs, for the enter-

Mr. Selby had alSo a good collecftioii
of books: he was not a man of the
$
world, but he was a man of fenSe, and had received the best School-learnino:
o
the country could afford. In the younger part of his fife he had been a great lover of reading, and had a taste for muSick, Sufficient to enable him to a-muSe himSelf with playing a little upon the organ and violin, both, which instruments he retained in his houSe: though*

after his children grew up, he Seldom meddled with, them, devoting his whole time and attention to“ the improvement of his Small fortune, for the Sake of his familyi However, as his Son and younger daughter had often importuned him to.'instru61: them in a Science which "	B 6	ptO“

promised to afford them much plcaSure, having both a particular passion for mu^ fick, and melodious voices, he now and then gave them a lesson upon the organ ; but he cautioned them, at the Same time, not to apply cloSely. to mufick, lest they might be prevented by it from paying their attention to things of more conSequence. Fanny, notwithstanding
her father’s precaution, would Some^
times Sing, though rudely, while her brother accorhpanied her upon the or* gan; and they Sometimes joined in a duet. The two girls alSo drew well enough to Save the expences of patterns-for Working aprons, rushes, &c. &c. TheSe amuSements, with vifits to the few neighbours they had, kept them from growing melancholy in their re-tirernent. Their neighbours were most ' of them chearfulj good-natured, people,

and Such people, though not very highly polished, are a thouSand times more valuable than thoSe who, with the most re- ' fined accomplishments, have had their minds corrupted by an imitation of the manners of the fashionable world.
With the young and lively part of their neighbours, the MiSs Selbys Sometimes Schemed a dance, and Sometimes planned other amuSements, in order to fill up their vacant hours in a winterevening, innocently. Cards were absolutely banished from their little Social meetings. Cards, indeed, were particularly discouraged by Mr. Selby him-Self: he never played, neither at home or abroad; and as he had many reasons to disapprove of their being introduced into his family, he always in-
I
yeighed warmly against them. He never

They alSo give too great a Spur to the passions, and excite many of the most destructive kind, eSpe-eialiy avarice. There k Sufficient rea-fon to believe that the love of play opens the door to many low arts, and shabby proceedings diSgraceful, to man, and detrimental to Society.
, In conSequence of theSe capital ob-jefbions to card-playing, Mr. Selby took every possible method to prevent his children from contracting an inclination Sor it; and was, indeed, extremely Solicitous to cure them of every the llight-cst folly to which they were naturally addicted, or which they had caught by

However, though the young Selbys were thus diScreetly brought up, though they were never checked by any unreasonable restraints, and- though they shared in all the pleaSures of the country, there were So many things which tliey had not Seen, which- they had heard of, and of whicst they wanted to hear more, that they were delighted at the coming do-wn of a family from London; not in the least doubting but that they could give them all the wished-for, information-.

The Journey to London,
Mr. Selby, during the above dialogue, was looking over his men at work upon', his land. WhCxT he came in to dinner, net Seeing his wife and daughters dreffed-in- any way as if they were going abroad,, he concluded they had,, on Second' thoughts,, prudently laid their Scheme. aSide. After having fat Some time without hearing any mention of the intended vifit,, he Said, good-naturedly,, to his wife—“So, my 'dear, you do> not purpofe going to Sir Thomas’s,, I fee.”

“ Yes indeed, I do,” replied she,, rather Serioufiy; then looking; down, as iS thoroughly mortified at her disappointment, she added— “ but they are engaged to-day,”

As to Mrs. Selby, she was by no means like her daughters, with regard to their wishes to imitate their new acquaintance : she returned, indeed, with a strong averSion to every thing she met with at home, and with a Superlative contempt for her hushand ; but she believed —for the Lumleys, while they won her money, were particularly civil to her—^that she made as good a figure ' as Lady Lumley herSelf did, if not a better one: and with reSpedl to her dreSs and her houSe, she was determined tO’'-make them both as like the above-mentioned Lady’s as poshble.

This delire, however, was not, she knew; to
be gratified till she got to London,

where she intended to Spend the winter. Tlie vast encomiums on the metropolis, wliich she had heard from her ne-iv neighbours, and the accounts which they had given her of the people of rank and fa-shion there, of the perpetual amuSe-ments, and of the various plea-

While Fanny was in this fituation ; while Such reflections as theSe took poS-Seflion of her mind, Lumley, though not quite fatiated, was, by no means. So eager as he was before. He liked Fanny as a mistreSs, becauSe he knew that She was fond of him alone; and yet condudled herSelf with a delicacy not to be met with in the common run of kept mistrestes : he was therefore very willing to be connedled with her in that way, but grew more and more determined to listen to no other.

By this behaviour he made her hope that stie might still gain her point, though Ihe fo fincerely repented of not having obtained it at first, that fhe could not have any rest.

strove to conceal the anxiety She endured, in conSequence of her apprehenSions; but to no purpoSe : it was, in Spite of all her care, perceived, and by the very perSon least pleaSed with it; by Lumley, who now, as fhe not only looked unhappy every time he Saw her, shut

Maria had none of her fister’s tender fenfations ; stie liked to be admired, but she troubled herfelf very little about being beloved. She .was exceedingly delighted with dreSs, and with parade of every kind. Provided she was fine, and-made a brilliant appearance^ she was •fatisfied. She had no idea of Sitting down contented with the man of her heart, in an elegant retreat, like her fister. Had she married the most amr-able man in the world, she, most pro-r shably, would have left him the next moment to go in Search of another as amiable.
She could not bear any Sort of confinement : she was perpetually hurrying from place to place in quest of, what is called, PleaSure and her taste for diffi-

Charles had a confiderable share in it ; but this addition to the troubles of the family fo difgufted Maria, that while t/oey were grieving for her fister, she, unobserved, packed up her own cloaths, and the best .which belonged to Fanny, and made off.
Mrs. Selby, who had not discovered
more concern for Fanny than Maria had, was, at the Same time, engaged in writing a letter to Captain.Dermot, to acquaint him with ali her grievances, and to let him know, that she should be the most miserable creature upon earth, if she was obliged to go and live in the
country. She concluded with a broad hint, strongly fignifying, that it would-be more agreeable to her to remain in
London, if she could meet wdth any

Maria, in her flight from home, met George Lumley coming out of a bagnio.

Mr. Selby was extremely shocked to hear his daughter talk in this way; he forced her, however, into a coach, carried her home, and locked her up, till he went down to the farm.
When Fanny’s funeral was over,
Mr. Selby put Maria into a coach with her mother, (who received not a fingle hint of conSolation from Captain Dermot before stie Set out). When he got down to his farm, he diSpoSed of ~a great part of his estate, paid all his wife’s debts, and Settled what remained on his Son, that he might be able to pay Sally Cox—for fo he ever called it — her allowance. By proceeding in this manner, Mr. Selby made Such a redustion of his income, that Mrs. Selby was obliged to be content with the bare necessiiries of life, instead of

the many comforts she enjoyed before she became defirous of imitating Lady Lumley.

As to, Lady Lumley, she and her family were far from being happy. Sir Thomas, by his return to London that winter, which had proved So unfortunate to the Selbys, had Spent all, and more than he had Saved in his Summer-retreat. He was, therefore, driven to a Small estate he had near the Land’s End. •—There he and his family were necessitated, urged by ceconomicai motives, to Spend the remainder of their days. In that retirement the MiSs Lumleys became old w^omen without being wives, having neither fortunes nor charasters to recommend them. The eldest Son, the Seducer of poor Fanny Selby, had it no longer in his power to boast of any '	conquests

conquests of that kind, or to triumph over the expiring virtue of any other fond female, as the wound which he had received from Charles Selby had entirely disabled him from having any farther
amorous connestions with the. fair fex, to whom his brother fell a martyr in another manner.,
\
Maria Selby asted in the way she intended: eluding all her father’s vigilance, she returned to-London, became a common prostitute, and died in a coui-
dition, too shocking to be deScribed.
