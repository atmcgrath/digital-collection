PREFACE.
H E N I attempt to interest an impartial Public in favour of the following Work, it is not from a vain hope, that it is defer\dng of the approbation of the judicious.—No, my hopes are better founded: a candid, a liberal, a generous Public, will make the necefSary allowances, for the JirJi attempt of a young female Adventurer in Letters.

[ vi ]
But what fhall I Say to the meer Critic ? confcious as I am of the deficiency of my literary abilities, I fhall, with all due fubmiSlion, kifs the rod in filence : I will thank the hand that points out my errors, and endeavour to profit by the admonition.
All I intreat of thofe who may think it worth their while to form a judgment of the following Work, or, who may be inclined to criticife on it, is, that they will recall to their remembrance the motive that first induced the undertaking : that of holding out a good Example to my female readers.
If the Example be confidered as a piece of painting; it will, I fear,
fall
[ vii ]
fall even below criticifm: it wants,' l am very fenfible, warmth of colouring, contrast of character, and the advantage of light and stiade. So estential to the finished Picture. To this, indeed, the Authorefs does not arrogate a pretenfion: how far a generous encouragement from the Public may foster her genius, and give glow and warmth to her imagination, or richneSs and colouring to her pencil—time must prove. At prefent, stie only pretends, to have attempted to place a female Character in a variety of fituations ; every one of them, probable, (for stie disclaims the outre., however it might heighten the painting) in thefe fituations. She hopes the Heroines ’ conduct will appear examplaryl
How

How well thefe hopes are foun-. ded, find how far her attempts may Succeed; She waits in most respectful, but anxious Silence, for the determination of the Public.

I HAVE received your letter, and Sincerely feel for your distreSs of mind, whatever may be the cauSe.
I dare not condemn you for your re-•fcrve—becauSe I have not been unde* ,	Serving of blame for a Similar condu(5l.
—-When I affirm, that my most heartfelt friendship cannot be lessened by any thing in your power to communicate,—do not imagine that it is to induce yoir to Satisfy an idle curioSity— A passion but too justly attributed to
our

But to give you the most convincing proof what my opinion is, I will, with the most perfect unreServe, open my whole heart to you, which will fully explain why I quitted your ho:^itaBle manSion in St. James*s-street; and then you yourSelf shall judge, v/hether you ought either to fetition or fmon^ Jlrate,
B 3	The

The greatest breach of friendship to you, and of the laws of impartiality, witstreSpetfi to miy hushand, has been Screening my own errors under the paltry Subterfuge of concealing i?/r, when I fear 1 shall be the Sufferer when you draw a comparison in our chara(5l:crs.— Colonel Morley, who I must always call father, and wsho has been truly Such to me, and his daughter Delia, are just arrived'—A viSit I by no means expedt.^ ed—I could have diSpenSed with their company, as it will oblige me to keep you in a state of fuSpenSe until the next post,—by which conveyance, if nothing unforeseen prevents, there shall not remain an adlion of my life, or a thought of my heart, worth Seciti-ng, unknown to you.-----Adieu !

(in continuation.)
Delia being fatigued with her journey, requested permission to lie down— and my Sather having letters to write, enables me, contrary to my expeDations, to purSue my intentions.
Though I have always declined entering into any particulars of my life, fearful that the true account of my con-dud, might occaSion a change in your Sentiments towards me ;——Yet I remember to have told you, that my Sifter and myfelf went over to Bengal,, with my mother and Colonel Morley (her Second hushand), when we were mere children—but for farther particulars relative to them, I shall refer you to the History of her Own Life, which,, as Soon as my things are cleared from the India HouSe, I will Submit to your peruSal.—It likewiSe contains Some ad-B 4	vice

vice—that her discernment SoreSaw I should stand in much need of—and I fear you v/iil judge by my condiKst, that I have little regarded itbut ir is fit her revered memory should have juS-tice done ir, though I shall Suffer in your esteem.
V	My m-other was not only celebrated
' for her beauty and delicacy of form— but for the more lasting perfedlions of a good understanding, and a benevolent heart;—her gentlenefs of diSpofi-tion too often interfered with parental authority, and we regarded her more as a friend than a rpother.
My Sister, who was two years older than mySelf, and who was at that time the admiration of the whole faftory for her beauty and accomplishments. Selected Major ForteScue from the rest of her lovers, as one deServing of her preference.
[	9	]
ference. The whole study of my mother’s life was to promote the happineSs of her children, and she recommended him to my father, as a very proper match for Nancy.
He accepted the propoSal, and they were married. As our tempers never .agreed, and I was extremely jealous of that admiration, which all but mySelf thought her perSon demanded, I was particularly rejoiced at her marriage. Indeed while she was at home, I was Scarce ever noticed by the number of amiable young men, who was intimate at our houSe, and never were there a more choice colleDion ; which was ta be expecled, as they were Selected by a man of So much good SenSe, genius,, and taste, as Colonel Morky.
However, a very short time dapSed,,* before Mr. Dormer, one of his greatest B 5	inti-
[ 10 ]
intimates, applied to him for permission to gain his Fanny’s heart.
Dormer’s assiduities had never pasted unnoticed by me, and I gave him every modest encouragemient to confeSs, what his eyes had long told me; after he had gained the approbation of my father, I did not long remain a stranger to his passion.
His perSon was handSome, and he appeared to a stight acquaintance a faultleSs being;—except that he was thought, by the jedate part of his friends, very reprehenSible for his great levity.— The truth is, he was a very great rake. ——“It is the common received idea, that “ a reformed rake makes the best “ hushandand the Colonel being very partial to me, imagined I should be a very proper perSbn to effedt this
refer-
[ ” ]
reformation ; to confeSs the truth, I had vanity enough to think So too.
My amiable mother was of a very - difierent way of thinking—'she observed a diSpoSition to jealoufy from strong-passions, and the prejudices that naturally take place in the opinion of a rake, ^ whoSe conversation and more intimate connexions have been with the most abandoned of our Sex.—She therefore intreated Colonel Morley to delay the marriage, until she had made Sorrie very^ necessary inquiries into the state of her.
Fanny’s heart.
She must indeed have thought it very eJfentiaJ—or she would not have presumed to shew a reiuXance at what he. had reSolved.-r-Afcer repeated Soliicita--tions on her fide, and great- reluXance; on his, he conSented to postpone the,;
B 6	marriage,
1
[ 12 .1'
marriage until she had held the intended conference with me.
By way of gaining Some time for her poor girl, whom she looked on as one going to be Sacrificed, she was Several days before she began a conversation, which she thought So essential to my future happineSs—but my Father expressed So much diiTatisfadlion at the delay, that she called me into her cloSec the next morning, and interrogated me in the following manner.
“ Colonel Morley, my dear, has, a few days fincc, received a very advantageous propoSal for you from Mr. Dormer—he tells me it is, in point of circumstances, a most unexceptionable offer—and that be has permuted Mr. Dormer to uSe his endeavours to gain your heart.—I knew Sowell the delicacy of my girl’s feelings, that I could not
Suffer
[ 13 I
Suffer her to be precipitated intO' an union with any man, until I was affur-ed by herSelf she prefered him to any other;—or rather to caution you against marrying any man, you do not love well enough, to wish for the application he has made.—AnSwer me with that candour I have ever loved you for, and do not attempt to conceal any thing from your fond mother, which in the end will be deceiving yourSelf.’*
I told this best of women—That I had ever prefered Mr. Dormer to any of the gentlemen that had vifited at our liouSe—“ Why,” Said she, interrupting rne, “ did you prefer him ^ was it for the beauty of his perSon—or, my dear Fanny, that he has been more assiduous in his attentions—or, confeSs the truth my love, ha? not his flattery been more ‘—I will not Say fulSome—but more pro-■fuSe than that of any other man ?”
The
[ H J
The question made me blush—but I assumed courage enough to proceed.— He is extremely handSome, I replied, and appears SenSible and good-tempered.—My father has approved of him— and, if you have no objedtion, I shall be happy to. give him my hand.
■However forward this Speech may appear, it is eaSily accounted for, as I was really very anxious to be married, -—no uncommon cafe with youth and inexperience,—and I own my vanity Suggested it a great flight to my charms to have remained Jingle So long.
Mr. Dormer’s w'as the first offer I had ever had, and as my lister had miet with So many, when much younger than I was—1 had my fears^^—lest I might, if I lost this, never have another oppor-tunity of marrying.
My
[ IS ]
My mother Seemed SenSibly affedfed a:t my readineSs to accept of Dormer, though she endeavoured to conceal it.
“ Well, my love,” Said she, “ Since your wishes accord with your Sather’s, I shall only give you this caution:—Be as little as possible with Mr. Dormer in your father’s or my abSence, and if an early day is fixed on for your marriage, do not obje<fl to it.”
But, my dear madam, have you no objeftion ?	“ May you never repent,
Fanny ?” Said she, and left the room.
I was So affedled by her manner and conversation, that I could not refrain from tears—and when I met my father at dinner, he noticed it to me.
“ What has your mama Said to you, Fanny ?-^I thought the proSpefl of a
hand”
' [ .6 ]
handSome hushand, elegant houSe, genteel equipage, and fine cloaths for a certain occaSion, would have elated the
Spirits oS a young girl like you ?------I
was going to reply, when Dormer ap. peared, dressed to greater advantage than I had ever Seen him :—I learned aSterwards that he came by my lather’s appointment, from ^whom he had received an assurance oS SucceSs.
Coming up to me, and taking me by the hand—My lovely Fanny I why So , grave Said he—“ can the thought of being Mrs. Dormer occaSion this alteration ?—but the Colonel has conSented to your taking an airing with me this aSternoon, and I hope you will return in. better Spirits..'”
‘‘ Aye,’’Said my father, “ I will trust her with you”—then turning to me-— “ You are very abSurd,” Said he, “ and
ought
[ 17 I
ought to know when you are well off; do not try his patience hefare marriage, lest he should put yours to the proof after'V—Then taking my hand and giving it to Dormer,—“ There,” Said he, “ is your little wife eledS—uSe her kindly for your Morley’s Sake.”— Dormer kiffed my hand in raptures, and led me to the chariot.
We had a most agreeable ride, and Dormer became more and more dear to me, as I imagined, every hour I was with him.—He generally came to our houSe in the morning, and remained until bed-time; but even this frequent Society did not Satisfy him, and he entreated that we might be married in a few days.—It was on the Friday he made the application for my father to name an early day.—On the TueSday following I very yrillitigky refigned my liberty.—I then became mistreSs of a
very
,[ .8 ]
very elegant houSe—three carriages— beSides palianquins, and a great number of lervants.
The Splendor which every perSon of any rank live in at Bengal, I am not able to give you, who have been accuS-tomed to the Englisti manners, any idea of—This pageantry is very attrading to a young mind, and it had Such an effed on mine, that it alleviated many* cares that must attead a marriage with a man, that I too Soon discovered 1 did not love.
Though Mr. Dormer was my first lover—it is with shame I rested he was not the last.—From the first month of my marriage, it became a fajhion to admire me, and every new acquaintance added a lover to my train —Vanity certainly was my predominant passion.— Though 1 knew the impropriety—nay
the
[	19 ]
the criminality of listening to the praiSea lavished on me by any man but my hushand, I had not the reSolution to treat them with that contempt which was consistent with my character as a wife.
I take Heaven to witneSs! I never was criminal—yet I confeSs I was very,
very imprudent----1 have chatted most
familiarly in my hujband.s prefence with the very man I knew he jealous of —and Suffered another to take a kiSs before he left the room. TheSe, and a thouSand other coquettish levities, laid a foundation for a jealouSy and diSgust, which all my concessions and change of condutst could never eradicate—but I was too Severely, nay I was inhumanly punished for my condudt.—He was fo extremely jealous, that he confined me to my chamber for above fix weeks, and when any cards of invitation were
Sent
t 20 ]
Sent to me, he anSwered them unknown to me, by assuring the parties I was confined by Some violent diSorder, and even entered into Such minute particulars of my caSe, that it was impossible for them to doubt the truth of his aS-Sertions; he had a phyfician to attend me, and formed various Schemes to deprive me of even the Society of my o\yi^ relations.
At the expiration of the time 1 mentioned, he Seemed to shew Some figns of returning tenderneSs, and propoSed I should accompany him to Major ForteS-cue’s, provided I would promiSe not to discover the falshood of his reports of my illneSs.
Had my inclinations led me to throw So great a stigma on his charafter, his menaces were Sufficient to prevent my betraying him.
We
Si
[ 21 ]
\
We accordingly went to my Sister’s, and had not been tljerc' long, before Captdin Haliifax came in.
He was formerly an admirer of my Sister’s, and though her hushand was not a stranger to the circumstance, he gave him a very pressing invitation to occupy an apartment in his houSe.
Captain Haliifax appeared the w.hole evening very assiduous to pleaSe my SiS-ter—I could not refrain from meditating on the difference in the diipofition of her hushand and mine—the former shewing every Symptom of good humour at attentions being paid to his wife, which if I bad received from any man, would probaMy have endangered my life. This refiedlion uaturally induced me to frequently cast my eyes towards Captain H-------and Nancy.
But
[ 22 ]
But thejaundiced imagination of Mr, Dormer attributed every glance at Captain H----, to proceed Srom a Sudden
preference I felt for him—and I Suffered fresh Severities for daring to look at any perSon but my hushand.
On my return home, the impending storm burst over my head.—He Swore I had Seen the villain (Such was his epithet) more than once---that our eyes
perfedlly understood each other’s language ; but that as he could not obtain the proofs of my incontinence, he could not have Satisfadion.—However, he would at least avoid my making him the laughing-stock of the whole fadtory, by Sending me over to England by the first ships. He again confined me to my old priSon, and Suffered no perSon to See me, but himSelf and the black wo-mem
The
[	23	]
The threat of Sending me over to England, which you may perceive was intended as a punishment, was in reality the greatest kindneSs he could con-Ser on me; but I had art enough to Sup-preSs my joy, lest he should recall his intentions.
My dear mother, I Sear, was not a stranger to the miSery of my Situation, but would never believe her Fanny was the perSon in fault. Mr. Dormer prepared my friends for my departure, by pleading that my ill health rendered my stay in that climate impraflicable. The afflidlions of my mind for many months had indeed injured my constitution So much, that there was great reaSon for my friends to believe that his true motive for parting from me. He pro-poSed to my mother, fending me over to the care of Major ForteScue’s brother, who was a married man, and refided at I	Ox-
[ 24 ]
Oxford, and allowing me three hundred pounds a year.
Just before the time fixed for my leaving India, my much lamented mother was Seized with a Spotted fever. So frequent and So fatal in .that country, which deprived her of her existence in few days after she was taken ill.—As the distemper was contagious I was not Sufferec^ to See her, but she left a paper fealed up, with an injundlion to my father to give it me after her death, doubt-ieSs in hopes that the advice it contained, would have double weight with me, when my mind was Softened by affliction, the afflidtion I Severely felt, but I doubt you will judge I have not fuffi-ciently profited by the advice. A fortnight after her death, my father, who wished to difpel the gloom which his recent and real loSs had occafioned,came •to a determination to accompany me to
Eng-
[ 25;]
England.-----At the time I was to quit
Bengal, Mr. Dormer was ordered up the country, which prevented a very disagreeable interview to us both.
I Sorgot to tell you, that Delia had beenYent over to England the year before my marriage, and placed at a'very capital School, to be instrutffed in every branch of polite and uSeful education. I believe Colonel Morley SuSpeded the real cauSe of my Separation from Mr. Dormer, but had too much delicacy ever to make any enquiries of me.
Before my departure for England, Mr. Dormer wrote a letter to my father, in which he tells him, th^t on ressedion he thinks it would be more adviSeahle to place me with a Mr.^i^veland, an old friend of his^ from whom he had re-, ceived many civilities, and who had obligingly aded as his agent, ever Since
VoL. I. '	C	he
C ]
he had been in India: he concludes his letter in thele woi*ds-.
“ MiSs Cleveland was a very amiable woman, and her father offered her to me for a wife ; and though I declined an alliance With him, he never reSented it, but has behaved to me in a very friendly manner: I now wish I had choSe the prudent.^ rather than the beautiful woman ; but it is in vain to look back: I have been infatuated by your daughter, and shall never ceafe to love her while I have life.”
The indelicacy of expressing thcfe Sentiments to my father, needs no comment. On my arrival in England we landed at Southampton, and you remember came to your houSe that very night; when I Saw your Sister I could , not help wishing she had been honoured with my name. My Sather, who you
know
[ 27 1
know took lodgings in the neighbourhood, promised to See me often, fully fenSible that no Situation can be more ifkSome than to be in a strange country (for I looked on Bengal as my native place), without a friend to whom I could communicate my astli6tions!—A gleam of comfort; arofei in my rriind from your delicate and well-timed assiduities, that in Some degree reconciled me to my Situation, and made me hope I should, as 1 now do, look back on my former troubles as a dream I had just awoke from.
I have nothing left to tell my beloved Lucy more than she already knows, except the motive for my quitting town.
The last time we were together at the Pantheon, in company with Mr. Grenville, your lover: and your friend Mr, BoSwell, the former having left us for C 2	Some
[ 28 1
Some time, made an apology on his return, and Said very gallantly, you may remember that nothing ■ could have kept him So long Srom two oS the loveliest women in the world, but an unexpected interview with his old acquaintance Captain Hallifax, of whoSe arrival in England he had not received any advice.—I was greatly diSconcerted to hear he had left India, as it immediately occurred to me, Mr. Dormer would believe his coming over was a Scheme concerted between us.
As I thought I should have leiSure to write the History of my Life, when I had lost your loved Society, I declined entering into any particulars, when you . pressed So often to know the cauSe of my tears.
I determined when 1 he,ard Captain Hallifax was arrived, not to hazard Mr.
Dor-
I 29 ]
Dormer’s being informed we had ever Seen each other in England ; 1 had often expressed my wishes to See Oxford, and as Mr. ForteScue had wrote me a very pressing invitation to viSit his wife, and as my Sister had married his brO;^h?r, I thought I could with great propriety make an excurfion to See them, and at the Same time avoid an interview with Hallifax. TheSe were my motives for .quitting town So abruptly, and you are likewise acquainted with my reaSon for fixing at Oxford.
All I have now to hope Is, that I shall' remain here unnoticed by the men, (you may laugh if you will, but I am not So vain, nor Such a lover of flattery as you may think) of which you know there muSt be a great majority, and avoid feeing that man who unintentially has deprived me of the greatest felicity 1 C 3	have
I 3° 1
have ever experienced, the Society of my Lucy.
As I think I have now entitled my-felf to a reciprocal confidence, I will dispatch this letter without any account of She family I am with, or what may be worth relating of this Scat of the Mofes.
When my cpriofity, which' ypir have excited, is gratified, I will then be particular in every thing that occurs to me in this place; one information, as it will give you pleaSure, I cannot omit mentioning, the family I am with pay greater attentions, and are more anxious to amuSe me—in a word, I have received more friendly assiduities than I thought it possible to experience out of your father’s family.

LETTER III.
MISS LUCY CLEVELAND
T O
MRS. DORMER.
St. James’s-ftreet, YOU have frequently given proofs of your discernment, by declaring that my “ flights of gaiety were assumed, and that I was in reality unhappy,” and you have shewn more petulance at the Supposition of my having a concealment from you, than I recolledt to have observed on any other occafion. After the unreServed confidence you have placed in me, you would have just reaSon to complain if I continued to have any reserves to you; I will then, my dear Fanny, even at the hazard of your good opinion, open my whole Soul to you.
When
[ S3 1
When I have preffed you to diSclofe to me the little anecdotes oS yourSelf and Samily, you declined it Srom the laudable motive of concealing Some very palpable errors in your hushand’s conduit towards you, and though your condudt is not free from human frailties, or more properly Speaking, from female vanities^ yet his greater knowledge of the world and mankind, render him infinitely the most culpable.
Any concealments. I have had from you have not proceeded from a want of confidence, but from the conSciouSneSs of my crime, which I could wish to conceal even from you;—yet you cannot have a doubt but my heart has experienced more than the dawnings of a tender passion, though I SuppoSe you have So high an opinion of the reditude and morality of my principles, that you think it impossible I should love a man C 5	who
C 34 3
who has already vowed fidelity to another.—I am interrupted.-----A meffage
to Summon me to dinner.
(rN C O N T I N U'A T I O N.)
The first obj.edt that preSented itSelS to me, was the too amiable BoSwell!—^ You know my Sather regards him as one of the family, and my lister and myfelf have ever been instrufled to behave to him as to a brother. Soon after he was introduced to us, “ That young man,”’ Said my father, “'possesses more good qualities than' I ever found centered im one man; his Sentiments are just; his manner peculiarly his own,, lofty and elegant; his language eloquent and harmonious;, he is benevolent and Sincere; and has all the accomplishments of a gentleman., and much knowledge as a fcholar.-^Yet to prove that merit is^ not always rewarded, he has .been un-
for-
[ 35 1
fortunate in his connedion with a wo^ man, whoSe pretty face has infatuated
him into a marriage.----On many ac^
counts that it may not be proper to ac-* quaint you girls with, and which his own prudence Sees the propriety of, I have given Some hints that will prevent his ever introducing her to my daughters,’’.
Thus did my worthy father delineate the many virtues of a man, whom your poor Lucy already began to find too formidable.—My vanity had Suggested to me at the first interview, thaf I had made an equal impression on him—•-but when I heard he was already married ! I was almost petrefied by the inteL ligencc.
On retiring to my room, I took a boost, but that was inSushcient to drive the plea ling image from my mind, his figure—his manner—his Sentiments— C 6	were
[ 36 ]
were all I could attend to, and I even repeated what I had heard him Say, as*' it were, Spontaneoufiy, instead of reading what was before me.—-I Sat down to my, forte-piano, but found it unhar-monious ; I took my pencil, but could paint only the dear figure whoSe idea ingroffed_ my whole-mind; one of the (ketches I here incloSe, but you who have Seen him, will perceive it is nor a good refemblance; the face cannot be eastly delineated, where there is more of Sentiment, than colour or proportion —the effed of the pencil is poor, and must ever fail, in a countenance that is light-ed-up in every feature by a great mind^ and an heart full of SenSibility,
I have negleded nothing to stop th« . progreSs of this fatal passion, but all my efforts have been vain ; it Seems as if it were interwoven with my nature, and
will.
[ 37 I
will, I fear, never Separate from my^ heart, but with my life!
“Of all afHiftions tawght a lover yet,
*Tis fure the hardeft fcience to forget I Unequal talk! a paffion to refign.
For hearts fo touch’d, fo pierc’d, fo loft as mine! Ere fuch a foul regains it’s peaceful ftate.
How often muft it love, how often hate!
How often hope, defpair, refent, regret,
Conceal, difdain—do all things but forget V*
You are not ignorant of the assiduities I have received from the worthy and agreeable Mr. Grenville ; you have often expressed your astonishment at my not permitting him to apply to my farther for his permission to addreSs me.— You have expatiated on his many amiable qualities, and v/ished me to become his wife.—I felt the force of your ar^ guments—I am not blind to his many virtues—but I can never love him—the die is cast—and I am doomed to mi-fery [
Gren-
[ 38 ]
Grenville has just been here.—After again urging his Suit, with all the ten-derneSs and energy that might be ex-pefted from a feeling heart, and a good understanding, without making the impression on me he wished, and perhaps expedled ;—He declared he would tomorrow ash my father’s conlint to our union, and urge him to exert that influence over me, that his parental ten-derneSs gave him a right to. Alarmed at this, I begged, I intreated him tore-main Silent; but when I found he would take no denial, I ventured to tell him, my heart was not mme to give. After 1 had made this confeffion, I was .So abashed, and So overpowered by my feelings, that I could not refrain from tears.
“ Be not unhappy,” Said he, “ my much-loved girl! do not think So unjustly of me to Suppofe, after the generous.
f 39 1

A S there isffo'stri6l: a friendship Sub-fisting between you and my daughter •Lucy,. 1 have taken the liberty to write to you on a Subjedl:, in which a fond parent is most effentia:Ily concerwd.
I am very far advanced in years, and as the education I have given my daughters, will be their only portion, I am extremely anxious to fee them advan-tageoussy Settled.—Any little matters I can Save, I shall reServe for my elder child, as the beauty of Lucy’s perSon and her many accomplishments, enable,

Tell her, though he is jiekher young •nor handfome^ he ^fleffes many amiable qualities—tell her, lexcept the first-fnentioncd recommendations, which can ■have no influence hut on weak minds, he ‘has every thing but rank.—As a partial father, I think my girl deServes even a title.—But tell her, now-a-days young, ■men of fashion Spend their fortunes before they come to them, in gaming and debauchery; consequently, they look out Sor a rich wife, that may .enable them to purchaSe a pretty mistreSs.
[	44 ]
But our Lucy is So blind to her own charms, that she looks not Sor a, Settlement beyond her preSent Situation.
You Semale friends know every movement of each others hearts—give me leave to alk my dear Mrs, Dormer, whether my girSs affedions are SubServient to her father’s will, oris there any prior attachmentIf there is, and the man is worthy of her, though he cannot put her in poffession of that affluence which she will attain by becoming Mrs. Arlington; if there is a genteel Sufficiency, I will conSent to their union. It shall never be Said I Sacrificed the happineSs of my darling child from a mercenary motive—At the fame time remember, 1 will never conSent to her debasement.
You now, my dear madam, are acquainted with my Sentiments----1 am

MRS. DORMER.
St. James’s-Rreet.
My dear Mrs. Dormer,
OUR poor Lucy has been very dangeroufiy ill with a Sever, and at the time your first letter arrived was quite delirious.
We called in Dodtor H— at the first of her diSorder, who gave us very little’hopes of her recovery ; he ordered her to be bled immediately, and then to be blistered :—My father,, who was watching by her bed-fide, ordered me to diSpatcli a Servant to request Mr. Bof-well to come immediately, for, Said he,
turning
I 49 ]
turning to Dodor H-------, I have a great
opinion of that young man’s abilities	^
as a Surgeon, and should prefer him to bleed my poor girl.
Lucy, whom we SuppoSed too weak to move without assistance, immediately raiSed herfelf in bed, and catching hold of my fiither’s hand, “ Ah, Sir 1”
Said she, bursting into a flood of tears,
, “ he is married already /”—and then Sunk down in the bed in a fainting fit.
We were in a state of equal furprife as distradtion, not being able to account for the dear girl’s exclamation.
After Mr. Bofwell entered the room, her fenfes feemed gradually to return ; he was much affedted at the melancholy Scene, and at observing my father struggle to SuppreSs his grief, I faw him first look at Lucy, and then turn aSide his face to weep; I thought to be fure flie
VoL. I.	D	must
[so ]
must be dying, or a mere intimate in the family could never be So much affedfed. After-a moment’s pauSe, he took her hand; I Saw him give it a gentle preS-Sure, which, if I am not mistaken, she returned.
As she was by this time a little recovered, my father propoSed her being bled ; but BoSwell Said the melancholy Scene he had been a witneSs to, had af-fedfed him So much, that he was incapable of performing the operation.— Dodlor H. then Said, that as the blisters bid fairest to produce an alteration for tll^hetter, he was in hopes there would not be a necessity for any perfon to bleed her, but as quietnefs would be the greatest restorative, he adviSed every perfon but me to leave her.
BoSwell immediatelyquitted the room, and the rest followed the example;
when
[ Si ]
when they were gone, she called me to her bed-Side.
My brain, Said she, is Something eaSier, and my SenSes are clear, which I believe they have not been for Sometime. Indulge me now with the fight of my dear Fanny’s letters; I have Some faint idea there was one came at the first of my illneSs, and as she has not received any anSwer to it, her friendly anxiety, I' amcertain,hasinduced her to writeagain; I hope you have opened them, and relieved her from a state of SuSpence 1 told her I had opened the last letter, and had began to reply to it; that the first had been given to my father, but that she need not alarm herSeif, for I was very certain he would deliver it to her un-opened, when he thought her well enough to read it.
D 2	Fetch
[	52	]
Fetch it immediately. Said she, and tell him a letter from my Fanny will half effed my cure.
I then procured her your letter, wherein you incloSed that from my lather, which he had not opened.
This uncommon generoSity and delicacy from a parent, Said she, shall not go unrewarded ! 1 will reveal my miserable story to him, and not add dissimulation to the rest of my crimes.
She then gave me the letters to read, and made an apology for having kept me So long ignorant of the state of her heart; but, laid she, you shall never again have reaSon to complain of me. During my delirium, 1 perceive I ex-pofed mySelf; but my reSolution is now fixed, and I will conquer my weakneSs, or die in the attempt.
She
[ 53 ]
She intends writing to my father, for she Says after what her delirium has discovered to him, she cannot Support an interview, until she has merited his for-giveneSs.
I have made her promiSe not to write to you until the next post, upon giving my word she shall then be at liberty to uSe her pen, in fpite of all the dodtor’s prohibitions.
As I propofe refigning this tash to your amiable but unfortunate Lucy, 1 shall not add any more, than that you have a very Sincere friend,
and well-wisher, in

HENRY BOSWELL, ESQ^
TO
JOHN DEL MONT, ESQ^ Loadon;
Y O U are not ignorant of the connexion that has SubSisted between me and Nancy Collins ; it is now four years finceour first intimacy; you may remember I told you, that on her assuring me she was pregnant (which by the bye was falSe), I promised her she should appear as my wife, and I introduced her to many of my acquaintance as Mrs. BoS-well. The report was Soon buzed abroad that I had married my mistreSs, and it prevented my introducing her to Some of my friends.
Mr.
[ 55 ]
Mr. Cleveland was one who could Scarce believe I had married her, for he knew her family, and entertained too good an opinion of me, to think I would enter into an alliance with them.
He requested me, on account of his daughters, not to introduce her in his family; he Said he had told them I was married, but not happily, and particular reaSons rendered it improper for me to introduce Mrs. BoSwell into their company.
This (Said he laughing) will prevent the girls Setting their caps at Such a handSome young fellow ! (obServe I repeat his words) in short, I value your heart, and love your company, BoSwell, but I must have none of your wives, that have been mijtrejj'es, introduced to. my daughters.	'
D 4	rea-
I S6 ]
I readily complied with this request of his, for indeed Nancy had nothing to recommend her but a handSome face, and as the novelty of that was pretty well over with me, I was glad to keep old Cleveland, whoSe opinion I valued, ignorant of her deficiencies.
I believe I have told you, that Mrs. Cleveland has been dead Several years, and that her eldest daughter, who keeps her father’s houSe, has been a mother to the charming Lucy ! in every reSpedl but that of bringing her into the world.
MiSs Cleveland is near thirty, she has a good figure, and an agreeable countenance, and may be noticed, perhaps, by Some man who has never beheld her Sister.
Lucy is not quite eighteen, she is not tall enough for what the world calls a
fine
[ 57 1
fine woman, but her shape is So finely Sormed, that you may justly stile her perSon elegant. Her features, though not perfeftly regular, are all expressive of the Soul within, but her eyes and mouth are diStinguishedly beautiful.
The first time I Saw her, I thought I . should have gazed foreveron her charms, her attraftive perSon reminded me of Alonza’s exclamation !
Who turn’d this flender waill with fo much art,. And ftiut perfeflion in fo fmall a ring ?
Who fpread that pure expanfe of white above,
On which the dazzled fight can find no reft j But, drunk with beauty, Vv^anders up and down Forever, and forever finds new charms ?
But O thofe eyes ! thofe murderers! O whence. Whence didft thou fteal their burning orbs ?
From Heaven ? thou didft, and’tis religion to adors them,”
D 5	The
[ 53 ]
The disparity in their ages, and want of Simularity in diSpoSiton, is the occasion of that reScrve I have obServed to SubSist between the two Sisters, and Seems to prevent Lucy treating MiSs Cleveland, with confidence or familiarity.—But there is a Mrs. Dormer arrived from Bengal, vsho immediately fixed her eye on my Lucy (I mean that is to be) for the confidant of all her ftcrets., and I SuppoSe Lucy reveals her'^s in return ; nay she must, for I never go but she is writing to her, and I never miSs a day, that I can possibly form an excuSe for going.
You know I have often told you, that I would Settle half my fortune on you (were I poffeffed of any), to get fight of Lucy’s letters to her friend.—She has refuSed Grenville, who has paid his addresses to her for near two years, and 1 cannot learn that there is any man she
shews
E 59 1
shews a partiality Sor. In short, I am « in a very cruel state of SuSpenSe, but I will, by Some means, endeavour to find out the motive she assigned Sor rejedling Grenville.

FROM THE SAME TO THE SAME.
^	Dean-ftreet.
I WENT last night to my club at the ShakeSpeare, and on enquiry found Grenville had dined there with a few friends, and that they were expedl-ed back to Sup with us;—but very fortunately none of the members attended beSides my Self, and his friends had declined returning with him.:—“ We have been to half a play together,” Said he, “ but they have all taken their flight different ways.””
I told him I was heartily glad of it, as I wanted half an hour’s tete-a-tete with him.
“ Gome

“ Come—-Pil bet you a rump and dozen,” Said he, “ I gueSs the questions-you are going to ash !—I have told you 1 doated on the charming Lucy ! and I will not keep you in SuSpence reSpedl-ing my SucceSs with her—though as you cannot be a party much concerned, we may as well eat our Supper first, Sor, by Heaven! my vivacity forSakes me, and the recolledlion of my last interview with her, quite unmans me.”
Then you have not been SucceSsful 1 I cried (with the impatience natural to one in my Situation).
“ There is Something So wild in your aSpedl,” Said he, “ that out of pure compassion to your SenSes, I must relieve you; I have not.—She declared she esteemed me as a friend, wished I was her brother (more than I do Harry); but that she could not accept my generous
r 6a ]
rous offer, knowing herSelf to be unworthy to be my wife.—You may be-~ lieve I was not to be put ofi' thus—I declared I would apply to her father the next day, and promiSed to abide by his determination ; I really meant what I Said. When she perceived me So determined, she burst into tears, and de-. dared her heart was not her'*s to give’—• When she had made this declaration, she was So overcome, -that had I not Supported her in my arms, she would certainly have fallen.—I told her I had long SuSpeded what she had confessed, that I would leave her at preSent, and for the future promifed to endeavour to fuppreSs all fonder feelings, and prove my Self her friend.
“ I go there very Seldom, and I will avoid Seeing her as much as possible; though my diSpoSition is Such, that a disappointment of this kind will not
kill
I 63 1
kill me, yet I will not Subjedb mySelf to the mortification of gazing on a jewel I cannot get the possession of,”
Now, Delmont, though in my heart I pitied Grenville, I cannot help congratulating my Self on my good fortune.
I SuSpedled by many hints which he tlirew out, he looked on me as the obstacle to his wishes. After I revealed to him the true state of my connexion with Nancy Collins, and he had got the better of the Surprize my information had occasioned, he Said, he had long SuSpedled Lucy’s attachment was to mCy that he firmly believed her depressure of Spirits proceeded from the great confiift in her mind, in believing I was a mar--ried man.
Now
[	64	]
Now, my friend, if you conSider how I am Situated, you ought to be very grateSul to me, for giving you So much of my time, but do not expedt to hear from me again, till I have packed Nancy off to her relations, and relieved my Lucy’s mind from its preSent anxiety.—*

St. Jaraes’s-Street.
HEAVEN has restored me to the fond wishes and ardent prayers of an indulgent parent, and permitted me once more to write to you my invalua-able friend !
I have had an interview with my father, which I thought when my lister wrote to you, would have been too much for my Spirits, in their preSent agitated state, to have Supported.
On restedlion, I thought it would be abSurd to write to a perSon who was in
the
[ 66 ]
the Same houSe, I therefore attempted to unboSom my whole heart, and endeavoured to deScribe to him the distressed state of my mind.—I Succeeded beyond my expedtations.
On the first day that I quitted my chamber, I told him if he would be at leisure that evening, I would give him my determination on the Subjedt of his letter to you.
‘‘i I am very glad she has Sent it to you,” Said he, “ and I hope it has proved as I intended; an agreeable way of acquainting you with my Sentiments: but I could wish to hear your determination nowy as I shall See Mr. Arlington this evening, and I cannot avoid coming to an eclairciffement: it is now Several months fince he Sollicited an alliance with you, and your indiSpoSition, only could have excuSed this delay.
I then
f 67 ]
I then told him how very Senfible I was of his tenderneSs and condeScention, in conSultirig my inclinations where his, and (he undoubtedly thought) my interest was So materially concerned ; that there was not a thought of my heart,
, that I would not immediately make him acquainted with.—“ It is no more than 1 have hitherto, and will in future de-ferve,” Said he: “ but proceed.”—
I then told him Mr. Grenville had long exerted his endeavours to gain my heart; that, wearied with my continued indifference, he had at length determined to apply to him, to uSe his influence with me, in his favour; in hopes that if his Sollicitations were Supported by parental authority, it would induce me to accept of him; but when I candidly owned my affeftions were engaged, he promised to relinquish all pretenfions as a lover, and declared
after
[ 68 3
after Such a confession on my part, he would not accept my hand, were even my father to Sollicit it.—Mr. Grenville, Sir, is too amiable a man to be deceived, 'and indeed he Seemed thankful for the ingenuous manner in which I had treated him.
My father interrupted me, by faying Mr. Grenville was worthy of my heart, but an alliance with Mr. Arlington was what he wished, and should expedt, unleSs the objedt of my affedlions was in Such a fituation, with reSpedt both to rank and circumstances, as a parent, anxious for the welfare of his child, would be justified in accepting. “ In that cafe, my much-loved girl!” Said he, “ I will crush my ambitious hopes, relinquish Arlington, and conSent to your union with him your heart has made choice of,”
This
‘	[	69	]
This was the moment, Fanny, when my resolution was almost staggered. My father Saw the conflid of my mind. —“ Are you ashamed to name the objedt of your regard ? why do you delay your own happineSs, by keeping me ignorant of the power of compleating it ? Is he a villain or a beggar ?—Yet it is impof-Sible, if he was either, you should love him.”
Ah, dear Sir! faid I, he is neither—" But—but—he is married already.— “ Married !” he exclaimed, “ Then he is a Seducer! a villain !—What! he has Sworn he was Single when he gained your heart, and now avows his marriage, that, he may have you on eafier terms !”— Then Softening his voice,—“ And can my Lucy, my almost revered Lucy !— you who have been fet as a pattern for all your young acquaintance, love and encourage Such a villain ?
I was
I 7° ]
I was So affedled by Such tender epithets, when I knew they were unmerited, that I had Scarce reSolution to undeceive him, but aSter a short pauSe, ^Mr. BoSwell (he started at the name), you will allow is no beggar, and I am Sure he is no villain; perhaps he has been unfortunate, but not criminal.— From the moment you introduced him into our Samily, my heart conceived a regard for him, that not all my prayers to heaven, nor the Systems of morality you have engraven on my mind, could ever eradicate ! As to his Sentiments, I most Solemnly declare, I am to this day a stranger to them ; had you not told me he was married, I should never have known it from him: it is a Subject he has studioussy avoided to enter upon.—At the Same time, I firmly believe our attachment is reciprocal, but
it is only my conjecture.---	^
You
[ 71 ]
You are now informed of the miserable Situation of my heart; but I will, as I have declared to my Sister, conquer my. weakneSs, or die in the attempt!— While I remain Single, I shall not look on my passion So very criminal, as I shall when I have vowed fidelity to another. I cannot think of marrying Mr. Grenville, after the confession I have made to him ; beSides, he is worthy of an undivided heart.—But as Mr. Arlington is ignorant of my attachment, and by report does not poffeSs a great share of delicacy—if it is, or rather as it is, your pleaSure, I am ready to become his wife whenever you think fit.—If it must be. Said I, do not delay it, my heart may oppoSe my resolutions—and if I deliberate long, 1 may,, by my want of refo-lution to perSist in Such a Sacrifice of inclination to duty, become more unworthy your regard.
My
I
[ 72 1
My father expressed great Satisfadlion at my pointing out the means of obliterating my unhappy passion. Said, he should that evening See Mr. Arlington, and give him an invitation to his houSe; that he had no reaSon to fear a delay on his part, for he was affured, the writings only waited to be filled up; “ To Say truth,” continued my father, “ I have Seen the propositions, and my Lucy will poffeSs every elegance of life.”
This trying fcene—this cruel conssidl between a Scene of propriety and inclination, this violence I had done to my heart and feelings, had Such an effed on my weak nerves, and Scarce recovered state of Spirits, that I found my-Self grow So faint, that I thought it time to put an end to the conversation, and begged my father’s permission to retire.
Thus
t 73 ]
Thus, my Fanny, stand matters at preSent.—I SuppoSe I shall, if Mr. Arlington should approve, make the voluntary Sacrifice very shortly. I was going to add—pity me ; but I retradt, I need no greater conSolation, than the Sa- > tisSadlion my heart feels at having aded right.late illneSs has So much depressed my Spirits, that 1 will finish my letter, lest I should infedt you with my melancholy.

HO W very few in your Situation, Lucy, would have aded as you have !
for admitting your conduct is no more than was to be expedled from a girl of yeur principles to Juch a father !—yet there is a merit, as the world goes, in even doing what is right.

E 3	with
:	[ 78 ]
with. Re-peruSe the History oS my Life.
—1 married precipitately a man I too Soon discovered I did not love; could I now Say I am a stranger to that passion, my letters would be still dated from Oxford.
I mentioned before I left London, an intention of coming here before I returned, but I had then no idea of staying So short a time at Mr. Fo'rteScue’s.
Ah, Lucy! 1 have had too many opportunities of discovering the many amiable qualities that Mr. Sedgwick poffeffes.—I Saw him the Second day after my arrival at Oxford, I found he was extremely intimate in the family, and that Mr. ForteScue had allotted an apartment in his houSe for him, whenever he choSe to accept it; his inclination prompted him to occupy it, the ' first night we Saw each other, and he
did
[ 79 ]
did not abSent himSelf one evening during my stay. His perSon is very agree* able, though I do not think he has any just claim to be called handSome, yet the tout enfemhle., is inexpressibly pleaS-ing—lie is not only SenSible, but has a great deal oS ready-wit, and a vein oS humour runs through his conversation, which intitles him, as I am informed, to the appellation oY a choice-Spirit, among the many who covet his company^—he has been brought up to the church, and is now fellow of St. John’s College; I am told his father left him a Small fortune, which he has nearly Spent, shut that he has Sufficient interest to gain good preferment. Among the traits I have observed in his charader, I cannot, without deviating from truth, fay prudence is his prevailing diSpoSition. One recent instance I shall give you, when I tell you, he Seemed to have no more hesitation to declare he was diS-E 4	tradedly
[ 8o ]
tra<stedly fond of me, than if I had been fingle.—I confeSs I found him very attrafting, and perhaps I may have been unguarded enough, to let him perceive I listened with too much pkaSure to his conversation. I do not pretend to be a stoick, and I confeSs I find my mind Soothed by his attentions and ashduities; I believe, nay 1 am Sure it was ill judged to give him room to SuppoSe me partial to him; but I think he has too much generoSity to make an improper advantage of Such a discovery. I kept him ignorant of iny Sentiments for many weeks after he confeffed his regard for me; but a letter, which I received last week from my lister at Bengal, informs me that Mr. Dormer is in So bad a state of health, that the phyficians think the next ships must bring an account of his death; this gave me a gleam of hope —indeed, in a letter which he has written, he tells me that I shall very Soon
be

“ Ah 1” Said he, “ before you leave me. Seal my pardon ! and tell me, if Dormer should die, whether 1 may not hope to find you kind ? may I not then hope to view my wife in my lovely Fanny
There was a time, faid I, when you had reafon to hope for every thing a virtuous woman could grant; 1 fear there has been too little indifference in my condudl towards you—But, however imprudent I may have been, in not stopping the progrefs of an illicit attachment, my future condudt will, I hope, make Some reparation for my former imprudencies.

When Mrs. ForteScue came up to us, he took his leave with all the Semblance of reSpedt, as if no altercation had passed between us.
I told her I had received a very preSs-ing invitation from Mrs. Newman, to Spend a short time with her at Henley, as she expedted to lie in every day.—So far was true, though I should not have

accepted it, if Sedgwick had not taken off the masse and So groSsly inSulted me; but I thought this an excellent opportunity to shew him I could exist without his company, and that I intended to avoid him—he went the next morning to Blenheim with a party from London, and I took the opportunity of his absence, to quit my friends at Oxford, who kindly expressed much concern at parting with me.
1 am now with the lively, agreeable, Mrs. Newman, who married in India about the time I did, and came over to England really on account of her health.
This indiSpofition, which alarmed her fond hushand, proved to be the effeifi: of her pregnancy, which the praditi-oners there never, SuSpeded.
She is a little woman, not very pretty, but more agreeable than many women

men that are handSome; she has very Sprightly eyes; but her Jhape is what is most-admired, it does irideed appear tO’ be “ moulded by the finger of perfection.” Do not be diSpleaSed with my quotation, for though they were BoS-well’s words in deScribing my Lucy’s form, it was I adapted them to Mrs. Newman. She Says she shall never be the chearful creature she has been, until Mr. Newman comes to England, though I think mySelf, it is impoffible to have a greater flow of Spirits.
Now, Lucy, you are informed of my errors, my reformation, and my prefent fituation. I have been very minute in my recitals, as I know you cannot be indifferent to any thing that concerns.

I confeSs I did urge her to realize her hushand’s ideal SuSpicions, by way of alleviating the distreSs she Seemed to feel at being falSely accuSed ; this was the pretended cauSe of my offence j but what other behaviour can any woman exped who complains of her hushand’s ill -treatment, to a man who has avowed him Self her lover ^—^I have too great a Spirit of QiiixotiSm in my diSpoSition, to Suffer females wrongs to go unre-dreffed, and I meant to reward her by my kindnesses for all her hujband.s cru-‘elcies.

MISS LUCY CLEVELAND
TO
MRS. DORMER;
St. James*s-ilreet,
My deareft Fanny,
YOU have been on the edge of a precipice, and nothing but your well-timed retreatcould have Saved you from falling. ReSpedting your unfortunate attachment to Mr. Sedgwick, however ill it may become the unguarded Lucy to arraign your condudl, it is my duty to lead you from that path, which So fatally drew me astray. I am shock’d when I refledt, that you, who are both chaste and delicate !—you who are already married I could Suffer Mr. Sedgwick, or indeed any man, to believe you had a more than
common
[	94 1
common regard Sor him; I am a recent and a fatal proof, that our affeftions are not in our power ; but I have my doubts, whether your heart has ever been under the influence of a more tender attachment than friendship ; you have ever been too SuSceptible of the pleaSure ariSing from your love of adu-lation-i and that pleafing SenSation you have mistaken for a tenderneSs, that it would be a profination to call true love. Sedgwick has, I fuppoSe, confessed the power of your charms,—even this, as you are circumstanced, ought to have been conSidered as an inSult—but did he ever compliment you on your heart and understanding ? and why not ? be-cauSe he Saw that vanity was the prevailing passion of your heart, and that it received gratification, by the approbation his eyes discovered for yow'e fer-fonal attractions. Tell me ingenuoussy, did your heart ever feel an emotion at the
Sight
I 95 ]
Sight of that man, who had not extolled your beauty ? or did one among the number of your ASiatick admirers, which you have mentioned as your misfortune to attradf, ever attempt to affign any motive for loving you, but the ro-mantick one, of the influence of your dL vine eyes, which badrivetted them in your chains, and rendered them your flaves for ever ?
Indeed, Fanny, you would be a very charming woman, and your mind would be lovely as your perSon, were it not for that vein of coquetry, that fond-neSs for admiration, which I am Sorry to Say, is but too deeply implanted in your diSpofition : though I blame you, I at the Same time mingle pity with that blame; you are very faulty, but the original error, was in carrying you at Such an early age into a country, where there was no mediocrity in manners—
nothing
[ 96 J
nothing rational—nothing domestlck—* as I learn, ever employs hvomen in that enervating climate; you are there either on the bed of fickneSs, or in Scenes of dissipation ; the Scarcity of women too, gives an additional keenneSs to the passions of the men. ^The natives arc So great a foil to the English ladies (in the opinion of the Europeans), that any of the latter, that are not absolutely disgusting, are idolized as divinities.-^ But to return to the fubjedt of your letter.
In not loving the man you have married, you are greatly to be commiserated, and your loving another, is a considerable aggravation of your misfortune ; but to encourage Sedgwick’s aS-liduities, to give him reaSon to think you have a regard for him (which, for reaSons I have already hinted, I hope I am right in believing you never felt),
is
I 97 ]
is beyond being imprudent—it is criminal. You have quitted OxSord, So Sar was right; but do you think he will be ‘So eaSily denied ? that he will not follow you ? I will hope that you will be very circumSpedt in your condudl; ressedt on the SatisSaflion you derive Srom the con-SciouSneSs oS your own innocence, when you hear of Mr. Dormer’s SuSpicions that are So injurious to your charadter.-In romances you may read of girh dying martyrs to an ill placed or hopeleSi passion: could one believe it ever to happen, it must be its effedl on a weak mind, borne away by the first impulSe of the passion: too irreSolute to call reaSon to their aid, they fink, and often faH, without the Small merit of a faint reSistance.—If you should have an interview with Mr. Sedgwick, remember what is due to yourfelf—behave with dignity., not rudenefs, the lat-ter will appear the effcdt of petulance., VoL. I.	F	the
[ 98 ]
the former that of a virtuous mind. Danger conSists chiefly in opinion ; be not afraid of yourSelf, and you will have nothing to apprehend.
I do not doubt but you are anxious to know if I have had the intended viSit from Mr. Arlington. He has been with us every evening Since I last wrote to you.—He is turned of forty, but by a regular courfe of life, he has preserved a good constitution, and a very florid completion. The only proof he gives of an advancement in years, is by his prudence and experience. His manner is more Sincere than courteous, and he is destitut^of that tenderneSs which we look for in a lover. My father very kindly represented him to me as a very different man to what I have found himj for, as far as my judgment can penetrate, Mr. Arlington is not only a very worthy charater, but in many reSpeds
, a very
C 99	]
a very agreeable man; and, if I know my own heart, I will exert every power to pleaSe him, and render mySeif the agreeable companion.
He has purchased a houSe in Harley-street, which will be ready for his, I mean our reception, the latter end of next week. Most likely I shall, before the expiration of that time, jb^come his wife.—My God ! what am I doing .?— the blotted paper will inform you.— ^ Ah, Fanny ! you who know the fitua-tion of my heart, tell me if it is not cxcuSable ; ratherthan condemn my weakneSs !
“ See, while I write, my words are loft in tears! The lefs my fenfe, the more ray love appears :
No lime the dear remembrance can remove,
For, oh ! how vaft a memory has love ?”
Fanny !—I shall not invite you to be preSent' when I give my hand to a man F 2	I can

This gleam oS hope enables me to touch upon leSs essential circumstances, I am So well recovered from the bruiSes I received in my Sail, that I am able to quit my bed, but the Surgeon (and I must agree with him) Says it is absolutely necessary Sor me to keep my chamber a week longer; nothing but this should prevent my breathing the Same air with the beloved of my heart,.
It is now only a month fince I placed Nancy in a family about ten miles from this place; and a Servant of theirs arrived about an hour ago, with a meS-Sage from his master, to know if MiSs Collins had been, or was with me (I placed her there as a distant relation, who was dependant on me), for that a gentleman,' in a post-chaiSe and .four,
had
f MO J

I told the man I was obliged to his master and mistreSs for the trouble they had taken; that she had not been with me, and as she had adled So very imprudently, I should take no farther trouble about her. 1 preSented the fellow with a guinea to drink my health,, which gave him as much Satisfaction as his intelligence had given me. If she had resolution, or rather inclina-
iioriy

tion^ to go off with another man, she could not be very firmly attached to me. I began to think, from many corroborating circumstances, it is not the jirfi time she has been falSe to me; and I look upon her living with another man, as a very fortunate event; for it will be a proof to Lucy, I have no preSent connexion with her.
My friend Delmont does every thing in his power to render my involuntary^ stay agreeable : the houSe is fitted up in a very elegant and tasty style, and the Spot it stands on is romantically pleaS-ing ; the houSe stands in the middle of a garden, what an inchanting Situation ! one can Scarce be melancholy within the atmoSphereof flowers : Such lively hues, and delicious odours, not only addreSs themSelves agreeably to the SenSes; “ but touch with a Surprising delicacy the Sweetest movements of the mind.”—

If it was in the nature of things to be happy in the abSence of them we love,, Delmont’s friendly attentions would in-Sure my felicity : 1 had received repeated follicitations from him to vifit this delightful Spot, but I certainly should' not at this time,, when I ought, and certainly should have been devoting all my time to my Lucy, had not my accident in coming from.Dunmow, where I had left the faithful Nancy, obliged, me to stop at a farm-houfe in this neighbourhood, until I could receive assistance.—I drove her down from Londom in a phaeton, but an accident happening to it, I would not wait for it’s being repaired, and hired a horfe to bring me

HISTORY
O F
MRS. M O R L E Y.
MR. ROWLEY, who was a very wealthy tradeSman, Saw me one Sunday in Kenfington-gardens, and was attradf-ed (as he afterwards told me) by my perSon: he introduced himSelS to me, by expressing his SurpriSe, at my being without a gentleman as an eScort, and requested I would not deem him impertinent^ if he begged permission to attend
[ 120 ]
tend me, and a young lady who was with me, to the place of our abode. It was rather late, and as my father allowed me very little pocket-money, coach-hire was an objed; we therefore thought it most prudent to accept Mr. Kowley’s offer.
My father, on our return home, was much pleaSed with the attentions paid me by Mr. Rowley, and gave him a general invitation to our houSe ; he apparently accepted it with great pleaSure, and stayed only until the next evening before he renewed his vifit.
My mother died when I was an infant, and my father left the management of every domestick concern, to a woman who had formerly been his Servant; I had been at a boarding-School for a few years, and on my return this woman was fixed on for my companion;
she
[ I2I ]
she was conceited, ill-tempered, and ignorant; after Such a charader, you will readily SuppoSe I Spent a number of irkSome hours. My father being Seldom at home, rendered my Situation the more diSagreeable ; and the lonely hours (which I preferred to the Society of a fervant) would have preyed on my Spirits, and prob;ibly in time injured my health, if I had not cherished the expedation of being delivered from a Situation So repugnant to my feelings.
The governeSs, with whom I was placed, took particular pains to instill into me, every principle of religion and morality ; and taught me to look up to the Author of our being, for every Species of happinefs here and hereafter.
I was not of an age or diSpofition, at that time, to extend my ideas further
VoL. I.	G	than
[ 122 ]
than this world ; and I was better pleaS* ed with the doftrine contained in thoSe books which the Servants lent me, that love was the hujinefs oS our lives, and that every handfome girl stood a chance to be run away with at Some time or other, if her inclinations led her, as (on consulting my glaSs) I thought my perSon by no means contemptible, I had great expedlations of Some man taking me from a state of dependance, and raising me to the possession of an affluent fortune. I was young and inexperienced enough, to be confirmed in this idea by an incident that happened Some time after I left School; a GypSy viewing and reviewing my hand at many and different times, and still persisting in the fame story, which was, that I should marry a man of very large fortune; was the additional motive for my looking forward to a deliverance (as I have
before
[ 123 ]
before mentioned) from my irkSomc Situation.
Mr. Rowley was very frequent in his vifits; his appearance being genteel, and my father well pleaSed at the preference he shewed me, I was weak enough to believe in the predidion of an ignorant vagrant, and to SuppoSe it was Mr. Rowley she had in her view,
. when she foretold what no human being could have a knowledge of.
In a very few weeks Mr. Rowley obtained my permission to alk my father’s conSent to our marriage. As he could not give me a shilling to my fortune, he gladly accepted the propoSal, and I very willingly exchanged the name of Leifter for that of Rowley^ two months after my first interview with your father.
G 2	Within
I 124 ]
Within the first twelve months your Sister Nancy was born, and two years aSter you made an addition to our fa« mily. Your Sathcr Soon after retired from bufineSs, to a Small villa at Richmond.
From that period I experienced nothing but distresses. Mr. Rowley was a fatal instance of the abSurdity of people brought up in bufineSs, and accuS-tomed to an adive life, retiring, as they falSely imagine, to enjoy themSelves: they do not rested, that it requires more philoSophy, and a more studious turn, than is generally the caSe with men in that line of life, to find employ for the vacant hours. At first the novelty of the Scene, and the Superintend-1 ing little alterations in our manfion and garden, provided him with employ, and he was not only chearful, but highly pleaSed with his Situation; but by
degrees
[ 125 ]
degrees he became listleSs for want of avocation, and dull for want of the company and bufy Scenes of town and trade.
This first induced him to become a member of a card club, merely to pafs away the winter evenings—but to be brief, by degrees he fell into that most pernicious attachments—a love of play. Although he had acquired a genteel, but not an elegant Sufficiency, he lost fuch confiderable shshs, that he found it impossible ever to retrieve his affairs ; and it was difficult, even with the greatest frugality, to preServe appearances.
This Sudden tranfition in his circumstances, So much affedted his Spirits, that it brought on a decay, and he Survived the loSs of his fortune, little more than a twelvemonth.
G 3	I was
[ 126 ]
I was a young widow, and was left with two children, in a very embarrassed Situation.
The apothecary that attended your father in his illneSs, and who was a man of Some property, compassionated my fituation; he adviSed me to diSpoSc of my houshold furniture, and made me the offer of his houSe, until I had con-‘ Suited with my Sriends, what plan 1 should adopt for the maintenance of mySelf and my two little girls. Mr. 'Smyth, the gentfetnan who made me this generous propoSal, was a married man, and his wife bore an unexceptionable charadler: I thought myfelf particularly fortunate, in having the 'Society of two Such worthy people, not only to diSpel the gloom, which my recent loSs had occaSioned, but likewiSe to adviSe me reSpedling my future plan of life; for whatever their opinion
should
[ 12/ ]
should be, I was determined to abide by it; as I could not with propriety apply to my relations (my Sather had been dead Some time}, owing to Mr. Rowley’s Singularity of temper, and Sor other reaSons not worthy to be recited, he had never Suffered me to keep up an intimacy with them.
Mr. Smyth thinking me very capable, recommended me to Lady S-----,
to be governeSs to her daughter; he kindly promiSed to place you and your lister, at a genteel School, and to adopt you as his children.
A few days after, as 1 was expressing my gratitude for Such disinterested. Such unmerited friendship, the Servant interrupted me by announcing,Captain Morley is arrived. Sir, and requests half an hour’s conversation with you.”—Mr. Smyth left the room,fbut in a very short G 4	time
[ >28 ]
time returned, introducingCaptainMor-ley to me.—“ There, Frank,’* Said he, “ is a young amiable widow ! what Say you to her ?” ‘ I Say,* replied Morley, ‘nothing—nothing!’ reiterated Mr. Smyth, with greatquickneSs, “ I thought, Sir, you would have Said much—and that to the purpoSe too, or 1 would never have introduced you to So much excellence!”
‘ Dear Sir,* Said Morley, ‘ you are So hasty, that you interrupt me most unfortunately, I was going to Say, Nothing, that could be Spoke with propriety in the Lady’s preSence—my Sentiments reSpedfing her, shall not long remain a Secret, but when I have not been half an hour in the room with her, to fay more would be indelicate to the highest degree.—
Mr.
[	129	]
Mr. Smyth Seemed to feel the just-neSs of the reproach, and put an end to a conversation (So very embarrashng to me, though apparently a jocular one), by proposing a walk to the hill.
Mrs. Smyth was indiSpoSed, but would not permit me to remain at home to keep her company. On my urging the impropriety of my going without a female.—“ Be not too prudish,” Said she, “ an over rigid caution, Sometimes gives room for SuSpicions, where there is no foundation for them ; it is absolutely indelicate toSuppoSe there is danger; and it would be prudish to apprehend an im-propriety,when you knowyourcompany: you must either SuppoSe yourSelf irreSist-ably attrafling, or your companions very abandoned.; you cannot be aSraid of my hushand—and Morley is his friend !**
G 5	I was
[	13° ]
I was struck with the justneSs and propriety of Mrs. Smyth’s observations and Sentiments; and I intreated herfor-giveneSs for giving her occaSion for fuch a ledture : then immediately equipped mySelf for my walk.
While she was giving me this advice, Mr. Smyth had been clofetted with Morley; and I am pretty confident what 1 am going to relate, was a concerted thing between them.—We had but just passed the Castle Inn, when the Servant overtook Mr. Smyth, and delivered a letter : after he had read it, he expressed himfelf concerned to leave us, but Said he was under a necessity of vifiting a patient who lived on the Green, but dessred we would wait for him on the Queen’s Terras, as he should Soon return*
He
t 131 J
He was no Sooner gone, than I Saw it was a Scheme to leave Morley and mySelf together, and to own a truth, was far from feeling diSpleaSed ; I was prompted by my own inclinations to converse with him, free from the interruption of a third perSon : I will be as brief as possible in this part of my narrative, as nothing can be more Surfeiting than the conversation of lovers, to> any but the parties.
Morley made a very agreeable uSe off the time we were left together; after Gonfeshng his regard for me, he told me his profpedls promiSed great promotion in the India Company’s Service;, and that if I could love him well enough to quit my native country, and accompany him to Bengal, that we might live in a very gmteel stile ; tha|i. he should likewise wish me to conSent toi my two girls going with us, as there' G 6-	would.
[	132	]
would then be a certainty of their establishing their fortunes by marriage.
From the first hour I converfed with the agreeable Morley, 1 experienced fenSations to which I had until then been a stranger; in a word, he was my first and only love ; for when I married Mr. Kowley, it was to comply with my fa-ther’s follicitations, and likewiSe to rid mySelf of a difagreeablehome. It is true, we were what the world called a happy couple, for as I had then never Seen a man I could have liked better, I was perfedlly Satisfied with my Situation, and thought I was more fortunate than most girls who were destitute of money. But I was more melancholy than afflided at the loSs of my hushand ; and the avowal of Morley’s passion, Seemed to open a new world to me.
My
[ 133 .1
My good Sriend, Mr. Smyth, was So anxious Sor our immediate marriage, that he extradled a promiSe Srom me, that as Soon, as propriety would admit, I would make his young Sriend happy. From the time the match was concluded, you may SuppoSe I gave up all thoughts of going as a governeSs.
Mr. Smyth allotted an apartment in his houSe for Morley, and as I had So much of bis Society, I was in no haste for our marriage; except to free me from being longer an incumbrance to Mr. Smyth: indeed, I was anxious to be Settled in the Indias, as.. I thought it probable I might then have an opportunity, or more properly Speaking, the ability, to make Some return to my worthy friends, for- their incomparable friendship.
The
[ 134 I
The time at length arrived when I gave him my hand, who had long been in possession oS my heart; and it was Gur intention to have taken our passage in the first ship, which Sailed for Coast and Bay; but Mr. Smyth’s Sudden in-diSpoSition (which by degrees wore a . very alarming aSpedS), induced us to remain in England Some time longer.— It pleaSed heaven, at the expiration of a few months, to re-establish his health,, and as I was at that time far advanced in my pregnancy, rriy kind and attentive Morley, would not Suffer me to undertake the voyage, until I was brought to-bed, and I was prevailed on to remain. Some months; longer.
1 had So dreadful a time, that your father had little hopes given him of my recovery, and he more than once im
treated
[ 135 J
treated them to Sacrifice your lister Delia (whom he now doats on), provided they could, by So doing, Save her mother’s life : but the Almighty, very unexpedl-edly, restored me to the best of hushands^ and my recovery was So rapid, that I was able in a few weeks to Set lail for Bengal: previous to our going, your father was promoted to the rank of colonel.
We had a tolerable voyage, and I was much caressed on our arrival, by the ladies at the Settlement; however ill, it may become me to make the observation, as I mean to recite fadls, I cannot avoid Saying, I was but too much admired by the gentlemen, to remain -long in that state of felicity, I had experienced at the first of my marriage.
Soon
[ 136 ]
Soon aSter my arrival at Bengal, my amiable, my beloved Morley! became So extremely jealous, that I determined to endeavour to quiet any SuSpicions that might occaSion him unhappineSs, or injure me in his opinion, by keeping very little company; by making a point oS receiving no gentlemen in his abfence, but what he had invited ; and by expressing a warmth of passion, which though I really felt, my delicacy had induced me to SuppreSs., Any fond advances on my part, though it will oc-calion diSgust in Some men, had the con-' trary effe<st with him ; and a perSever-ance in little assiduities, purpoSely studied to pleale; paying a particular atten-tention to my drefs, when I was certain of feeing no other man but himSelS, cured him of his ill-grounded jealouSy, and preserved him the most attentive and affedionate of hushands: think on the good effed of this part of my eon-

The regard I feel for you, is the inducement to dwell So Ibng on the dark fide of the canvaSs, and thus boldly paint the conSpicuous error of your life.
It is the duty of a friend, and the indiSpenSible duty of a parent, to present you with the mirror, in which you ,'may view'your faults in their true light;

Set the just value on theSe hints j re* member them, as the admonitions of a parent, who extended her views oS Serving you, even beyond the grave : true fame is not to be purchaSed, but by prudence, nor can it ever be obtained by that admiration, which you unjustly think due to your beauties, and on which at preSent you place too great a value.
I shall request this to be given you, when I am no longer here to adviSe you, trusting that confideration will give any advice or admonition, you may colledl from it, the greater weight; and make the more lasting impression on your heart, when Softened by that af-flidion : I know you will feel on Such an occaSion, and on Such a recent proof of our mortality.

I have wrote this, my beloved daughter ! that you may not be ignorant of her life, who gave you birth, and to shew you how possible it is to remove from the mind of the man whoSe good opinion you wish to preServc, an undeserved Suspicion of jealouSy.—

MY ill-fated, my unhappy Sriend! I can relieve you only Srom your disagreeable SuSpenSe, by plunging you in a more dreadful certainty—Lucy is mar^ ried—she has given that envied perSon to a Mr. Arlington.
I SuppoSe it is a match oS Mr. Cleveland’s making, as the man is almost old enough to be her father, but he is immensely rich.
I can

I can very eafily feel for your Situation; yet, however inhuman it may .-appear, I feel much more for her: indeed she justly claims a large portion of pity. She has Sacnficed- her peace of mind from the laudable motive of conquering a weakneSs, she SuppoSed criminal ; and to oblige a tender parent, whoSe requests in her idea of filial duty, were ever commands.
In a short letter, which she wrote to Mrs. Dormer on the evening of her wedding-day, she acknowledges the receipt of that letter which Fanny'Sent, to inform her you was not married, but does not mention a word of receiving one from you ; as Mr. Cleveland did not reply to it, and she was not married at the time the messenger from you was expedled to arrive in St. James’s-street, I am apt to believe the letter was never delivered. How could this happen ?

BUT that it is uSual, I should think it unnecessary to Say, I wish you all poshble happineSs in the state you arejustentered into: between us two all form and mere ceremony, have been long laid afide as unworthy our mutual friendship: and for Mr. Arlington, he must excuSe me. Saying, I am certain he will be happy with my Lucy, or he does not deServe to be So; and that is a Supposition I cannot admit, for your Sake.
Now
_____________________ _______ i
[ >47 ]
Now I will fall into my uSual stile< and give you Some account of what concerns mySelf, and my friends at this place.
Mrs. Newman has got a fine little boy, and is even better than could be expedted.
Mr. Grenville, who you may remember often Spoke of his agreeable friend at Henley, has been here near a fortnight. Mr. Newman applied to Grenville, wsho was an old School-fellow of his, to purchaSe this little Spot for him, and he kindly viSits it now and then, to give diredlions for any improvements that may be wanted.
The houSe and gardens are fitted up to Mrs. Newman’s and his taste, and does them infinite credit. The houSe is Small but neat, and Situated on an H 2	emi-
[ h8 ]
eminence, from whence, beSides a navigable river, you have a proSpedt beautiful, and of great extent; the country highly cultivated, with a great many elegant villas in view.
The lawn before it is of Nature’s velvet, graSs intermingled with moSs, and embroidered with flowers. What fragrance exhales from the blooming beans! with thefe, the Sides of the Hoping declivity are lined. The moSs Swells into a couch for the repoSe of the body; while the Thames Softly rolling, terminates the view, and Sooths the imagination.
There is a large garden behind, which I can view from my dressing-room window ; in this place it may be justly Said, “ all is beauty to the eye, and mufick to the ear.” The feathered tribe, all joyous and grateful, are paying their
acknow-
[	>49 ]
acknowledgements in a tribute of harmony : but all description is inadequate to the various and innumerable beauties of this little Spot; had I my Lucy with me, I should fancy it ElySium.—I am interrupted-----
It was 3 letter from Mrs. ForteScue— a pressing invitation to be with her at the anniversary, held at the Theatre; it is in one of the finest rooms 1 ever faw, and when crouded with elegant company, must be a very Splendid fight. As it will be a nouveaute to us both* cannot you perSuade Mr. Arlington to accompany you ?—Henley is in your way, therefore if he will agree to the excurfion, you may do the civil thing, by calling for me, and at the fame time have an opportunity of feeing my agree* able friend, your agreeable lover (that was) and be yourSelf a judge how far H 3	this
[ »5° ]
this place Surpasses any thing I have attempted to give you an idea oS.
I think I should like to See Oxford once more:—heigh ho!—Why do I figh So?—but this is a question I do not, Lucy, mean you to anSwer.
How mildly do you treat my Sollies! I will—indeed I will endeavour to be leSs pleaSed with the flattery of the male creatures.—How kindly conSiderate in you, to palliate my errors by laying the blame on the Afiatick manners I had imbibed !—you judge very justly of them : indeed I had been So accustomed to be adored, that I can tell you, I felt mere admiration very inadequate to my expedations on my arrival in England.
I did not give mySelf time to rested (and perhaps my vanity would not permit me to SuppoSe}, there were So many

I THANK you very kindly, my dearest Fanny, for the entertainment you have afforded me, in Sending, me the history of your amiable mother.
I am likewise indebted to you for your last letter, which was, my excellent friend ! just what I wished it to be. So far as concerned mySelf; but I am concerned to find you still Sigh, at the rccolledlion of Sedgwick.
You
[	153 1
You make very .flight mention of Grenville—you do not even expreSs yourSelf pleaSed with So agreeable an addition at Newman-place.T—Is it still So very impossible for you to approve,^ to esteem the amiable qualities of a man^ becaufe he has too high an opinion of your understanding to jiatier you ?
Ah ! Fanny,. Fanny ! have not. I. gueffed at, or rather accounted for, the indifference with which you behold Charles Grenville I—but I am in a humour to be very Severe, and will there^ fore drop the Subjedt.
Though'my time Has been much in* grossed by the ceremonious parade, attendant on my new Situation, I shave had Sufficient leiSure to peruSe Mrs, Morley’s History and your letters, more than once: not that which I received from you the day I was married !—no— H 5	I conu
[ «54 ]
I committed that immediately to the flames, and prayed to heaven, that the remembrance of its contents, might be as eafily and effectually obliterated, as that was destroyed: but it is a SubjeCt which unintentially eScaped my pen, and one, on which in future I will not dare to trust myfelf. I feel it adviSable to encourage dissipation, and as Mr. Arlington is fond of company and public places, it will give me an opportunity to pleaSe him, and in Some degree prevent, “ painful thinking which corrodes our clay.”—
As Mr. Arlington generally reads for an hour in his study before he retires, I have that time intirely to myfelf: not but 1 am mistrefs of it, at any other hour, but I should not chufe to write frequently in his prefence, lest k might be interpreted into a diSreSpeCt, or that he might be offended at my dedicating
So
[ 155 I
So much time to another: indeed, Fanny, he merits all theSe attentions, and though no part oS his conduct hitherto gives me reaSon to SuppoSe he would be dissatisfied with trifles, yet I would avoid Surnishing him with an opportunity of Supposing himSelf flighted. Hi$ whole study is to make me happy, and it is certainly a return but due to him, to let him think I am So.
When I mentioned to him the preff-ing invitation I had received to accompany you to Oxford, he Said, “ he should be happy at all times to give me pleaSure, that he was certain I must be very anxious to See you.^ from whom I have been So long abSent ^ that he had but one objedlion, and even that, if it did not appear to me equally forcible, should be Surmounted : I cannot,” Says he, “ be under obligations to strangers, were they your friends, they must be H 6	mine.

mine, but as we are neither of us acquainted with Mr. or Mrs. ForteScue, I should not chuSe to accept of an apartment in their houSe; beSides, it is not agreeable to me, you should go any where without Servants to attend you, which you cannot take with you there: but as you will, by going, have an opportunity of Seeing your friend Mrs. Dormer, and the gaiety of the Scene may be agreeable, I will accompany you whenever you pleaSe, provided we have apartments hired for us in the town, during our stay, and you shall inSist on Mrs. Dormer being one of our family.”
I then ashed him, if the excurfion was perfedlly agreeable to him ? I aS-fured him the gaiety of the Scene could have no attractions for me, and that 1 would willingly give up the profpedt of feeing my Fanny, Sooner than a6t
con-

contrary to his inclinations: but that I was intirely of his opinion, that it would be disagreeable and improper to be at Mr. ForteScue’s houSe.
“ You are a ,very worthy creature, Lucy,” Said he, “ deSire your friend to, request her’s at Oxford to procure us proper apartments.” He then drew me on his knee, and. kissed me;—L very Sincerely ejieem him, I am under the greatest obligations to him, I both feel—and expreSs my gratitude—but I cannot—it is not in my nature to return his fondnefs.
I am in raptures with the description you have given of Newman-place, and hope very Soon, to have a view of all its beauties.
My father and Sister have just been here, I wished them to add to our Isttle

Newman-place, Henley.
I F your bufineSs requires it, you may return to town without any ap-prehenfions of Seeing Lucy, as she is at preSent under the Same roof with me.
Mr. Arlington and her arrived here three days Since, but as it was my intention to take the first favourable opportunity of entering into a tete-a-tetc with her, I delayed writing, that I
might:
[	i65 ]
might communicate the particulars to you, verbatim et literatim.
Yesterday the weather being very inviting, and the evening extremely warm, Mrs. Newman thought she might venture out (the first time fince her lying-in), and she propoSed our drinking tea in the Temple, which is on the banks of the river, but Lucy objeded, ashgn-ing for reaSon, that the damps off the water, might fubjedt Mrs. Newman to cold.
I shall Second Mrs. Arlington’s ob-jedfions. Said I, and request that we may fip our tea in the drawing-room, and I will favour Mr. and Mrs. Arlington, after the repast is over, to point out the various beauties of this Sweet Spot.— To confeSs the truth, I thought Lucy’s hushand (who is, in Some degree, a valetudinarian), would be likewise fear^
ful
[ ,166 ]
ful of catching cold, and content him-Self with the proSpe£t from the windows : my Scheme fortunately Succeeded, for on my aSking him to accompany us, he Said he wished to be excuScd, but should think himSelf obliged if I would eScort Lucy.
“ I shall not be afraid to trust you together (Said he very facetioussy) notwithstanding I have beard you was an admirer of her’s !■—I think if she could reSign you, and give me her hand, I can have no great doubt, but she conSulted her heart—you know they paint Love as a blind deity, and I think the Sweet girl, when she fancied me, gave no Small proof of it. In possessing her love I posseSs every thing, for as to imaginary wants, no perSon has fewer, and it is my way of thinking, that if we will create imaginary evils to ourSelves, we should likewise create imaginary fatis-^
fadions
[	i67	]
fodions to balance them. It was the merrier phrenzy of the two, to be like the Athenian.^ who Sanded all the ships that came into the harbour, were his own.’*
Lucy looked exceeding embarrassed during the old gentleman’s harrangue ; her countenance changing alternately from red to pale. I felt So Sincerely for the Situation of her mind, that to divert the conversation, I propoSed returning to the houSe: “ Ay,” Said Mrs. Dormer, “ or you will be too late after tea, to view the proSpedt.”
The honours of the tea-table being concluded, I reminded Lucy of her promise to accompany me, and after she had received a Second nod of approbation from Arlington, she very familiarly leant on my arm, and we Sallied forth to the Temple.
I con-
[ .^68 ]
I conduded her into a walk, in which you loSe fight of the houSe. I then told her I was most happy to See her So well reconciled to her new Situation : I am not in the least SurpriSed, Said I, at your paying the neceffary attentions to your hushand, or your esteeming a man, who, by what I have Seen, appears very amiable ! I should be astonished if jtpu were to ad otherwise ; but the mysterious part of your condud, is your marrying any man you did not love.—You confessed to me you had no heart to give ; but you will have Some difficulty to perSuade me, Mr. Arlington was in possession of it.
“ You are mistaken, my worthy friend,” Said she, “ if you think I shall attempt it; I know no meanneSs equal , to that of deceiving another. Not that it follows, I should reveal my Sentiments to every one: if I judged it
impru-
[ i69 3
imprudent to place a confidence, I would be Silent, but I would never be guilty oSdissimulation to a perSon I believed my friend. That kind of deceit which is cunningly laid, and fmoothly carried on, under the difguife of friendship, is of all others, the most impious and detestable.’"
Then, Said I, tell me, whom you have honoured with the appellation ot friend, Who is the happiest of men ? “ Why,” fays she, “ that rnan who has the most fortitude, for he never Suffers his mind to be dejefied with evils.”
Pho, Said I, you “zci//not understand me, but you shall have no plea to evade my next interrogation. Do you not love BoSwell ?
“ You are too particular, Mr. Qren« ville,” Said the dear blushing girl.—

Forgive me, my dear Mrs. Arlington, this once, and you shall never be troubled on the fubjedt by me agairf: but, BoSwell is the friend of my heart, and his conduct towards you must not remain unexplained.
“ Our being abfent So long may have odd appearances; I am very willing, Mr. Grenville, to believe your friend’s condudl may be justified. That Being
who
[ I/I ]
who knows all hearts, can alone judge the innocence of mine. You know your friend passed at our houSe for a married man, why he pradtiSed Such a deceit, is best known to himSelf. The effedts of deception have often proved fatal; but in this instance, his condudl has been a means of rendering a child conformable to the will of a parent. Had I remained Single, I should never have believed it criminal to have loved BoSwell, provided he and the wife I then SuppoSed he had, was ignorant of my regard.— This I knew, and as 1 felt my ill-fated passion prey upon my health—when I Saw an indulgent father worn by affliction, at the fight of his drooping child;
I called reaSon and religion to my aid; and formed the resolution to marry a worthy man, whom my father pointed out to me.
I 2	“ As
I 172 ]
As he was not young, I was the more willing to marry him, as he was more likely to be the improving companion, than the Sond hushand.
Mr. Arlington is nearly Such, and though I now think of your friend very differently to what I formerly did, I have no objedlion to your communicating xo Jiim what I have Said.
I have nothing now which depresses my Spirits, but having deceived Mr. Arlington: yet, 1 think, it would not be adviSeable to make him now acquainted with the Sentiments I formerly entertained for your friend. My hap. pineSs will in a great meaSure depend on Mr. BoSwell: I should not chuSe to be iubjedled to an interview ; and I should hope his own good SenSe, would ididate that it would be prudent in him
to
[ >73 ]
to withdraw, iS ever we should meet ia a public place.”
I had not time to make her a reply, as Mrs. Dormer came to us:—“ Well, Lucy ;” Said she, “ I have been guilty oS a little deceit on your account, but as it was well meant, you must forgive me. Mr. Arlington Sent me half an hour ago, to help you out of the river for he Said by your long abSence, he was afraid you had both fallen in.— Though he Jaid this jeftingly., I did not know but his thoughts might be moro Serious ; So I made him believe I would immediately join company with you r I did peep at you it is true, but as I Saw you apparently in a very interesting diScourSe, I retired, and amuSed mySelf in another part of the garden.”

W E arrived here the day before yeS-terday, and we this morning was charmed with a “ concord of Sweet Sounds !” The justly celebrated MiSs Linley Sung in the Oratorio of Sampfon, which was performed at the theatre.
Lucy, whoSe foul is tuned to harmony, Seemed for a moment to have forgot her cares, and appeared to enjoy the gaiety and Splendor of the Scene. But when that Sweet penSeroSo Song of,
tt Mx
E "79 1
“ My faith and truth O SampSon prove,” &c. was Sung; the gleam of chearfulneSs at once diSperSed from her lovely countenance—she fighed Several times, as if her heart was bursting, and then looked at Arlington.—He Saw the alteration, and Said he was fearful the heat of the place had overpowered her Spirits. “ My delicate little wife!” Said he with great tenderneSs, “ let us retire ?”•—She readily conSented, and Fanny (the only name Mrs. Dormer is known by here) in fisted to attend her friend ; I thought I could not with any propriety quit Mrs. Newman and Mrs. ForteScue, as they were without any other gallant. I knew Lucy had all the company she wished for, (your unfortunate Self excepted) in her Fanny.
On our return to Mr. ForteScue% (where we had appointed to meet) we found colonel Morley, and his daugh-1 6	ter.
[ i8o ]
ter, father-in-law and halS-Sister to Mrs. Dormer.
1 was Surprised at not Seeing my old acquaintance Sedgwick, who, I told you was So enamoured with the pretty Dormer: but we had not been long home beSore he came in. After Swearing in his uSual reprobate way, how
d’----d glad he was to See me ! he drew
a. chair cloSe to MiSs Motley’s, and whiSpered an inundation of compliments ; and though they were Some of them Spoke loud enough for us all to hear, I did not fee MiSs blush, or shew any Signs of diSpleaSure. This Delia Morley is a very elegant girl, and has more regular features than Fanny, but she has an hauteur about her, which is to me very diSgusting.
In a short time Mrs. Dormer, and Lucy, (the latter being charmingly re-I	covered)
[ i8i ]
covered) blessed us with their companies—It was natural to watch Sedgwick’s and Fanny’s countenance, but I could not perceive a change in either of them : indeed the former was So to-? tally ipgroffed by MiSs Morley, and the latter Seemed in So much awe of Lucy,' that it was difficult to know whether she felt any emotion or jealous pangs at his attentions to Delia; I hope she did not, as I am certain he is unworthy her regard; and though she possibly can- . not love her hushand, it is an indiSpen-Sible duty in her and every married woman, to endeavour to SuppreSs a fond-neSs for any other man.
The conversation became too rational to pleaSe MiSs Morley ; at least she Seemed better Satisfied with Sedgwick’s assiduities: I at hast obServed theSe attentions did not paSs unnoticed by Fanny, and on'sher Speaking to Lucy, as I
happened
[ i82 I
happened to paSs the back of her chair, I heard her Say, “ remember, Fanny, you are married—I wish for your Sake he may be in love with her, for perhaps, the flight to your charms will have a better effedl than all my advice, to cure you of an attachment So very unworthy of you.”
After dinner, Sedgwick called me out of the room :—“ What a heavenly girl is this Delia !” Said he ; “ she is as beautiful as an angel, with all the necessary attra6lior>s for a mortal! I thought Fanny a divinity, but the pretty prudish Mrs. Arlington has quite Spoiled her: do for God’s Sake, Grenville, take one of them off my hands
In this manner would he have rim*on until now, had not I put a stop to the conversation. I abhor his principles—
but
[ i83 ]
but he is Such a pleaSant clever fellow, I have not resolution to break with him, yet I never converSe with him an hour together, but I think what a dreadful thing it is, or rather what a miserable folly, to be wife in wickedneSs I
In the evening it was propoSed for us to go to Christ-Church Walk, but as it is the place most frequented, and Oxford is So much crouded just at this time, Fanny Said, she knew her friend Lucy would prefer a strole in Merton Gardens,, which were more retired ; and that if she wished to fee the Beau Monde^ she could view them from the terraSs.— Her proposal was agreed to; Delia, whom I am Sure loves to be admired, consented rather with an ill-grace, until Sedgwick whiSpered—I SuppoSe that they were more private.
Just
[	i84 ]
Just as we were going out at the door, Mi. Arlington flipped down three or •four steps, and Sprained his ancle : Colonel Morley insssted he ought not to walk on it, and offered to remain with him, and let the young people purSue their walk; but Lucy declined it, she Said Mr. Arlington would be more Satisfied, she hoped, with her company, than any other perSon.—I was going to Speak, but she looked very fignificantly at me, and Said “ I chafe to be the perSon to stay.”—This hint was enough for me, and I joined the rest of the party, leaving her to nurSe Arlington :' before we left her, she made us promiSe to Sup at their lodgings, from which place. I am just returned.
BoSwell! I never beheld, her equal; -—If you was witneSs to half the re? straints she is under—to the struggles between her prudence and her inclinations—

I FOUND her alone.—“ You was, no doubt, my friend, SurpriSed at my fending for you, but I am in a most embarrassed fituation, and I think it may be in your power to extricate me from it. I told her she knew she might command my Services, I am well aS-fured of it,’* she replied, “ or I would not place a confidence in you.”
« Mr.

“ Mr. Arlington finds his ancle lb much inflamed, that he Said, as Soon as you left us, he was determined to go to town to-morrow for advice. He is rather timid when any thing ails him, and though Mr. ForteScue has recommended him to apply to a very eminent Surgeon here,—he is So prejudiced against the country praftitioners, that he will not Suffer him to See it.—I had taken Some arquebuSade to bathe it, just before you came in, and he deflred me to order the post chaiSe at eight o’clock to-morrow morning.—1 will go to your father’s” Said he, “ and have Mr. BoSwell to attend me, as he made So fine a cure of him ; and as I have heard him Spoken of, as a very Ikilful Surgeon.

“ I Said I should not be Satisfied to be left behind, but I would return with him.—-I am So agitated, I know not how to a6l, but I will be adviSed by you, if you will promise to be the impartial friend. You may fuppoSe I wish for any Skilful Surgeon to be called in, rather than BoSwell, but I know not how to objedt with propriety : for my father told me before I married, that he should preserve his intimacy with BoSwell, to quell any Suspicions that might ariSe ; for,” fays he, “ as he never confessed a regard for you, and he is ignorant of your unfortunate attachment, I fee no impropriety in your meeting; though I would not invite him when I knew of your being with me.”
After
[ i89 ]
After what your father has Said, I replied, and as Mr. Arlington is in-tirely ignorant of your attachment, it is impossible without raiSing Suspicion, for you to objedt to my friend’s attending him : I would therefore advife you to accept the offer of remaining here ; it will be a confirmation that you pur-poSely avoided an interview with BoS-well, should Suspicion ever be rouSed.
“ You certainly judge right,” Said she, ‘‘ and I will implicitly follow your advice ; I will order the chaiSe at eight, shut I wish you would accornpany Mr. Arlington to town ; he may take it kind, and I would wish him to think well of you: befides, as he knows you formerly honoured me with your partiality;—ilhnatured people may Suggest to him, you are Jiill fond of me.” —Why So I am.

which she withdrew with precipitation. —“ Am I deceived by you P* (Said she in a tremulous voice.) No, indeed you are not, I replied, amiable Lucy ! you will never find me aSpire to more than your friendship, lovely as you are!
BoSwell has too powerful an advocate in this boSom to give any foundation for your fears; you may trust yourSelf fefely at all times with the friend of your lover. “ O” Said she, “ Mr. Grenville ! let me, if possible, forget there is fuch a being exists.—But will you oblige me, by accompanying my Lujband to town ?

MR. BOSWELL T o

Dean-ftreet.
I ACQUAINTED you in my last letter*, with the particulars of that I had Srom my Sriend Grenville.
He came to me about two hours after I wrote, with a message from Mr. Cleveland, to request my immediate attendance at his houfe; telling me, Mr. Arlington was much worSe than when he leSt OxSord, and was defirous to put himSelf under my care,
* Which letter does not appear.
Though
[ 193 ]
Though I foreSaw the distreSs which an interview with Mr. Arlington would produce to your BoSwell, I could not invent an excuSe Sor not going, without giving riSe to various conje6tures in his mind, which might end in Suspicions, injurious to the amiable Lucy:—I therefore determined to accompany my long esteemed friend, to him whom I once fondly hoped to call my father, to the houSe where I have Spent So many happy hours.
On my first entrance, I cast my eyes into the little parlour, where Lucy uSed to fit, when she pradtiSed her muSic, or amuSed herSelf with the pencil;—nothing but the fear of being thought inattentive to Cleveland’s friend, and the glaring impropriety of making my patient wait while 1 apparently amuSed mySelf, could have prevented my touching the keys of that instrument, which
VoL. I.	K	her
[ 194 ]
her delicate fingers had So often preS-fed.
When I opened the chamber door, Mr. Arlington expreffed great Satisfaction at having me to attend him,—I was glad for my Lucy’s Sake, to find his perSon rather agreeable than otherwise ; his manner is eaSy and polite, but not what the French nation would stile, bien poli! for he has no Servility about him.
I am again Sent for,—but will conclude this on my return.
(in CONTINUATION.)
Wednesday Morning,
It was So late when I returned from Cleveland’s, and my Spirits were So agitated with theconfiidl: of my mind, that I was willing to apply to the Restorer
balmy
[ m ]
balmy steep !’*—before I concluded my letter: I am a little recruited, and will now tell you the occafion of my being Sent for.
Arlington’s pain had So greatly increased, that it had brought on a very violent inflammatory fever :—Dodtor
H------, (Cleveland’s phySician) Said I
had with my uSual shill, endeavoured to remove the tumour, but he was fearful the conSequences would baffle our endeavours, and a mortification would Soon enSue.—I do not myfelf thinkfiim in any danger, as he has been a very temperate man, and has a good habit of body.
The melancholy man always'prefages misfortunes, and my next fear is, that Lucy will be Sent for: this fear has its foundation, for MiSs Cleveland Said last night, “ Mr. Arlington had expressed K 2	gteat
[	>96	]
great anxiety to See Lucy ; and notwithstanding she had wrote to him by every post, he was not Satisfied.—My father” Said she “ obServed, that Lucy had better remain at Oxford, as a lick room would add to the depressure her illneSs had left upon her fpirits, and her presence could be no assistance to the recovery of a Sprained ancle : on your account I know he wishes her to remain in the country ;” but Mr. Arlington replied, “ True—even Lucy’s preSence cannot give eaSe to my corporeal feelings or make the inflammation ceafe!—but is she not the friend of my bofom ?—and is not friendship she alleviator of every evil ?—but admitting it were not—It IS fancynot the	of things, that
makes us happy or miserable ; and as it conSists in the mind alone, I cannot conceit but 1 should be better, were she here to nurSe me.”—my father then
Said,
[ 197 ]
Said, “ He would have no wfll but his.”
Now, Delmont, lliould I have an interview with my beloved Lucy ! how shall I be able to condud mySelf with propriety ?—though abSence may cool moderate pashons, it inflames violent ones. Could I but behold her with a Stoical apathy ?—but it is impossible : IS only the fight of the hoiiSe she lived in; the harpSichord Srom which her taste and judgment drew Such ravishing Sounds, could unman me So far as to make me shed tears ? how—how—shall I Support an interview with the woman on whom my heart still doats, knowing her the wiSe of another ?
My Sriend Grenville too, is abSent, when I stood most in need oS his Society ; he is obliged to viSit a dying relation in Devonshire.--Nothing alle-
K 3	viates

viates afHidlions So much, as the privi-ledge of complaining, but I have not time to write half I wish to communicate. Cannot you come to me in the courSe oS the week ?—it is impossible to deScribe the degree of conSolation your company would afford me.

IT is over!—we have Seen each other —Ah ! what means t us palpitation ? what is he—what can he ever be to me? O, Fanny! how I blush at my weakneSs.
The moment he entered the room, I Selt mySelSSo agitated, that I trembled to that degree I could Scarce Support rnySelS;—my Sace Slushed like Scarlet; and 1 was obliged to cloSe the window-shutter at the foot of the bed, to conceal the quick trahfition in my countenance
[ 2°S ]
tenance Srom Mr. Arlington : for I cannot, indeed I cannot, call him my hushand. BoSwell Saw—and Selt my Situation; he bowed reSpedlSully as he pasted me, and looked much more than would have been prudent to have uttered. But, Fanny, how much may be Said without opening the lips! how warm, how tender the Sentiments that may be communicated, without the cold interpofition oS Speech !
When he approached the bed, he told Mr. Arlington he looked infinitely better. “ I am So, I thank God,” Said he, “ but my wife,” an appellation. I wished at that moment he had not uSed, “ will not permit you. to See me, she has made the room So dark.”—After Seeming in doubt what he should call me, BoSwell Said, it was. a very prudent precaution, as the light was toa strong before for a Sick room, but that
he
[	2o6	]
he wished Mrs. Arlington to leave the apartment, as he was pressed for time, and should chuSe to examine his ancle.
How considerate, how delicate the propoSal! I was going to withdraw, when the contrasted Mr. Arlington called me back. “ Stay here, my love, what falSe delicacy is this ; Mr. BoS-well forgets how we are Situated,” the unfortunate young man, fighed and shook his head at this falSe impeachment of his memory, “ or he would never SuppoSe you was afraid to See my ancle.”—When he had made this indelicate observation, I heard BoSwell Say, for I was on the other fide of the bed, the curtains drawn between us; “ You do not stand in need of a fresh applicar tion, and I am happy to inform yoUj you have no farther occafion for a Surgeon ; Dodfor H—— will, I SuppoSe, order you more medicines to brace you,
and
[ 2°7 1
and I hope a few days will restore you to perfedt health.”
Mr. Arlington expressed himSelf in the rnost grateSul terms Sor the Speedy cure, and Said, “ Though I loSe the Surgeon, may I not hope for the pleasure of retaining So agreeable an acquaintance ?” “ You do me honour*^^ was all the reply. Mr. Arlington requested his acceptance of a twenty pound note, at the fame time apologizing for the SmallneSs of the fum : BoS-well, what his motive was I cannot tell, persisted to decline it; Saying, he had too many obligations to Mr. Cleveland, to receive a pecuniary reward, for any trifling Services he had been fortunate enough to render to any part of his family, and retired with So much precipitation from the room, that it was impossible for Mr. Arlington again to Solicit him.
When
[	2o8	]
When BoSwell was gone, he called me to him : “ This is a very extraordinary young man, Lucy! to reSuSe being paid for a cure which is within the line of his profession : if he frequently pradlifes this unuSual genero-Sity, pray how does he live ? has he a fortune independent of buSineSs ^ and pray what mighty obligations has he to your family ?
I told him I knew of none, unleSs he thought he owed Some gratitude to my father, for having fpoke favourably of him in his profession, and having introduced him into Several families: that I had never heard he had any fortune which could render him independant of bufineSs, and that his refuSing the note, was totally unaccountable.
. He is. married, I think. Said. Mr. Arlington, I recolledt your father told
me
[ 2°9	]
me he was parted from his wife. How fortunate for me he was not Single, So amiable—So accomplished a man ! had he been free to chuSe, being So intimate in your family, would probably, have had a prior claim to my lovely girl! —but you are an excellent creature! and at least have made a prudent choice; you have fixed on a man, whofe every wish of his heart, points but to your happinefs—am I fuccefsful, are you happy
Nobody, I replied, more fenfible of my obligations to you ; and you know it was my choice to marry you.—The bell Summoned us to dinner, and relieved me from a conversation, on which
I must leave you to comment.-----You
will observe my reply was laconick ; I thought it most prudent for abhorring dissimulation : by Saying what I did, I
avoided
[ 210 ]
avoided exceeding the bounds of fince-rity and truth.
But " the inconceivable torture of a bleeding heart, reproaching itSelf with unSuSpefted crimes! How depressing and insupportable the burden of unmerited praiSe, and of an esteem, of which the heart is confeious it is unworthy 1”

Is it not the baSest of passions, to like what we have not, and flight what we poffeSs ?—Yet I do think this Sedgwick will break my heart. But were he to Sue for my forgiveneSs, it would be in vain, for I can never forget his treachery.
I believe Rochefoucault was right, when he Said that “ Women can Sooner forgive great indiScretions than Small infidelities and fince he has proved Such a dissembler to your Fanny, I wish he and .Delia were married : there would then be a period to all my expedtations, whereas I now one moment hope, the next deSpair.

Sence has cured him of his ill grounded jealouSy, it shall not be my fault if we are not happy. I am Sure, in Some reSpeds, he is more amiable than Sedgwick, for he never deceived me.

their offspring must prove the medium oS perSedlion : befides, Delia is near Seventeen, and she will be past her prime if she waits much longer; and I think it is time she was married.
I am of her opinion, but Sancy, Sir William, will be too late; I mean Sor her heart, but perhaps her perSon will be Sufficient, and all he may be ambitious to poffeSs.
I thought I heard a Scream, and looking off my paper, I perceived Sedgwick and Delia at the further end of a walk, oppofite the window where I am now writing: she was fitting on his knee, with one of his arms round her waist, his other hand placing Some flowers in her boSom, what occaSioned the Scream I can only gueSs at, but he very Soon stopped her breath.—Ah ! what a Scene!—yet I envy her not the

St. James’s-Street.
M R. Arlington is So well recovered, that he talks of going to Harley-street in a day or two. When we return to our houSe, I will give you my Sentiments on your last letter, but at preSent I am incapable of writing on any Subjeft of So trifling a nature as the conversation of Delia.
No longer attempt to follow my example, for whatever prudence you might formerly think I poffeffed, I do affure you it no longer exists.
Mr.
[ 223 ]
Mr. Arlington last night expreffeci an inclination for a rubber at whist: he is as fond of cards as my father— you know my averSion to them—but knowing if I declined, w'e could not make a Set with our own family, and as I was not in Spirits, to wish for the company of strangers, I Set to the table without shewing any reluDance, and having your friendly and well-judged admonitions in my memory, I intended to appear quite allegro, and had dreff-ed my face with Smiles, that I might appear confistent in my new affumed charadler: we waited a considerable time in expectation of my Sister; our patience being exhausted, my father Sent her maid, to deSire her to come down ; but she, pleading a flight indiSpoSition, declined it: I then went mySelf to her. I found her lying down on the bed, she complained of a violent head-ach, and fickneSs at her stomach ; “ bur,” Said L 4	she,,
[	224	]
she, “ I v/ished to avoid mentioning my indiSpoSition to my Sather, Sor when I complained of my head, Dodlor H— told him, iS I was not better Soon, I must loSe a little blood ; you know it IS an operation I have never undergone, and though my Sears are groundleSs, I cannot get the better of them, and I am particularly careful to avoid it, until you are gone to Harley-street.”
How kindly conSiderate in her ? to avoid my having another interview with the too amiable BoSwell! for that by her manner and hints, was the motive for concealing her illnefs.
When I went down, Mr. Arlington expressed great impatience at my stay, but my father, with his uSual good-humour, obServed, that “Maria might have Some very important matter to communicate.’*
At
[ 225 ]
At that instant there was a loud rap at the door, and the Servant announced the name of BoSwell.—“ This is just what I wished,” Said Mr. Arlington.— My father accosted him with his accuS-, tomed kindneSs, yet Seemed for my fake, to wish he had not come. You may gueSs how much I was SurpriSed, by a vifit from him.^ who had formerly given every proof, that he wished to decline them.—He started back at his first entrance, and it was So apparently at the Sight of me, that I was terrified, lest Mr. Arlington should have obServed it. My father looked So much vexed at his behaviour, that BoSwell See;med to think Some apology necessary.
“ This is a pleaSure, Mr. Arlington, I did not expeD,” Said he, “ 1 was in hopes you was So well recovered, that you was returned to Harley-street: on my word, I was. in debate whether I L 5	should
[ 226 ]
should not give your houSe the preference, until gratitude pulled me by the fieeve, and Said, Cleveland has a prior claim. This determined me, and you lee—you See,” Said he, stammering, “ how I am rewarded.”
“ Come,” Said Mr. Arlington, “ we enlist you for a fourth,” clapping him on the shoulder, “ not to Serve the king, but to make four kings SubServient to you.”
“ With all my heart,” he replied, “ but as the hushand should not be in opposition to the wife, nor the father to the child, I claim the lady for my partner.”
It was agreed.—-Now though you are better acquainted with me, than any other perfon, nay know me Sometimes better than I know my Self, you
can
[	227	]
can form no just idea of my feelings during the game: we were both So inattentive, that we lost considerably; my eyes involuntarily strayed acroSs the table, which a man of leSs penetration than Mr. Arlington must have observed ; yes, Fanny, he faw my embarraS-ment, the other two ft It it. Mr. BoS-wcll apologised Sor his inattention, but declared his head was So confuSed, that he wished to be excuSed playing longer. “ I dined with my friend Dclaiont,” Said he, “ at the ShakeSpeare, and very imprudently drank too much Port wine, it never agrees with me, and though I am mot absolutely drunk, I am in Some degree intoxicated.”'
My father kindly. propoSed his retiring, and Said he would be very well. aSter a night’s rest, and the Sooner he applied to the remedy the better.—I think So, indeed,” Said Mr. Arlington,, L. 6	“ for
[ 228 ]
“ for he Seems to have lost all his Spirits, and eclat for company already.”
My father then pressed him to have a coach, which he refufed, faying the air would be of Service to him.
Fanny ! he looked really ill, and I very imprudently propoSed the Servants going with him. ‘‘ See,” Said Mr. Arlington, “ what it is to be a hand-Some young fellow, even my wife is anxious for your Safety.” This he Spoke with a Smile, but not with good-humour.
BoSwell retired, but left the better-part of him, 1 am Sure, with your Lucy. —Mr, Arlington was Sullen the rest of the evening, and my poor father thoughtful: I Soon renred, on pretence of viSitirig my Sister’s room before I
went
[	229	]
went to bed, but in reality to give vent to my bursting heart.
Surely, Fanny ! I cannot long Survive theSe conflicts.—If Some are refined, like gold, in the Surnace of af-fiiclion, there are many more that, like chaff, are conSumed in it!-—God only knows how I have struggled with my ill-fated passion—-it was unfortunate— it is criminal. I married to obey an indulgent father: I thought in Mrs. Arlington, to have lost the feelings of Lucy Cleveland.
Though Mr. Arlington is petulant, and has many foibles, he has few faults; though it is not in my nature to love him, I may Say, without deviating from truth, it has been the study of every hour of my life, Since I have lived with him, to pleaSe him.
Un-
I 23° ]
Unfortunately for me, he would have Bofwell for his Surgeon, he thought him So humane. So SenSible, So agreeable, that he Sollicited his acquaintance.—I who had began the talk of endeavouring to love my hushand—I who had determined never to See BoSwell, lest I might wish mySelf his wife—am deS-tined to repeated interviews, and Sub-jedled to Such trials, as I confeSs my Self unequal to.
At times I determine to make Mr. Arlington acquainted with the state of my heart, to request him to let me retire to bis country-Seat in Essex, to have no Society but his; and by contemplating his many virtues, forget there is my refradory heart still believes more amiable.-—
Then again, I expoSe my father, who deceived Mr. Arlington, when
he
[ 231 ]
he accepted the alliance; and the violence of the latter’s temper, will never Suffer him to forget the injury ; perhaps he may SuSpefl I confeSs but half my crime, and that his honour is already injured.
In one word, I am distraded, I am ill, my constitution was never strong, and the repeated agitations of my Spirits, will perhaps releaSe me from all my troubles.
There are a great many miSeries, which nothing but death can relieve, and I look on my afflidlions to be of that nature, which can hope for no other remedy.
Why should I wish to remain here, when I am no longer capable to adviSe... my friend.?—I an example!—no: I
am
I
[ '232 3
am a wretch unworthy even of your pity.
Ah, BoSwell !—yet he is not culpable.—Farewell!—
I am blind with my tears.

W E returned here the morning after the painful and embarrafing Scene I painted in my last. Mr. Arlington expressed much joy at Seeing me once more in my own habitation.
“ I have Such pleaSure,” Said he, “ in refiedling, it has been in my power to place you in Such a Sphere, and to See you have every thing that money can purchaSe, that if we have health, my Lucy, we shall Surely be the happiest of human beings!

I wish for nothing more, I replied, and I take Heaven to witneSs it! than your Society ; I wish but to render my-Self agreeable to you (it, on the instant, occurred to me, that I might avoid any future interviews with BoSwell, by a proposition that would confirm theSe assertions, therefore Said): as a proof
C|f

of it, let me propoSe our quitting town; you Say you have a very pleaSant houfe in the neighbourhood of Chelmsford, I am told it commands Some very agree^ able proSpedls: I am very fond of the country, and shall there have an opportunity of enjoying our rational conversation, I can there have the additional Society of my much-loved Fanny, and-----
“ Say no more, my worthy girl,” Said he, interrupting me, “ no request of yours, but what shall be immediately complied with, you are all I wish you, and, as far as it is in my power, you shall be possessed of every defire of your heart, and then I shall enjoy all the fond expedations of mine.—I am fond of London, I confeSs, but even that place without my Lucy, would be a de-Sert; will you, without reludance, stay only until the latter end of the week ?

as I have Some buSineSs to tranSad which I do not chuSe to trust to my steward.-

“ You are,*’he replied, “ every thing 1 wish you, and want nothing to render your countenance Superior to any woman’s I ever Saw, but a chearful aSpedl: but the country will work wonders, and the experiment shall be made very shortly.”
Your

Your letter was then brought me, “ There,” Said he, “ I will now leave you, you cannot want company, when you have a letter to peruSe Srom your dearest Sstiend.”

YOUR letter, my best beloved, my unhappy Sriend ! needs no reply; I can neither adviSe you how to conduct your-Self, nor Say any thing that can conSole you in your preSent critical Situation. All I shall endeavour at, will be to amuSe your mind, to make you, if poS-Sshle, Sorget, though I cannot remove your cares.
We returned to this Sweet place a few days Since; and Delia left Sedgwick,
[ 239 ]
wick, without betraying that concern I d'd SuppoSe she would have felt on the occaSion. He handed her into the coach, and left me without an eScorr, had not my father with his accustomed politeneSs offered his Services.—But believe me, Lucy, my pride was on this occaSion more wounded than my heart: indeed, Sedgwick appears leSs and leSs amiable every day : a proof how impoS-Sible it is to love any objedt long, after.. we are affured another woman is preferred.
I begin to be very anxious for Mr. Dormer’s return ; and as I have not received letters by the last ships, I am Sometimes apt to believe he means to Surprise me.—But to return to Delia, who I assure you has made no Small bustle in this village.
The
I 240	]
The night after she came, Mrs. Newman invited Sir William Selby, without informing him of the company he was to meet. He was, as every man must be at first fight, attrarsted with Delia’s charms; and as far as I can . judge by his behaviour to her, it will be her own fault, if she is not very Soon Lady Selby.
She ran into my room this morning, and Seeing me thus employed. “ Lord,” fays she, “ what can you have to write about ? I believe you tell Mrs. Arlington of every new cap that comes from WilkinSon’s.”—Upon my word. Said I,
I never heard of fuch a millener.----
“ No !” Said she, “ but why should I be Surprised ? how should you, who Sit like Lady Grace, Soberly under Some great tree, be a competent judge of the SIon F—But my dear, that you may not
appear
[	24t	]
appear quite So rusticated a creature when you come to London, I will be So Sriendly as to inform you, that you ,would be laughed at by people of fash-shion, if you was to purchaSe a cap be-cauSe it pleaSed your fancy. There are a few milleners about town who have a Name-, and if you was to appear in the female parties, in a cap of Some woman’s make who nobody knew, you would Subjed yourSelf to their Severest SarcaSms.
“ Why, what a vulgar wretch ! Says one; she has absolutely an opinion of her own ! Says another: in short, my dear. Mrs. Dormer, if you stay much longer out of the polite circle, it will be a difficult matter to polish off the rust you will have acquired. But I must know what you can find to Say to your favourite Lucy? Tell me, have you been dcpidling my Adonis ? O Ciel! what
VoL, I,	M	eyes?
[ 242 }
eyes ? what hair !—then Such a mouth! ornamented with two Such rows of ivory !”
For heaven’s Sake, Delia, Said I, moderate your transports; have you Soug.ht for no farther recommendation in Sir William Selby, than merely the charms of his perfon ?
O yes, yes,” Said she, “ I have not forgot two other very great effentials, his and hhfortuneP
What a poor Knight ! Said I, when you have a Duke in your train ?
“ I tell you,,” Said she, I will marry Sir William, if it. is only to Spite his rival, who is absolutely a baboon com-' pared to Selby ; and I shall, then have the Satisfadfion to SeO his Grace ready to hang hiinSelf for his non-cbahnceP
Her

Her Sather callrstg her, relieved rhe from her tireSome and irrational conversation. But I cannot help expreS-fing my concern at her being likely to be the wife of Sir William Selby. A man, wliorfi one would SuppoSe, had Se-ledled the unexceptionable parts of Lord Chesterfield’s letters to his Son, and formed his mind and manners on their plan.
I think his perSon is notunlike BoS-well’s ; but though his face is perfedlly agreeable, it wants his piercing eyes and aquiline nofe to render it to my taste equally handSome.
I have Seen my father Since I described Selby’s perSon, and have learnt from M 2	his
[ 244 ]
his conversation, that he highly approves oS him for a Son-in law.
“ Do you, Fanny,” Said my father, “ uSe your influence with Delia, to throw no obstacles to impede the match, I wish she was already married; I have my reafons.*
Before I could make him any reply he left me.—It is a proof he knows little of either of us, to SuppoSe any thing I could fay would influence her : but I believe there is no fear of her repulSes, if Sir William fliould exprefs a wish to have the marriage Speedy. They have not been acquainted more than one month, and Mrs. Newman just told me, matters had been Settled So expedition fly, that a Set of pearls was already , beSpoke for the wedding : as likewife an elegant vis-a-vis, in the last taste : I would have frenchified the expression,

Though I See a thouSand faults in the girl, yet as the daughter of Colonel Morley^ I must wish her happily Set-led. Sir Vfilliam has known her So short a time, it must be difficult for him, or her, to know the true Situation of their hearts.—I hope he loves her, M 3	for

[	249	]
of what does the card table remind me? how weak and irreSolute is woman !

I am Sorry to find the Colonel is for precipitating the match : as to his wishing her married, you may de-' pend it is in conScquencc of the observations he has made on the behaviour betweeri her and Mr. Sedgwick.
When we judge most favourably, we allow her to be forward, and coquettish, two very dangerous qualities in a handr Some young girl. Not that I can ev^en \ admire her face, you may stare !—But: let a woman be decked with all the embellishments of art, or giftsof Nature,, yet if boldneSsos So strongly painted in M. 5	her

Colonel Morley is
much to be pitied ; I fear she will prove a great affiidtion to him,—I think it would be but kind in you to inform him of the Scenes you have been witneSs to between her and Sedgwick, before he presents Selby with her hand,
I have Sent you the books you have often expreffed a wish to read, “ The Beauties of ShakeSpear collected.” I think there is too great a Similarity in, our tastes, for you to approve their being fslewed.■^Such a noSegay of Sweets I i	is

JUST as I had concluded my last letter to you, Mr. Arlington came to me in my dressing-room, “ Come, Lucy,” Said he, “ Sor once study which cap is most becoming ! There is an old friend of mine (though a young man) coming to dine with me, and promiSes to introduce his wife to you ; he declares she is the prettiest woman in England : but as 1 have Some thoughts of disputing that point with him, 1 deSire you will not leave any thing negledted that may Support my argument; the

ExcuSe me, my love, I own it a foible, but I cannot help being vain of your perfon\ though I allow good fenfe, good humour, and complacency of temper in a wife, outlive all the charms of a fine face, and make the decay of it in Some degree invisible.**
Well, Said I, assuming an air of gaiety, you shall fee what a divinity I will make mySelf; but you must not be So lavish in your encomiums on this perSon
of
I 254 I-
of mine, SuppoSe I should grow vain and coquettish in my old age ?
“ Excellent creature ! there is witchcraft in your Smiles—but I must leave thee, or you will not be dressed, to receive our guests.”—Not until you tell me their names. “ Haliifax,” he replied, “ He is a Captain in the East-India Company’s Service.”
This left me no room to doubt he was the very perSon, who cauSed your abrupt departure from town ; and I was extremely glad I had never mentioned the circumstance to Mr. Arlington, for as they are acquainted,' it might have been communicated.
He came according to promiSe, and introduced Mrs. Hallifax. She is a little woman, has a very fair Ikin, though not a fine texture; pale languishing
blue
[ 255 ]
blue eyes, and regular Seatures; in short, her face is as pretty as an inanimate one can be : she wants that eafe^ which is So effential to make a perSon really the gentlewoman. She has the appearance of a perSon bred up in the country, and unuSed to company, who wishes to be thought a lady of ton* She declared she was extremely delicate in her constitution, and I am certain, thinks nothing lb vulgar as rohufi health.-^She reminded nie of thofe lines in the love of fame.
The languid lady next appears in date.

It is true I know little of her, but one thing particularly diSgusted me, which was her lovitig me excefftvely after being five hours in my company.
When they were gone, Mr. Arlington paid many compliments to my perfon, too flattering, not to Say fulSome, to re< peat. He was absolutely in a passion
at
I 257 ]
at Hallifax daring to Say, his wife was as handSome as mySelf: “ I am Sure,” Says he, “ though she is a Simpleton,
, she has more art than innocence about her.” Dear Mr. Arlington, Said I, how can you judge So cruelly on So flight an acquaintance ?
“ O, I can See into peoples characters very Soon, and I am Seldom mistaken in the opinion I first form : every one Says, he married her for her pretty face, and she him, to be mistreSs of an elegant houSe. He told me himSelf, ■ that he run away with her from a clergyman’s houSe near Chelmsford, where . she was placed by her guardian, an old crusty hunks, who wished to marry her himSelf, that he might be poffeffed of her fortune.
When I enquired who was her guardian, and what her fortune was ?—He
Said,
I 258 ]
Said, it was* very little conSequence ta him who he was, or what money she was intitled to ; it was the lovely girrherSdf he wanted the possession af, and that he had obtained but to tell you the truth, continued he, I believe her connexions are not the genteelest in the' world, and what little money she may have in her guardians hands, I, at her request, consented she should relinquish to her Sister, by way of a marriage por-rion.forsher ; iri short, I wasreSoived to> agree to that, or any thing elSe, to ^void being pestered with a tribe of people claiming relationship, which. Situated as Yn&'W am, I should blush to own.”
I agreed with Mr. Arlington, that this atiecdote related by Gaptash Hallifax, is of a very extraordinary nature; but he Says he is So thoughtleSs a charaXer, and frequently aXs with Such precipitation, that it is like enough to be true.
But

But the most agreeable intelligence to me, was his declaring it his intention to quit town next Monday.—I told you, Fanny, in my last, I would go to my Sister’s ; but on refiedion, I think, it will be more prudent to fendr—I will endeavour while I remain in town, to shun my Sather’s houSe, though it contains two Such worthy beings; Sor may not BoSwell happen to be there ?—and once more meet with,

THE END OF VOL. L

I should probably have Sell a vidlim to his intreaties, had I not dreaded theSor-Seiture oSLucy’s friendship.
Reflection has convinced me, that had I been wretched enough to have been longer blinded by niy criminal affection, I should have been Severely pu*-nished, by the loathing which would have Succeeded thoSe SenSations, to which I had lacrificed my honour.—You know my favourite Rousseau Says, “ There can' be no pleaSure in any enjoyment which the heart cannot approve, and which tends to fink in our estimation theoyedofour love. Abstrad the idea of perfedion, and our enthuSiaSm vanishes : take away our esteem, and love is at an end.”
Indeed, I fear the too culpable Delia, has lost her honour, without finding felicity. For though I once Saw Sedgwick L 2	through
[ 220 ]
through a SalSe medium, I know not a man more likely to deSpiSe her, Sor the confidence she has placed in him.—Ah, Harriet! what a different charader is to your Sriend Grenvilld.% ?
Seymour, who is at my elbow, inSists I do not write another line to you, until I can inSorm you of his union with my Lucy;—I will comply with the worthy creature’s commands, as So short a time will elaSpe, beSore you will again hear.

Brentwood.
THE amiable lovers are united, they were married this morning by a Special licence at her father’s houSe, and the late MiSs Cleveland, has entitled herSelf to the name of Delmont, which I will venture to Say, she has long wished for.
It was agreeable to all parties that vve should Set off for Delmont Hall, as Soon as the ceremonies were over, and you will perceive by the place I have dated L 3	this
[ 222 ]
this from, that we are So far on our way.
You will naturally think it extraordinary that I should find time to write on fuch a day, and even before we are arrived at our journey’s end, but the two pair of lovers are best company for each other, and Mr. Cleveland has taken this opportunity, to call on a gentleman in this neighbourhood, en paffant.^--
“ Where is Grenville, you will fay ?” —In a corner of the room viewing a print of a horfe race, to appear once my friend, for I believe his mind very differently employed—poor man ! how 1 felt for him at the moment, when the clergyman pronounced Seymour and Lucy, man and wife:—I wish; but I am married, and are Saucy----there-
fore I will not tell you what I wish.
A pen
[	223	1
A pen and ink (the sheet oS paper I must pay Sor) stood So invitingly ready, —that as I had no perSon’s hand to Squeeze, nor any body to gaze on with rapture, (you may believe me Harriet)
I thought I could not adopt a better mode of employ, than Satisfying a friendly curioSity.
We should not have stopped here, but that the gentlemen conceited their brides would be famished if they did not take Some refreshment before they got to Delmont’s*
Lucy, whom I never before Saw partake of any fort of cakes, has just aci cepted a piece, but obServe, Seymour requefled it, and I believe if the truth was known, she would prefer gazing oii him, to partaking of the greatest dainties his inclinations could procure her;
no
[	224 ]
no wonder,—Sor he is indeed “ made up of love and charms, whatever maid could wish, or man admire.**
The carriages wait—adieu for the prefenr.
Delmont-hall, TueSday midnight,
WE have Spent the day in a most jagreeable manner ; friendship, polite-neSs, and elegance, eonSpired to render the whole absolutely inchanting, but as I never poffessfed the happy art of description,—expedt not impossibilities.
You have heard much of the beauties of this Spot, but it is as impossible for you to form, as for me to give you a just ideabftheimmenSity of taste, which
was
[ 225 .1
was displayed throughout the whole entertainment of the day.
With what a greedy impatience did Seymour explore the beautiSul Symmetry of his wife’s perSon ! indeed, she appeared more than uSually lovely on this day :—her hair without powder, and her whole dreSs So very becoming, that you would be at a loSs to know, whether her dreSs gave additional charms to her beauty, or her lovelineSs gave additional beauties to her dreSs.
Seymour appeared tlie gentlemans which is in my opinion. Saying more in his favour, than telling you what every body who has Seen him muji know— that he is hand Some.
He looked, as you may SuppoSe, arrogantly happy-—and, just before Mr. Cleveland retired to his apartment,
the
[ 226 ]
the enraptured Seymour caught Lucy in his arms, and exclaimed—
** O my heart’s joy !—my foul hath her Content fo abfolute, that not another Comfort like to this, fucceeds in unknown fate,”
Good night, my amiable friend, I could al most be cruel enough to Say, I am tired of feeing others happy 1 must invoke the drowSy god

AS I hear your little boy is perfeAly recovered, I shall not admit of an ex-cuSe for your remaining a week longer in the country: I am Sure, your amiable Harriet has been Secluded long enough from the gaieties of the town. You, and yours, are most anxioussy wished for, by Seymour and his lovely Lucy: there are apartments fitted up for all their friends 5 I do not mean nominal
[ 228 ]
nominal ones-—but the approved friends
of their heart.----Being mine you are
theirs—but let me request you to have a town refidence in their neighbourhood, and I will promiSe to makfe it my home during the winter. My friendship for you, prior to my knowledge of him, will be a reafonable, and indeed, the only reaSon I can assign, for not accepting his offer of a continued accommodation in his houfe.
It is generoiis in him to make the offer—I know he means it as a proof of that confidence, which I believe I shall never abuSe ; but, Newman, I have no apathy to boast of, therefore I would 2,w<I\d temptation.
I was unfortunate enough to be re-jedled by the only woman I ever loved f but when she confeffed with So much
candour
t
[	229	]
candour and liberality, that her heart was not in her possession, and afterwards acknowledged, the friend I most esteemed, was the objed: of her affedlion.
I determined to SuppreSs all Selfish views, and devote my whole attention to the means of establishing their hap-pineSs,
Mr. Arlington died, and Providence has Secured to them the felicity of an union, as a reward to their constancy and many virtues.
S I know not So amiable a pair!: but Lucy is still too charming: the shaft of envy will rankle in my bofom, and my reaSon Suggests that it will be more prudent to, reSide with you, and viSit Mrs, Seymour, the wife of my friend., than be the constant, companion of her,, whona

Delmont has taken a houSe in Graf-ton-street, but I fancy he will Spend the chief of his time in Essex, as both him and Mrs. Delmont, are very partial to their villa.
Arlington Grove is to bediSpoSed of, at Mrs. Seymour’s request, and they intend to ramble about next Summer; but I have Some notion, they will look out for a future country refidence in your neighbourhoood, as Lucy often Speaks of the fituation of your houSe with infinite pleaSure.

THOMAS NEWMAN, ESQ;,

CHARLES GRENVILLE, ES(^
Newman Place, Henley.
BY letters j ust arrived from India, I have receiv-ed the information of Mr, Dormer’s death. The melancholy particulars I will relate when we meet; but I find he was poiSoned by one of ^ the black women whom he had a connexion with. She SufpeXed him unfaithful to her, and in the fitof jealouSy, took that diabolical method of revenge.
I con Sign you the talk, of making his amiable wife acquainted, with what the
world
I 233 ]
world will call her misfortune^ but what we style her releafe.
Dormer has died inSolvent, and she, poor woman, must be totally dependent on Colonel Morley, or Mrs. Seymour. I think she ought to preSer the affistance of the former, as Lady Selby is estranged (and but too justly) from his heart, and she has a very ample allowance from her hushand : indeed, I think it very probable, that Colonel Morley will provide handfomely for Fanny, considering her the daughter of a wife he So tenderly loved.
Bur, I confeSs, Charles, I could wish, you would raiSe this lovely woman from a state of dependence, to that of affluence. I am Sure, she has an excellent heart, a refined understanding, and a beautiful face: I have heard you Say, that she has confessed to you all her
little
[	234-	]
little errors of youth, and that the experience she had purchaSed would make her an excellent wife to a man she lonjed.
We shall be in town about the middle of next week : Harriet’s brother is at Bath, and we shall occupy his houSe until we can meet, with one to our taste.
I perfefUy mderfiand you—and I shall inSist on your being with us in Piccadilly.
Refie6l on that paragraph in my letter reSpedting Mrs. Dormer ; and remember the Satisfadtion your heart will feel, at rendering So worthy a woman happy. Observe what I tell you, if love \s the only requifite to make her a good wife, you will be very happy with her.

f 2' 1,
f could not help being SurpriSed at ?^;hat part'oS your letter, which mentions '^our receiving a viSit from Captain Hal* lifax and his Lady; though it was ab-Surd enough, as it cannot be any thing extraordinary in his being acquainted with Mr. Arlington, when they were both at Bengal at the fame time.—I can Sorefee an advantage that will accrue to your Fanny from this gentleman’s mar-riage.-*^Mr. Dormer will be convinced fhe SuppoSed attachment to me, has not been of that nature to prevent his marrying another ; consequently, I shall not in future put mySelf to the least inconvenience to avoid him : but whatever information you can give me reSpedting his wife, do not omit it.
I have prepared Mrs. Newman, for my departure from hence; who would i not quit for the Sake oiyour company *=*«but when I talk of leaving her, she
puts
[ 3 ]
puts Up her lip and Srowns, and Says, “ crofs creature ! you know Delia is no company ; and if you was not a felfiJJi wretch, you would not think of going to Essex, until Newman is here to com^ fort me : I ant almost destitute of it, I assure you,; and if you forfake me, I shall not only wear the willow, but tie mySelf up to that at the end of the garden.” She then runs to her harpSichord, and accompanies that pretty Song, So applicable to her Situation.
The heavy hours are almoll paft That part my love from me, &c.”
For he is daily expedted, as a letter she received yesterday, informed her, a ship with which he Sailed in company from St. Helena, was arrived in the Downs, and that, in which he is a passenger, may be expedted every hour.—As I have no doubt but your Sister will accompany B 2	you
[ 4 ]
you into Essex, I believe I shall, as I think it due to my lively Sricnd, remain with her until her hushand arrives. —She is a worthy, agreeable creature ; but she is not tny Lucy : consequently, wshen I am an hour from you that I can avoid, it is a Sacrifice of my inclinations to gratitude, or propriety.
Sir William Selby is a very constant viSitor-, he has made propoSals reSpedting Delia, to my father,, and 1 find the latter has accepted them ; So that I Sup-poSe, I shall shortly inform you of their union.—I do not think it adviSable, for me to inform Colonel Morley, of the Scenes I have been witneSs to, between her and Sedgwick : does it not occur to you as an impropriety for me to interfere ? may he not one day hear of my former attachment to Sedgwick ? perhaps, from Delia herfelf, who may be proud to boast of havino; rivalled her
Sister,
[ 5 ]
lister, and may construe my assertions to proceed Srom jealouSy, or at best, Sup-poSe me prejudiced against the parties;
-----notwithstanding the objedions I
have recited, should you approve oS my mentioning what I have obServed,—I will do it. Nothing, that my Lucy ad-viSes, shall be unattended to.
Write as Soon as you arrive at your country refidence.

MRS. DORMER.
Arlington-grove.
I AM Sure it will give you pleaSure to hear my request was granted, and that my Sister accompanied us to this place.—The houle is large and convenient ; and the garden, which Surrounds it, Laid out in a pretty taste; but the Situation is quite a fiat: in short, we are in the vale Surrounded with hills.
■ I observed the other evening from my dressing-room window, a white houSe, which stands on an eminence, and appeared to command a very extenSive proSpedt:
C 7 J
prolpedl: I aficed Mr. Arlington; wha» it belonged to
‘‘ That is a piece of information,’®' Said he, “ I cannot give you ; I mySelf never enquired ;. for as I have Spent all my time Since my arrival in England^ -(except two months) in London, I never attempted to make any acquaintance here.—I bought this houSe, merely, beacauSe a man of my fortune would; have been thought very miihriy, or very-abSurd, to have but one; and I, as yyell as the rest, of mankind, cannot help paying Some little difference rp the world.% opinion : ip short, I purchaSe^ a country Sear, to pleaSe other people, and called it Arlington-groye, from the' yii77z<? motive, and likewife to avoid .the? world’s ‘ dread laugh, which Scarce, the firm philoSopher can Scorn.’—But now_)w expreSs a fondneSs for the country, it will be the chief pleaSure of my B,4	lite
[ 8 ]
life to improve this place, unlels you can fix on Some other Spot, more agreeable to your taste.’*
You are very kind, Said I;—I think this Situation very pleaSant: but what Say you to a walk to that white houSe ? 1 quite long to See it.
“ I have no objedion,” Said he. Smiling, “ So you do not long to See the matf who owns it, to accompanying you.”
No—no, I replied, assuming an air of chearfulneSs, I leave thoSe longings for my Sister.
“ Dearest, best of women !” Said he,
how happy am I to See that countenance wear a Smile !”
Why, you know, I replied, it Was your prophecy, that the country would
“ work
I 9 ]
“ work wonders.”—We then Set out for OUT promenade., and walked about a mile in one of the most plcaSant Evenings, the Summer has produced ; the limes and elms, that are on each fide the avenue leading to our houSe, uniting their branches over our heads, formed a verdant canopy, and cast a most pleaSmg shade : on either fide, the boughs rounded into a Set of regular arches, opened a view into the distant fields, and presented us with a profpeCt of the bending Sky ; while a French-horn, I SuppoSe from Some neighbouring Seat, Sent its melodious accents. Softened by the length of their passage.—We Soon arrived at the houSe, theoutSide of which. Speaks the elegant taste of the owner; as we w’ere then on the Summit of the hill, I was lost in extaSy, and could not help exclaiming
B5	“O
[ 10 ]
O vale of bllfs ! O foftly fwelling hills !
On which the power of cultivation lies!
And joys to fee the wonders of his toil.
Heavens! what a goodly profpefl fpreads around.
Of hills, and dales, and woods, and lawns, and fpires!”
I then Said, taking hold of Mr. Arlington’s arm, come, let us range along the Summit of this gently riSing hill, and catch the laji fmiles of day, before the Vv'hole face of the ground is overSpread with shades; or with v/hat one of the finest painters of nature, calls a dun ob-fcurity.—My Sister complaining she was tired, L Sat mySelf down by her, but Mr. Arlington immediately lifted us both up, and reproved her, jestingly, for shewing So bad an example to her younger Sister; telling her, that the “ graSs being wet, was but a Secondary consideration with her \ as she had the hope, by Seating herSelS there, loattraff Some perSon’s notice, and induce them to I	offer
i[ II ]
. offer her a move, commodious Seat to Test her wearied limbs, after- the insupportable fatigue of vvalking a^whole mileV
“ Well,” faid my-fister,. then I hope , my Scheme has Succeeded, for here is a messenger coming towards us.”
At that instant a footman came uppo us, with his master’s corupliments, and requested the favour of our companies,
V to take a better view of the proSpedt from a room, which was purpoSely . ereded on the top of the houfe.”
As,we were walking up the aveaue,
young gentleman met us.--“ You have given nie great plcaSure,” faid he, ,.‘pat your apparent apprcbation of this fituation, blit you rhust acQept,cf Some refreshment, ]a^nd then oblige me \vitst your companies in my little, pbSery-atpry, from y/hence^you wilLreceive^^a , B6	oriore
[ 12 ]
more adequate idea of the beauty and extent oS the proSpecst.”
We readily accepted, the invitation, and Mr. Arlington, and the agreeable, hospitable young man, Soon became very Sociable:—but as the Sormer is particularly fearful of being deficient in making a return for any civility he receives, he inSisted, if the latter wished to oblige him, he would dine with us the next day at the grove, “ My name is Arlington,” “ and mine,” replied the gentleman, “ is Delmont.”
There was one circumstance I observed, which appeared to me very extraordinary. When Mr. Delmont heard our name.^ he regarded me with the greatest attention.—When we parted, he renewed his promiSe to dine with us the next day; but at the time we expected him, he Sent an apology, assign-
ing
[ 13 ]
ing Sor reaSon that a friend was just arrived Srom London, but that he looked on his vifit only deferred.—
He appears Senfible and polite, and I am Sure he is very agreeable; he Seems a grave charafter, and in that re-Sped the counter-part of Maria.
I have not time at preSent to acquaint you with my defign, but the first opportunity. Je vous en donnerai avis,

AS you Sent your last letter to Har-ley-street, I have but just received it ; but as you have by this time got that which I dated Srom this place, you will perceive I had anticipated your wishes, and wrote from the country immediately after my arrival beSore I became acquainted with your request.
1 have well confidered about yojur Speaking to Colonel Morley, about Sedgwick and Delia; and the reSult of that consideration, is agreeing with you

Were it even possible for you to think of leaving her, theSe doors shall positively be shut against you, until Mr. Newman makes his appearance.----After this declaration, I
leave you to judge, whether or not, I am impatient for his arrival,

But to effc(st this liking, and then improve it into love, he must have opportunities of discovering the excellent qualities of her heart. Her good SenSe, like her perSon, will improve an intimate acquaintance, but will never " strike him or any other man, on the first interview.

As I had received Such pressing Solicitations from Delmont, when he was with me in town, to return with him to the hall, and as my buSineSs would not admit my complying with his request; I was no Sooner informed of my acquisition of fortune, than I determined to Spend the Summer with him in Essex ; at the Same time, reSolving, not to give y ou an item of my intentions, lest your rhetorick should have prevailed on me to remain in the fmoaky metropolis.
The very day I arrived here, noW' Said I, my good, I cannot add my lamented, coufin, has left me Such an elegant Sufficiency, and consequently enabled me to quit the pradice of Surgery —I am come where friendship already
dwells.
[ 20 ]
dwells, in Search of “ content, retirement, and rural quiet;” and have relinquished the best concerts London affords, without regret, forthemuSic of the groves; and I will hope, as a man who is still young, and was once gay, has shewn fuch a preference for retirement. The coy quiristers that lodge within, will be prodigal of their harmony : if not, the fociety of my Del-mont will amply compenfate for their deficiencies, during the Summer which 1 intend Spending with you.
Ah! but Something I have to communicate, will, I fear,” Said he, “ again deprive me of your valued company.-—While I was-eating fome ice a few evenings ago, I thought I heard the Sound of female voices ; and looking through the window, I perceived a middle aged gentleman, raifing two ladies from the graSs on which they
were
[ 21 ]
were Seated : I remembered to have Seen the gentleman before, and SuppoSed it might have been at Chelmsford Church, but I did not know his name, the ladies were both strangers to me.
As they appeared to be in raptures with the proSped, and I had fome little curiofity to have a nearer view of the females, (as the perSon of one of them appeared uncommonly elegant,) I requested the favour of their companies to view the proSped from my observatory.—They accepted my offer without any heSitation ; the gentleman expressed himSelf extremely obliged at the few civilities that I had shewn, and he fo greatly over-rated ; told me his name was Arlington, and in fisted on my dining with him the next day.
Good God ! Said I, interrupting him, was Lucy with him ? or rather 1 should
first
[ 22 1
•first ash, is it the Arlington, Jhe married ?
“ Have a minute’s patience,” Said he, ^ and you shall hear all that passed.
“ He introduced the youngest of the ladies to me as his wife, the other as her fister, whom he called, Maria.—This confirmed my SuSpicions that they were the MiSs Clevelands, as I had heard you Say Maria was the name of the eldeftf^
But, Said I, again interrupting him, is it possible you should not know my Lucy, can any other woman reSemble her .? but do not torture me with Such SuSpenSe ; deScribethe perSon and dreSs of the youngest fister, and I will Soon inform you if it was Lucy Cleveland (I will not call her Arlington) that you have Seen.—To confeSs a truth, Charles, there were too many corroborating circumstances
t 23 I
cumstances to leave me a doubt but k was my Lucy he had Seen, but I wish-^ed to have a description of her lovely perSon from an impartial beholder ^ my Scheme Succeeded, and Delmont replied ;—You forget, Harry, that I had nevery^fwLucy; therefore no great wonder to a man in his right fenSes, that I should not know her: but to proceed to my description of the youngs est lady. She is of the middle fize, exceedingly delicate, languishing blue eyes, a lovely mouth, with a most inviting pair of lips ; and her neck is formed by the hand of harmony: in a word, she is more than painting or Sculpture can expreSs, for she is animated.
Her dreSs was elegantly neat, without the least approach to finery ; I cannot remember any particulars of it except her hat, which was, I believe, what they call chip, and was delicately ornamented,
[ 24 ]
mented, instead oS being fashionably loaded, with laycock ribbon,—her SiS-ter.^---
O, Said I, never mind her Sister,—by your description, it can be no other than my Lucy whom you have Seen; —but did she Speak }—did she appear chearful ?—talk to me about her, for this hour to come.
‘‘ On my word,’* Said he, “ you are very unreasonable; you expedt to be gratified in every wish, and would not permit me to Speak of her lister ; who, perhaps, may have as indisputable charms in eyes, as Lucy has myours: —not that I am So far gone as to be blinded by my love, and imagine the elder Sister’s fer/onal attradtions in any degree equal to the younger; indeed, every woman 1 have Seen, I think inferior in beauty to Mrs. Arlington; but
there
[	25	]
there was a Something in Maria, which makes me wish for a Second interview, and that I had thoughts oS obtaining to-day; for Mr. Arlington gave me a very pressing invitation to dine with him, which I promiSed to accept,—but now you are come, what can I do—will you chooSe to accompany me —
I am half inclined. Said I, then recol-leding mySelf,—no, Delmont—not for the world—the Scene at the card table, ' is still recent in my memory, that interview being accidental I am Sure she has forgiven ; but was I to go preme-ditatedly into her preSence, I might forfeit her good opinion, on which I Set So inestimable a value:—Send a card, and Say, a friend having just arrived from town, obliges you to defer your viSit, and we will afterwards talk the matter over, how you shall manage in future,
VoL. II. c	He
[ 26 ]
He immediately Sent a message to that purport: and Lucy wrote a card, as Srom Mr. Arlington, “ that they hoped his vifit would not be long deferred, and defired his friend might not prevent his pleasuring them with Us company, as they should be happy if he would introduce him at the Grove.’*
It was her writing, and the well known hand did not eScape my particular notice you have Seen her, and felt the power of her charms, consequently, will not ridicule me, when I confeSs, the identical card, has been my nearest companion ;—fince she hangs about my heart, why should not her name be there They wish him to introduce his friend at the Grove !”— Ah, Charles 1 how little do they fuSped that friend is i*
After
I ^7 1
After this behaviour, Delmont can-, not, consistent with good breeding, decline vifiting at Mr. Arlington’s ;—nor , would I wish him,—^for by his intimacy there.^ I shall gain Srequent intelligence of my dear lovely girl!
There is a pretty houSe to be Sold, within fight of this, which I have determined to purchase; for if I remain with Delmont, I shall be liable to meet that angel of a woman! who,—but for my fatal procrastination, would now have been my wife.
As I have changed my name.^ I hope to remain in this village, totally linSuf-pedted. She! the idol of my heart! can never SuppoSe, should she hear Mr. Seymmr 'indiS, her neighbour, that he is that Bofwell whom she unfortunately loved.

I called at Mr. Cleveland’s the evening before I left town, but as he was ' from home,—I request you will go

I am, for all favours received ; tell him of my acquisition of fortune, which enables me to relinquish bufineSs; but at the Same time assure him from me, that should he be unfortunate enough to require any chirurgical assistance, I shall defire him to command my Services. You will request him not to mention my having quitted London, or my having changed my name, to his own f^ mily or to Mr. Arlington.

I approve her choice, as his perSon is extremely agreeable, and he appears SenSible and well bred.

WE are just returned, and I cannot retire to my bed-room, without telling you we have passed a very agreeable day : and oS one circumstance which happened, which I cannot account Sor, and as women are naturally curious, I conSeSs it has ingroffed my thoughts ever Since.
After tea, a walk in the garden was pfopoSed. It was a glorious evening,
the
[ 42 I
the Sun Set with uncommon magnificence, and Soon after the moon roSe in the oppofite quarter, and by her fainter rays, gave new beauties to a fituation, to which all description is inadequate.
After^we had walked a short time, DelmonC propoSed our going in the-field, at the bottom of the garden. “They are milking the cows,’* Said he, “ and we shall have a Syllabub ift perfediond*
When we came there, we found feme garden chairs placed ready for our accornmodation, and on one of them, lay a german flute,.—^As it was on the very chair which was left for me, I put the flute on my lap, which Del-mont perceiving, he offered to take it from me: No, Said I, unleSs you will promise to draw Some tones from it, it may as well be here. He affured me;
he-
[ 43 I
he could not play. To whom theft does it belong ? Said I, “ to a friend of mine,’* he replied, who left me a few days Since.’*
^his was what I wanted to leant, Fanny, for I knew it was the-r^ry flute, I had So often Seen, in our parlour, and which my father, had frequently dcSired BoSwell to amuSe us girls with.
My Sister and Mr. Arlington, was gone back to the houSe in Search of a favourite greyhound; and Delmont invited me into a Summer-houSe, which commanded a very pidureSque view.— I had the flute still in my hand, and had just put it to my mouth, as if I intended to blow it, when I heard a voice (which, if ever I heard his, I think was BoSwell’s) exclaim, Fool that I was !
' —-It is too much !.”---1 immediately
afked Delmont from whence the voice I proceeded.
t 44 ]
proceeded; he affured me he did not know, and looked as much astonished as mySelf.—There was a Small houSein view, and I inSisted Sor Some time, that it must have come Srom thence; but Mr. Delmont Said, it could not be, that the houSe I mentioned belonged to a Mr. Seymour, and that it was impossible a voice could be heard distindUy from Such a distance. My flurry, at what I thought a well known Sound, had prevented my recolledting how im* possible it was to hear from thence.
We partook plentifully of the Syllabub ; but I was foolish enough to be out of Spirits the rest of the evening : I ex-pefted Delmont would mention the circumstance (which had filled us both with So much astonishment) every moment; —but he did not, and I had not resolution to Speak of it: So thoroughly

DELIA is married—and in the title of Lady Selby, appears to have attained the extent of her wishes ; as to the man., amiable as he is, I do not believe she cares a pinch of Snuff for him.

Though
[ 47 ]
Though my father is a very worthy and SenSible man, there is a referee in his manner, which prevents one ever being Sociable with him ; as to Delia, she has ever appeared difgujiing in our eyes ; consequently, we do not regret the loSs oS either of their companies : but the absence of Sir William Selby, is, I affure you, to be regretted; and his time, is at preSent, too much ingroffed by his bride, to admit of our receiving many vifits fromshim.
A letter I have just received from the India Houfe, informs me, Mr. Dormer is well, or to Speak with greater propriety, was So when he wrote. He tells me he has Some thoughts of coming to England, but is not yet abfglutely determined ; he writes in a very affedlion-ate stile, and laments his long abfence from his fweet little womanP theSe are his words.—Why did he fend me to
England,

England, if my abSence was to be lamented —but men are great inconjijien-des.------1 had a letter by the Same con-
veyance, from my Sister, who tells me I have no rivals, but the black ladies, and that Dormer has quite a Seraglio of them.
But this intelligence, Lucy, is not no'uel to me, for he would frequently Substitute one of them in my place when I had offended him ; and if ever I complained of Such an indignity, he would laugh and tell me. If I found “ variety charming, why should not
.?”-^But she assures me, that all his Suspicions of my infidelity, are intirely dissipated, and that he Speaks of me at all limes with the greatest tenderneSs.
He has Sent me a miniature, done from a painting of him, by Kettle, but I do not think it a good likeneSs. I
am
[ 49 ]
am to Set for mine, and Send it to him by the next ships, and yet he talks of coming to England, So I SuppoSe, my pi6tiire is to give him the meeting: but I observed before that men were incon-ftjient beings.
I am engaged at Lady Selby’s this evening, which prevents my converfing with you more at preSent.
Would you believe it} she has Sent the carriage for me, which do you think was the motive to accommodate me^ or honour me with a ride in her new vis-a-vis, and give her Servant an opportunity of announcing Lady Selby^s carriage waits.” Perhaps, Lucy, I may be too ill-natured; but I confefs, I believe I may thank vanity for this piece of civility:—one good thing, I shall not be long teized with her company, for I will venture to fay, when the Play-VoL.

I believed, and hoped, he was in Lon-'dofti but this circumstance almost con-D 2	vinces

vinces me, he is in your neighbourhood. If So—where is his prudence ?
Sir William gave me a very friendly and polite reception at his houSe; but a tete-a-tete which I had with her ladyship, will not Surprise you, but will Serve to confirm thoSe prejudices we have long entertained.
On retiring to her dressing-room to shew me a number of very tasty and elegant lijcus^ which Sir William had purchased for her,
“ Would you believe,” Said she, “ Sir William and I, have had 2^ matrimonial quarrel already.”

Why, Said I, I must confeSs, Delia, your difpofition appears to me So much the reverfe of his, that I am astonished he should ever marry you.
“ O,” she replied, “ I played my cards^ very cunningly, to Secure the title of Lady Selby., and to mortify Some other people who shall be nameleSs I Sup-poSe, she alluded to the duke of H— and the forSaken Sedgwick. “ 1 duped Sir William to Such a degree, that he at last believed me as fond of gloomy groves, dashing caScades, and crystal D 3	streams,

I was going to conSeSs the only circumstance in which I ever deceived my hushand; when my father, guejfing., I imagine, what I was going to Say, interrupted me with a very fig-look, Saying, “ misjudging girl! why torment yoiirSelS with unneceffary fears ? there is no reaSon to deSpair j with the bleffing of Providence, but Mr. Arlington will recover, and that there are many happy years in store for you.**
I was sh exhausted by my own reflexions, and the Scene that was before me, that it was with great difficulty they kept me from fainting.
My father infisted I should exert mySelf, and endeavour to take a short walk, if it was only in the garden; as,
he
I 6^ ]
he Said, the confinement would injure jny health, and prevent my paying a proper attendance on my hushand.
“ Aye,” Said Mr. Arlington, “ be perSuaded, I am better, and.your Sister will give me my. medicine, as you do not chuSe to trust the nurSe, you know I have experienced her care on a former occafion (alluding to the time he Sprairv^p «d his. ancle),.
We had not been long in the garden beSore Hallifax followed us. I had yust received my father’s forgivenefs unSollicited, for my rashneSs, in going to divulge my only Secret to my huf-band, and by way of recruiting his Spirits (which were Somewhat agitated),, I was going to acquaint him with my, observations on Delmont’s behaviour to my Sister, as I knew the proSped of Such a Settlement for her, would give
him
E 67 J
him infinite joy. To deprive him of a. pleaSurable SenSation, though but for a moment, almost induced me to be rude to Hallifax, who had So unSea? Sonably interrupted me.
After bowing to my father, I am come to tell you,” Said he, addressing, himSelf to me, “ that I am not to enjoy the company of my pretty wife (now you will be pleafed, as l am praif?-ing her) for Some weeks longer, as she is going Somewhere in the country, I have forgot the name of the place, to vifit a new-married pair, but she tells me the lady is So very handfome, she win not trust me to accompany her; and as I have no inclination to go to London, until the feaSon is more advanced, you will most likely be troubled with my company, unleSs I must turn out becauSe Mr. Arlington is an invalid.^
I told
[ 68 I
I told him, his own good SenSe wonld point out to him when the abSence of a mere acquaintance would be acceptahVt that my mind was at preSent in Such an agitated state, I could not attend to ceremonious forms.
“ I understand you,” Said he, “ you want me to quk your houSe ; I conSeSs you have adopted a very dvil mode of faying Some rude things.”
My father was provoked, and was going to notice his Speech; but as I apprehended Some diSagreeable altercation would enSue; I pulled him by the Heeve, and he very confiderately on my account, checked his reSentment, and only Said, “■ I SuppoSe Captain Halli-fax is in jest ; he could not mean to affront you, as that would be taking' a paltroon’s advantage of your being- a woman.
He
[ h 3
He made no reply, but taking his leave, wished Mr. Arlington better, and ordered his horSe to be got ready. When he was gone, I related many particulars of his behaviour: my father thought I had afled right in expreffing mySelf as I did to him.	ContemptP
Said he, “ and avoiding his company, is the best reSentment a modeji woman .can shew to a man, who has treated her with diJrefpefiA
On our return in the houSe, my father went up to Mr. Arlington, and I fuSpedl: had related to him what I told him about HalliSax, for when I went into the room, I heard the latter fay, she behaved with her uSual prudence); let me never See his face here again, for”—when he perceived me in the room, he stopped.

THE diSagreeable talk of commu-'Jiicating the most melancholy event I have ever been witneSs to, is referved for me-*you are, by theSe few lines, no doubt, prepared to hear that Mr. Arlington is na more. He was Seized yeS-terday with So violent an attack in hia stomach and head, that nature was foon exhausted, and he died in a very few hours.
Such
I 72 3
Such a Scene ! my dear Mrs. Dormer! is not to be deScribed in any manner, that can give you a juji idea of it.— Our poor fiistreffed Lucy never left his bed-fide. Between the intervals oS his pain, he caught hold oS her hand, which he claSped with Such violence, that it was with difficulty we looSed it. He was Senfible, but SpeechleSs, until within an hour of his death ; and in his delirium, he flung himSelf in her arms, and there expired.
She was not, until my father Spoke, to be prevailed on to quit the body; but reproached^herSelf for the indifference she had felt for him, until very lately, in terms which affedted every perSon preSent.
She fainted twice on our attempting to remove her into another chamber. She had no fleep during the whole
night
t 73	]
night, but appeared to lay in a state oSstu-pefadion. She has a violent Sever, and Ido not my Self believe perfeftly in her SenSes, for she has not mentioned your name, nor attempted to write to you.
Her concern for his death is reaI and however faulty she may appear to the eye of an unfeeling and misjudging world, a want of conjugal ziicntions could never be alledged against her.
Though we know she did not love Mr. Arlington—yet her’s is Such a tender, delicate frame, it cannot well Support any of the boisterous waves of fortune : and I terrify myfelf lest it should prove fatal to her.
I am now writing at the foot of her bed. She calls me,-—Adieu for the present.

YOU are by this time acquainted with m.y lofs. I do not make uSe oS the word 1 have rendered emphatic, merely, as an essential in the firji letter you receive Srom a widow ; but to convey to you the true state oS my Seelings, on the death of Mr. Arlington.—Though he was an objedt of indifference to me at the time I married him, and though I never loved him,—yet his merit, his regard for me, and unabated attentions, produced the effedl I wished for and expected :—A tender attachment; duty D 2	and
i
[ 76 ]
and honour were the bonds by which I was united to him.
I take heaven to witneSs ! there is but one conSolation I can derive, Srom being deprived oS him, So shortly aSter our union : he died ignorant of the wrong done to him by a parent and a child, in giving him a divided heart.
My tender, my indulgent father, shews Such an anxiety at the depreffurg of my Spirits, and Seems So Sully per-Suaded, that varying the Scene, may, io Some degree, diSpel the gloom, which at preSent, in Spite of my efforts, hovers over my mind, that he has obtained my promise, to quit this melancholy mansion ; and accept a refidence with him, until affairs are Sufficiently fettled, to enable me to .determine in what place, and manner^ I shall live in future.—I shall not, therefore, SoUicit your much
loved
I 77 J
loved company, even admitting Mr. Newman is arrived, until I have a home to ofier you : we shall then, I hope, be as ignorant of a Separate interest, as of the regrets which have been occafioned by abSence.
I am Sorry to tell you, that Mr. Dormer’s circumstances are greatly embar-raffed, and that the immenSe Sums he is indebted to the Black Merchants, is the reaSon ashgned for his not quitting India. We had this intelligence from undoubted authority, and I fear it will be but too strongly confirmed, when Mr. Newman arrives.—Indeed, it is proper to make you acquainted with one circumstance, which from motives of delicacy my father has kept you ignorant of—There has been no remittances either last SeaSon or this; but my father being in hopes it was not owing to Mr. Dormer’s inalility^ but perhaps, E 3	his
[ 78 ]
his negligence,^ in waiting until the'Com-pany*s treaSury ^zsjhut., before he applied to remit bills; preServed the expectations of receiving money by every ship that was expeCted in, and was unwilling to tell you, that you stave been entirely dependant on him. He is ig-iTorant of my mentioning this circumstance to you ; though I shall not Suffer him to remain So —but as I know it has been a great inconvenience to hin?, I shall expeCt, and inSist in future, that all your drafts are Sent to me for acceptance. I will not admit of any objections—you cannot make one, but what must be the effeCl of falfe pride.
My father has just folficited Mr. Def-mont to accompany us to town ;—-he Seemed to wait for my JiJiers expressing a wifli for him to accept the invitation; for she no Sooner Spoke to thaepurpoSe, than Delmont bowing reSpeClfully to

niy father. Said, he could not reSist sh great a happineSs as the Society of him and his family; he Spoke in general terms, but I fancy, thought of of the family with 'particular pleaSure. He is extremely amiable, and I only wish he was my brother:—but I at Some times fear, notwithstanding the partiality he appears to feel for my Sister, that the inference I have drawn from his condudf, is more the effedt of my wishes than my expedlations; and that my hopes are destitute of a real foundation. Why should he conceal his affedlion, if he really feels an inclination for her.? and I do not believe he has ever avowed a regard ; but of this I cannot be certain, for as she never mentions him when we are alone, I think there would be an indelicacy, in my first starting the SubjeD, especially, as I believe, she has a very great attachment to him : a circumstance the other evening.

I adviSed him to delay his propoSals for a short time, as I thought he was ignorant of her great deficiency in fortune ; and I knew him a man of too extravagant a difpofition, for it to be prudent in him to marry a woman without fme money.

what

On his knocking at the door (my father, it Seems, Sent him up to me) I naturally enquired, who was there.—“ A friend,” Said he, “ in the stridtest SenSe

I will now, beSore you have an interview, make you acquainted with the nature of his connection, with the per- , fon whom you, and many others, believed to be his wife.
Was there not a young Lady who Jived with him as a wife did he nor. Said I, Seduce her from the paths of vir^ tue, and then forSake her ?
“ Nancy Collins,” he replied, “ w^as his mijirefs\ and latterly, he very foolishly Suffered her to appear as his wife. As she had none but per final attractions,
his

his SondneSs for her, was but of short duration ; though he had many doubts of her fidelity to him, fubfequent to his attachment with her : he had Sufficient •proofs of her connections with other men, prior to their acquaintance.—She had often Sollicited him to marry her, but he was not to be wheedled into fuck an union.
She at last had recourSe to an expedient which in shme meaSure Succeeded to her wishes. She affured him she yt2.^ pregnant. This circumstance, added to her tears and intreaties, prevailed on him to conSent to her appearing as his wife, though he Solemnly Swore never to marry her.
“ It was about this time, he became acquainted with Mr. Cleveland. He had known MiSs Collins and her family, long before her connexion with Bof-

’Well, and infisted on his never introducing her into his family; at the Same .time he told him, that his Society would be too great a Sacrifice; and requested him, to be frequent and Sociable in his vifits.—I shall tell my daughters, Said Mr. Cleveland, you are a married man, and are parted from your wife, it will prevent their falling in love with Such a handSome young fellow.
“ TheSe were your father’s words.—► Tou arc the best judge, whether he was Sufficiently guarded.”
My blushes, Fanny, made him the reply he expedled.—You are not ignorant, Said I, of my unfortunate, and what I believed, my criminal attachment to your friend; nay, it was So—for though he was not married, I regarded him, as one, who had vowed fidelity to another. —-It was not until after I was married
that
[ 97 I
tliat I was undeceived—it was then too late.—Yet I have the SatisSadion to rested, that I was as valuable a wife to Mr. Arlington, as iS I had loved him : —by his condud towards me, and his conversation with my father, I have no reaSon to SuppoSe he SuSpeded my regard for your friend.
“ It was impossible he should,” replied Grenville, “ and in that one instance, dissimulation was laudable : his being informed of it, might have made a viSible alteration in his behaviour to you ; it might have occaSioned you to have been very miserable, but never could have inSured your happineSsi Be Satisfied, my dear Mrs. Arlington, with your amiable and justly approved condud to a worthy man, whom your family and Some of your friends knew you could not love.

New Bond-street. MR. Cleveland, and Delmont, called on me yesterday to condudl me to my beloved Lucy.—He Said, he had informed her of his intention to bring me to dinner.—When we came in the houfe, he defired we would go into the dining-parlour, “ There is a cloSet,” faid he, “adjoining, which will conceal you both extremely well: you can there hear every thing that pastes, and it will be a very effedlual and innocent mode of acquainting you of the sttuation of
Lucy’$
[ ri2 ]'
Lucy’s heart; you may fasten the door on the inSide, and if I assert any thing but fafis', you may come out and con--fute me.”
Excellent old man!’ 1 could’ have hugged him Sor the contrivance ; and as I could not be too often affured^of that affedion my dear girl feels for me, I fuffered Cleveland to remain ignorant of my having Seen that letter * which you kindly Sent me, or the conversation between you and.Ducy, which you had communicated. I therefore thanked him by a look,Aor I could not Speak my feelings: I was So overcome with joy, at being, in the Same houSe, and the proSped of fpending the whole day, with the beloved of my heart.
But I-ventured to objed to Delmont being with me, though. Said I, I have
f Letter LVI,-
no
i 113 ]
sto concealments from him ; I think there is an indelicacy at any perSon but her father, being preSent at the interview. Delmorit was of the fame opinion ; he went into the library, and I retired to my hiding-place. Mr. Cleveland then fent for Lucy, and as Soon as she came, addressed her, as near as I can remember, in the following words.
I
“ I promifed to invite Mr. Bofwell, (the only name, thanks to her father^ and your compliance with my request, that she yet knows me by) to dine with, us; but I have met with an acquaintance of Mr. Delm.ont’s, whoj I find, reSided very near Arlington-grove, and who has Sollicited the favour of an interview with you. His name is Seymour \ he is young, rich, amiable, and standfome ; in one word, he is the man of all others, I could wish to be my Son.”
She-
[	114 ]
She was going to Speak----
“ Do not interrupt me, Lucy,” Said he, “ but listen to me with attention. —You will, perhaps, plead the indelicacy of receiving a propoSal oS marriage, So Soon after the death of Mr. Arlington : but you are too young, and you must excuSeafond father, if I add, too handfome, to remain without a guardian.—I cannot exped to live many years ; perSons at my time of life, are liable to complaints, which carry them off very Suddenly ; and my peace of mind in a great meaSure depends, on Seeing you happily Settled with a man you can love, before I die.—Only let me introduce Mr. Seymour into your company, and if you can point out one objection to him, I will never mention his irame to you again.”
I leave
[ ]
I leave you to judge, what a perturbation I was in, during this Speech of Cleveland’s ; and what difficulty I had to remain concealed, when I heard by her voice, the dear girl was in tears.
“ O, my father!” Said she, “for what am I destined.? why is my inclinations to be ever at varience with yours ? why did you flatter me with a proSped of happinefs, which you never intended I should poffeSs, or Suffer me to hope I might yet enjoy the Sweets of life ?—but I now find—hope is too Spacious—too deluSive—and feel the fatal conSequences of giving the traitorefs too friendly a reception.
“ Ah, Sir! is it possible you Can de-Sire me to receive the addrelSes of Mr. Seymour, or any man, except Mr. Bof-well; when I have So candidly avowed, to you—to my Sister—to Mr, Grenville,
that
[ ii6 ]
' that my affedtions are already, and urn alterably fixed, on that BofwelI the most amiable of men !
“ Was not this very man once favoured with your preference ? did you not tell me last week, that you thought that the happiest moment of your life, ■when he Sollicited an interview with me, to avow that fond regard, which has been So long reciprocal! and can you, who have Such a heart, wish me to be again Sacrificed ? imposhbl'e !’
“ I have felt very Severely, by marrying a man I could not love. Though ' he was So very worthy, I had not a con*-Solation during the two years I was his wife, but that of having obeyed the dictates your inclination.—It was likewise from a principle of virtue, but it was a piece of heroiSm I was unequal to..
y I have
[ II7 ]
“ I have now but one thing farther to obServe.—IS you are Suddenly prejudiced against Mr. BoSwell, I will promise never to See him intentionally: but with this proviso, that I may never be introduced into the company of any man, but yourfelf, and Mr. Grenville.’*
She was So extremely affedled, with this new and unexpedted addition to her many trials, that she requested permiS-Sion to retire.
No, my dearest Lucy,” Said her father, “ 1 cannot Suffer you to leave me, until I have convinced you, that you have refufed a man, no ways differing from Mr. BoSwell—but in name.'^
“ Indeed,” she replied, “ that is imS possible—my heart tells me, I shall never know his equal.’*
f!Yes,’;
[ ii8 }
** Yes,” Said her Sather, you will in Seymour meet with all your wishes.”
-----Behold that very Seymour, Said I,
bursting Srom the cloSet, and catching her in my Sond arms, behold the BoS-well you have honoured with your preference, unalterably yours—and changed in nothing, but his name and fortune.
Grenville 1 I cannot possibly convey to you any julf idea, of the astonishment and joy, that were painted on her lovely intelligent countenance :—but when she had in Some meaSure recovered her Surprise, she reproached her father, though in a very Submissive manner, for the deceit he had pradfiSed on her: but recovering her Spirits, and looking archly at me, “ indeed,” Said she, “ you Seem all of you to be Such adepts in deception, I know not what I may venture to believe ?”
“ You
[	‘^9 ]
‘‘ You may believe me,” Said her father, joining our hands, “ when I de-» dare, I thought this young man too amiable to be kept in a state of SuSpence. You have both been Sufferers, by a Series of disappointments; and I think it time you should obtain the reward of your virtues and conftancy. Believe me, my children—for,” Said he, turning, to me, “ 1 confider you already as my Son; had either of you Suffered your mutual affedion to have gained the aScendency over your better judgment, and been So far overcome by your paffions, as to have entered into an illicit attachment, —I do not believe, that Providence would have given you this opportunity of being leg-ally united. For I look on this union, which I hope very Soon to fee accomplished, as a reward for yoiff forbearance from vice—and your strid perfeverance in the paths of virtue.
“ Thefc
[ 120 ]
TheSe are my Sentiments, but I shall not prolong my diScourSe, as long Sermons, generally tire, and by wearying the mind, often loSe their effed.’*
He then left us, and I explained every particular of, and for, my con-dud, to my amiable Lucy.—She treated me with that confidence which I will endeavour to prove worthy of; and she confessed, before 1 left her—“ It was the hafpieji day she had ever known.”
The worthy Delmont shares my felicity, and I have the happineSs to rested, that I shall be enabled to return all my obligations to him, by presenting him with MiSs Cleveland.—Could I but perSuade the two Sisters to go to the altar on the fame day, it might be a means of accelerating my union with my dear girl, who would avoid retarding
her
[ I2I 1
her Sister’s felicity.*-— I hear Mrs. Dormer is expected in town ; tell her not to come; and should Lucy preSs for her company, tell her to refufe Seeing -her, until she,is Mrs. Seymour.—O! that my Lucy was entitled to that name!— Delmont is in the Same houSe with Maria, while I am only received as a vifi-tor.—If I had not Smarted for my deceptions, I would feign Sick, and have Lucy to nurSe me: (for Cleveland would be too humane to fend me out of the houSe) but I believe it is best as it is: nurSes are often left alone with one, and I ,might throw off my Sick mash and be imprudent.
Adieu ! I cannot Spare time to add more, for I must attend my Lucy, it is already noon, and at One o’clock I promised to accompany her to Christie’s, to view a very fine colledlion of pidures , prevdaus to the Sale. I propofed it,

MRS. ARLINGTON T o
MRS. DORMER.
St. James’s-ftreet, Wednefday.
I FIND by your last letter, that Grenville makes you acquainted with the contents oS all the letters he receives from his friend.—I shall inform BoSweil, I mean Seymour, of his treachery; as by this means, you are acquainted with all my tranSaistions; it will be So far of advantage to me, as to Save me the trouble of communicating them.
I do not wonder you are angry at my - writing So Seldom ; for you, who shared my ashidtions, ought to participate my G 2	joys;
[	124	]
joysbut my heart has been So long accustomed to Sorrow, and my pen to exhibit distreSs, that it knows not how to expreSs (the tranSition being So Sudden) the chearful state of its mistreSs’s mind.—To Say in one word, I haf-will anSwer my purpoSe ; as it will be a means of making you So likewise : but it will not complete my wishes; you 'wuft come next Luefday^ and receive ocular demonstration of the Surprifing change in your Lucy.
Do you not recolledl: the voice, which I mentioned to you I heard v/hen I was in the Summer-houSe with my brother eledt ?—the mystery has been explained to me. There is a narrow green lane, which is on one fide the field, and nearly clofe to that fummer-houSe; there the fiy Henry concealed himSelf: but when he Saw me put the flute to my mouth, he imagined, (you will perceive
the
[	125	]
the vanity oS the man) it was to touch that part, which his lips had So oSten pressed; it was then he exclaimed, “It is too much !”—It was, indeed, Fanny, too much for him to gueSs at So great ^ truth. I well remember how much I was alarmed at the SenSations I felt, on having any thing belonging to him in my possession ; and though I wished I had never Seen it, yet I had Scarce resolution to part with it.
You who knew my attachment to BoSwell, at the very time I married Mr. Arlington, have often expressed your astonishment at my appearing So eaSy, and latterly, So happy in my Situation, and have often declared I never loved BoSwell with that ardour which I imagined, or I could not So Soon have obliterated my regard. I did not chuSe then to undeceive you, (for I wished, if possible, to deceive mySelf;) but 1 was G 3	neither
I 126 ]
neither poffeffed of that uncommon vir-- tue or stoiciSm which you SuppoSed.—I never ceaSed'to love BoSwell:—every attention which was lavished on me, was diSpleafing; and every Species of fondr nefs was diSgusting : not in themSelves, bpt coming from a man, who, though uncommonly amiable, I could not love.
None but mySelf know the confiidls I endured; and the only merit which I arrogate to mySelf as being praiSe worthy, was making as good a wife to Mr. Arlington—as if I had loved him. He was quite as well Satisfied, which is a proof, that provided there is not an averfion, love is not So essentially neceS-Sary. Honour, virtue, and a conformity of temper and inclination, are the chief requisites in the conjugal state.— The woman who possesses theSe, may make her hushand happy; but I am still
E 127 I
of opinion love is absolutely necessary to make her So. •
Once more to mention the Stmimer-houSe : you See I was not to be deceived in that voice, whoSe Sounds had So often penetrated my heart.
I must fee you on TueSday—remem*^ ber, I will not be put off longer: but the Surest method I fancy to get you to town, will be, not to write any more to you, and to prohibit any intelligence of me, and mine, tranSpiring at Henley : perhaps, curiofity will compel you to come to

GRENVILLE! I am the happiest of men 1 my Lucy, my incomparable Lucy I has not only promiSed to be mine — but has conSented that next Tuesday shall complete my felicity.
My bofom’s lord fits lightly on his throne,
And all this day, an unaccuftom’d fpirit
Lifts me above the ground with chearful thoughts.
Ah me ! how fweet is love itfelf poflest.

Her father has been my friend in fixing Such an early day ; but it is agreed for her to remain with him a few months longer ; for, as Mr. Arlington has not been dead quite a twelvemonth,, we do not think it confistent with the' opinion of the world, to declare our marriage, until fome time after that period; is expired.	i
I yesterday pr'eSented my dear girl with my piihire; and when I called there this morning, I was at first a good deal chagrined, not to See it on her lovely arm—my eyes reproached her, she understood their language, and with a look of infinite tenderneSs, took it out of her boSom, (where it hung pen-, dant from a black ribbon) obServing, at the fame moment to her father, that “ if the artist had intended to flatter me he had not Succeeded.”

Tour flattery,” Said her father, “ is more likely to make him vain than the /)^z;z/^rV,and you Seem to inSinuate, that the pidure is not So handSome as the original.”—“ That,” Said she, “is certainly my opinion; but when I affure him that beauty is of little estimation with me, I shall not be accessary to his vanity.”	'
It may appear odd my repeating a conversation, in which my perfon was the only Subjed; but it is gratulating, I confeSs, to my feelings, for even that to be thought well of by the woman of my heart.

YOU must know my inclinations are with you, but Mrs. Newman’s little boy has caught the fmall-pox, and as Mr. Newman has never had it. She dare not venture to attend on thedear child. Itis not reasonable to expedt that a fond parent, will trust him to the intire care of a Servant, and it is inconfistent with my feelings, nay to humanity itSelf, to leave them from whom I have received Such friendly attentions, at fuch a jundture. A few days will most probably produce Some change in the diforder, and our
Separation
[	133	]
Separation Sor about a week after you commanded my preSence, cannot be So distressing now you can have Seymour to comfort you.
I had a vifit yesterday from my father in his way from Bath; he ashed me, whether you viSited lady Selby; he has purchased two very elegant brilliant lockets, one he requested my acceptance of, the other he wished to be conveyed to my “ favouriteLucy,” “ As you both wear handkerchiefs,” Said he, “ they may be uSeful to fasten them(you See men are not destitute of observation) but he objedled to the hazard of a 'public conveyance.
I left off rather abruptly, but I was called down to the last perSon I should have expedfed to have Seen,—Captain Hallifax I

Hallifax!—he has been Some time at OxSord, and called here to See me., i(i his way to town ;—but whatever share of vanity I may poffeSs, I do not believe I was the magnet that attrafted him ; no^ Lucy, he certainly wished, and by his conversation expefted to See you here. —The worthy Grenville prcpoSed my giving him the locket to convey to you, it lay on the table diredled Sor you, and he no Sooner made the propoSal, than Hallifax put it in his pocket, Saying, “ he should. Send it you by MrSi Hallifax, for he would not Subje£thim>» Self a fecond time to yom incivitityP’-— Grenville aSked for an explanation of his words, which he did not obtain ; but your account of the gentleman’s behaviour to you, made me perfedtly. understand what he alluded to.
I have already been too long abSent from the nurSery,—and must bid you
adieu,
[ 135 J
adieu, when I have affured you, that you was perfedUy right, when you guessed that I had Seen all Seymour’s letters to his friend.—Excellent young man !—how I should envy any perSon but yourSelf* the proSpeCl of Such an alliance!—But every one allows my Lucy to be entitled to {omtiKino fuper-excellevJ.
Heigh ho —^I wish your Caro Enrh CO, would Summons Grenville to town, —otherwise I must in my own defence quit the country ;—no wonder when he is in your opinion So very amiable, and when there are Such touchwood materials in the heart of your

A letter which I have Seen, Since 1 wrote this, acquaints me that next TueS-
day
[	136 ]
day is the day appointed for your marriage.—I do not think even that joyous occafion,Tan justify my leaving this hoS-pitable family in their prefent fituation, but I charge you not to delay your Ipng wished-for union, with your amiable Seymour, becaufe I shall not be prefent. »—As Soon as the child is better you may be affured of my company, and I shall depend upon congratulating you on having accepted the name of Seymour.

BE adviSed—do not inSped the next letter which Grenville receives from the amiable Seymour! For should your cu-riofity induce you to gratiSy the impulSe So natural to your Sex, remember you* will repent it.
I SoUicited your company next Tucf* day (which will be to-morrow) and you are acquainted with my motive; what-^ ever you may SuppoSe, be affured, I am not angry at your declining it, when! 1 consider the propriety of your motives,.
I can

I can only Say I am Sorry for the occasion, but notwithstanding the importunities of my Gentleman or my Fanny’s intreaties, I will in this one instance be obstinate, and perfist in not yielding my willing hand until you can be preSen;. at the ceremony.
I affure you, Seymour has thought proper to give himSelf many airs on the occaSion, he Says, “ you have not aS-figned the true reaSon for not coming, that you would not decline being present on Such an occaSion, to Save the whole raceoSNewmans from the grave,” and throws out Such Scandalous aSper-fions^ that I will not Suffer my pen to particularize ;■ So much for him. But remember I commend your condud, and one motive for not telling you why I fixed on TueSday, in preference to Seeing you on any other day, was, that you might ad right, and not have your
judgment
I 139 ]
judgment warped, by the determination you would then have made of not delaying my happineSs;—but I am not in Such a violent hurry, to know he will be mine is quite Sufficient to inSure my feligity. I am interrupted.-—— '
By whom do you think ? but the elegant lady Selby, and the pretty inSenfi^ ble Mrs. Hallifax, she is very intimate with Delia, and has been with her ever Since she was married. So that I find they were the new married pair, which the Captair^ Said she was going to. How they became acquainted I do not know, nor had I the curiofity to enquire.
In the courSe of conversation, I mentioned my concern to Mrs. Hallifax, at being deprived of her company when her hushand was with us at the grove. —“ My hushand with you !” she exclaimed,—then turning to lady Selby,
‘‘ Why
I
f 140 J
« Why, my dear, you know he told u» he was at OxfordP She then heaved a deep Sigh—-and I Saw the starting tear. Poor little woman! I could not help pitying her, how unkind must be his treatment to her, when it So greatly af-feds one, who Seems to poffeSs So Smalt a share of Senfibility.
I begin to think I have been most highly and undeServedly favoured by Providence,, to have been the child of Such a parent! to have been So reSped-fully, and kindly treated by a man I could not love !^—and (“ though last not least”) to be beloved by Such as Seymour is, juStly entitle me to be called fortunate.
Mrs, Hallifax forgot the Locket, but fays, she and Delia shall be in Kenfing-ton Gardens, where the beau monde aS-Semble round the baSon, to morrowand

every fine morning, and she will take care to have it in her pocket.—She pressed me to meet them to-morrow, with an unaccountable earnestneSs, and as all the good company assemble there, and I am Sond oS 'walking, I purpoSe going.'
As I know the Cblonel to be a man of taste, I have no doubt but I shall be much pleaSed with his genteel preSent, and am impatient to have it from Mrs.
Hallifax.----You Said, your father
called of you in his way from Bath,”— I judged, he was coming to town, and thought it extraordinary he should not be the bearer of his prefent, but Delia informed me, that he went from you immediately, to make a short stay with a friend at Windfor, which accounts for his not pleasuring me with a vifit.
My

My father and Sister defire to be kindly remembered by you, they are both, thank God, in perfed health, and my Sister’s Spirits are So elated, that my fa« ther teazes her from morning until night, telling her, “ her former gravity proceeded from the apprehenfion of being an old maid;” what elates mine “ why” Says my Fanny, “ the near approach of being united to the man of your heart,”------You guefs right.
Remember me to Grenville, if your poor combustible heart, will Suffer you to approach him. I am not in the least alarmed at your feeling a 'preference for him., I know you cannot love your huf-band, and provided you conceal your gard from the man of your choice, as you do not Spend your days with that hushand, I no not think it material to him^ whether you love him or not; our inclinations are not in our power, but
our

our cond.ufi is; and as I think it is ia your nature to like the Society of Some male creature, I would encourage you to admire Grenville for theSe reaSons ; i	namely,—If he should perceive the par-

THE perturbation of my heart, has So bereft me of all compoSure of mind, s	and my Senfes are So bewildered, that it
is impossible to expreSs mySelf as uSual; but as repofing our griefs in a faithful boSom, often alleviates them, I will without farther preface, endeavour to give you an exadl journal of my proceedings Since I received the anonymous letter.
It came too late for me to Send to Delmont that night, but I went early
next
[	149 ]
next morning to Mr. Cleveland’s, where I Sound the lovely Lucy (Sor So indeed she appeared in Spite of every prejudice) and her Sister, dressed and preparing Sor a walk.
“The fineness of the morning,” they Said, “ made them prefer the exerciSe to going in the carriage.” Just at that instant Mrs. Dormer arrived, I could perceive very unexpectedly ;—O, Said Lucy, how happy am I to See you !—and this will give me an opportunity of Sending an excuSe to lady Selby and Mrs.' Hallifax, with whom I had a Sort of an appointment in Kenfington Gardens,, you have come very opportunely to free me from Spending So diSagreeable a morning.
Mrs. Dormer urged her to go, and observed she could accompany her;— but Lucy immediately objected, and H 3	Said,.
I 150	]
Said, she had rather defer it until ano-
/ ther opportunity.----------What could be
her reaSons ? The conversation then became general, and Lucy was remarkably gay ;—you know I am a poor dissembler, and I could not for the Soul of me, be in Spirits, which made their chearfulneSs at that time particularly diSgusting: I had my hand in my pocket Several times with the intent to produce the anonymous letter, (which I incloSed to you for your peruSal, or ra* ther the copy of it) to shew to all the parties preSent ;—but prudence Suggested to me, that would not be a means , of coming at the truth, for the intelligence you perceive was not quite falSe, reSpedting the meeting in KenSington Gardens; as I found her going, and though she mentioned that her appointment was with two ladies, it was not likely she should Say otherwife in my presence.—^Thus, Grenville, was I kept,
in
[ ISI ]
in this torturing state oSSuSpence,amidst the transports and congratulations o£ two of the Sincerest and most affedio-nate friends, the Sex ever produced.

I was two much agitated to wish to continue there, though Lucy gave me the most pressing invitation to stay dinner. “ Her father,*’ she Said, “ would return out of the city, and when she informed him of my refufing any request of hePSy she was certain, he would be much Surprised.”-—She Spoke this with fo much tenderneSs, yet So emphatically, that I felt most fenfibly the poignancy of her remark ; and to preferve appearances, 1 pleaded indiSpofition from an irregularity pf the night before.
I immediately withdrew, as I was: afraid my countenance would betray the real state of niy disorder.

When I leSt the room, Lucy attempted to call me back, but her tears prevented her articulating distindly, and I quitted the houSe, pretending ignorance of her endeavours to recall me. Alas ! what a wretcli I at that time felt myfelf ? for in Spite of that indignation which herfuppofed infidelity had given f ife to in my mind, her enchanting form^ her SweetneSs of difpofition, came every instant prefent to my imagination, to counterad every resolution I had made, to quit her, should I not be able to obtain prooSs of her innocence. ?—but to proceed.—On leaving Cleveland’s, I immediately ordered my chariot to Ken-fington Gardens, and went in at the door neJft the Palace Gate' (which you know leads nearest the baSon.)
After walking about half an hour, and meeting a few people, (to whom I

Seated cloSe to me, who must have been there Some time ; for very politely bowing to me,, he Said, “ he feared I was Suddenly indiS-poSed, having continued in a most melancholy posture for a long time.”
This roufed me from my lethargy' and a deep involuntary figh'eScaped me,, and I could only thank him for his kind attention to a stranger : but recolledling; the Situation,—Seeing him look frequently at his watch, and wear an impatient countenance; itthen occurred to me, that this was probably the very perfon alii 5	ludedi

W E was at the appointed place, pundtually at Seven this morning. We perceived a gentleman waiting, who immediately came up to us, and enquired “ if my name was Seymour On my replying in the affirmative, he gave me a note, the contents of which was to inform me, that “ an affair of the greatest importance, prevented his keeping the appointment, but that I might depend on hearing farther froin him.”—The note was not Signed, and on my enquiring mho Sent it the person

I have learned from Delmont, that after I left Cleveland’s, Lucy complained of being indiSpoSed, and as Soon as dinner was over,; retired to her own room, Mrs. Dormer accompanying her: —while they were at dinner, Cleveland ashed Lucy, if she had taken her intended walk to KenSington.—She Said, she had not, as the unexpedied arrival of Fanny, had induced her to decline going. “ Then you chooje to avail yourSelf of that excuSe,” Said he, ‘tether-

To this she made no reply, nor did she mention my having been there,-— this Serves to make her more deSpicable in my opinion; Sor why should she conceal my having vifited her, unleSs to prejudice me in her father’s opinion ?-« but her advocate, Delmont, thinks her behaviour a proof that the whole is a calumny ;—(would f eould think So too !) and her motive for not mentioning my having been there, was to prevent her father being diSpleaSed at my refufing to stay dinner, when she requested in

CHARLES GRENVILLE, ESQ.
New Bond.ftreet.
I WENT, as I intended, last night to Cleveland’s, and passing along the Hall, I Saw him writing in the little parlour; he looked up on hearing Somebody paSs, but though he Saw it was me, he kept a profound Silence, and never offered to quit the room to meet me.
When I went in the drawing-room, I found Delmont and MiSs Cleveland Seated together on a Sopha, looking y unutterable things — Fanny was
pouring
I 168 ]
pouring out the tea ; Lucy (who was Seated as cloSe to her as possible) was leaning on the table, with her head re-. dined on her hand.
I opened the door with So much caution, that they did not immediately See me, which gave me the opportunity of observing their fituations which I have described, and heard Fanny exclaim,
1 wish every tear you shed was a drop of blood from his heart.”—The door making a noifc as I attempted to shut it, made them all look up-; and Lucy, in hastening to meet me, entangled her foot in her gown, and fell.
The fight of her lovely face, moist with her tears ; the joy which she Seemed to feel, and which shone in her lovely eyes at my approach; added to my apprehenfions, lest she should have received any shurt from the aukward
manner
[169]
manner in which she Sell,—“chaSed from my mind at that moment, every idea of her iiifidelity. Railing her from the ground, and Seating mySelf cloSe by her, I detained her lovely hand, and was So intoxicated by her charms, that I believe, I should have gazed until now without attempting to Speak, had not she, with the most tender anxiety, enquired after my health.—“ DelmontV time,’* Said she, “ js So taken up with his Dulcinea, (pointing to her Sister) that I stave not been able to learn from stim, whether you were perfedly recovered.”
I expressed my SurpriSe at Mr. Cleveland’s abfence, obServing, that I Saw him when I passed the little parlour.-— Lucy Said, “she knew he was bufy writing letters to India, as a ship was expedled to Sail every day ; but,’* continued she, “ if you will trust yourSeif VoL. II.	I	with
[ lyo ]
with me, we will uSe our influence with him to come up.”
As Soon as I had her on the outSide of the door, I thanked her for the opportunity she had given me, of a tete-a-tete ; but we will defer fetching your father, and now I must inSist you trust yourSelf with me in your dressing-room, as I have Something to communicate which is essential for you to know.
‘‘ No, no,” Said she, “ we had better go to my father, and then return to the drawing-room, for 1 expedl: Lady Selby to See Fanny, and if we are missing, she will be fidl of her rallery all the even-ing.”—Then, Said I, let the Servants Say you are fro.m home ; if she comes to See her JiJler, she cannot be offended ztyour absence : you have Said on many occasions, my requests were commands.
“ And
[	171	]
“ And So you shall find them,^* Said she, leading me into her room ; “ I had. rather forSeit the good opinion of the whole worldwere I poffeffed of it, than Suffe'rjyi?« to think me changed.”
Ah, Lucy, Said I, is this true? did you never tell any other man the Same story ? or Speak to any other with the Same tender language with which your eyes now converSe ?—did you not feel yourSelf disappointed at my ill-timed viSit, which prevented you going to KenSington Gardens ?
During all theSe interrogations, I kept my eyes stedfastly fixed on her countenance, which to do her justice,; betrayed no more confuSion than was natural to So modest a woman, at being So ardently gazed on.
I 2	RiSing
[ 172 ]
Hi Sing precipitately from my knee on which I had placed her, and bursting into a stood of tears, “ Cruel Seymour !’* Said she, “ what part of my condudt justifies your fufpieions ? Have not you been informed by your friend Grenville, (of whole veraeity you cannot have a doubt) of my attachment to at a time when it was even criminal to indulge it ?—I did not., indeed, indulge it, during the time I	another*s
wife. I struggled with my ill-fated passion, and the constidt between love and duty, nearly overpowered my rea-fon, it greatly injured my constitution, and I begin now to think, it would have been happier to have fallen a Sacrifice to my feelings, than to have lived the objed of your unjust and groundleSs jealouSy.”
I attempted to replace her on my knee, but she declined it, with a coun-I	tenance
I 173 I
tenance expressive of anger and vexation, without deigning to Speak fb me. —O, Said I, my beloved girl ! ceaSe Such: cutting, though Silent reproaches, until you have Seen this letter, (shewing her the anonymous one I had received) and then tell me if 1 am So very blame-able, or if 1 have not cauSe for thoSe Suspicions which torment me ?—bur, observe, before you read it, that I now firmly believe it the prodmSfion of Some Secret enemy ; it was madneSs to douht your fidelity^ and I shall never be at eale until I can call you mine..
When she had read the letter, “ Many,” Said she, “ after receiving this, would have abandoned me for ever, without condescending to request an explanation; but I now in fist on your acquainting me with all the circumstantial proofs you have received of' your Lucy’s infidelity.”
I 3;	I them
[	174 ]
1 then related th^ interview with the gentleman in KenSington Gardens, and every particular which I gave you. an account of in my last letter :—but when I came to that part of my narrative, where Delmont accompanied me as my Second, the dear girl turned pale, and exclaimed, “ Good God ! was my Seymour in Such imminent danger ?”—no, my love, Said I, I was not in any ; for the gentleman, I tell you, instead of keeping the appointment. Sent an ex-cuSe: “ well but,” Says she, “ if you should hear farther from him, will you promife me not to go ?”
I am Sore, Said I, I would do any thing to make you happy ; but in this affair myhonourh concerned.—“True,” she replied, “ but I think, I could contrive to freferve your honour^ without hazarding your liJeV-—How, my Sweet ' / tender girl?—“ Why, by having you
remain
[ >75 3
remain here, and letting it be reporteci, you are out oS town ; then, should arry appointment be made, by not receiving the message, you will remain ignorant oS it. But deScribe the perSon of your unknown rival ; fori think, I may be certain, it was not a man; and from ■many circumstances have my SuSpicions •—that it was Some malicious perSon in
diSguiSe:----SuppoSe MiSs Collins ?—>
may shelnot envy me my approaching felicity ?	'
I then told her, the perSon whom I SuppoSed a gentleman, was rather tali', handSome, but too Small features for a maSculine countenance; very reraarka> ble arched eye-brows, that were So narrow they had the appearance of being penciled, and a large dimple in the chin.
I 4	Good
' [	176	]
Good heaven ! is it possible,*’ Said she, “thatshe can have So bad a heart?’*
On my ashing her who she alluded to “ Lady Selby,” Said she, “ the daughter oS Colonel Morley, exaftly - anSvver-^ this description; shut I told you, she is expeded here this evening, and her presence will unravel this mystery,
“ But I must now explain the nature of my engagement to Kenfington for it is not Sufficient that 1 know my own innocence; I must have Suspicions done away, before I will become your wifeV
I was going to Speak--—“ Do not interrupt me,” Said she, “ but listen to me with attentioix
“ Colonel Morley had purchaSed two brilliant lockets, one for Fanny—the
other
[ 177 ]'
Other intended as a preSent to me. Cap^ tain Hallifax, who happened to call at Henley while your Sriend and mine were at Mr. Newman’s, the Sormer requestedl him to convey it to me, as he was coming immediately to London. But as‘ my behaviour, or to uSc a more proper expression, my r<?y’«y^jj diad So much of-Sended him, he Said ‘ he should not' Subjedt himSelS a Second time to my in-Sults, but should Send it by Mrs. Hallh-Sax.’'
“ A few days after she came, accompanied by Lady Selby ; who I found,, was an intimate acquaintance of her’s,. and at whoSe houSe she had been ever Since Delia married.—I impatiently enquired for my locket, (for to confeSs a-truth, I deSignedit as a prefent to you) but she Said, she had forgot to bring: it ; but if I would meet her the next morning, or the first fine-one, near the I5	X BaSon
[ 178 i
BaSon inKenSington Gardens, she would have it in her pocket.
‘ “ I very precipitately promiSed ta meet them ; but aSter they were gone, it occured to me, that it was possible Captain Hallifax might be with them, whom I did not wish to See; you are . not ignorant oS my reaSons, for in that, and every other circumstance, I have never had a concealment from you Since I gave you the promiSe of my hand. I consulted with my father in what manner I should ad, and he adviSed me to go.
“ This opinion of his determined me, and you found my Sister and I equiped for pur walk ;—but the unexpeded arrival of my dear Fanny, made me alter my resolution of going : for recolleding Mr. Dormer was jealous of lIatlifax., when the latter was in India, I would
not^
[ 179 J
not designedly Subjeft her to the pro-" bability of an interview.
“ You are now acquainted with the particulars of my intended excurfion to KenSington; and though it may not; have been ‘ As you like it;’ you will, allow there has been ‘ Much ado about, nothing.”
A loud rap at the door made her start' from her feat, “ There is Lady Selby,” Said she, “T know her Servant’s rap— go to my father, and explain matters as clearly in. your justification to him you have done to me. He is at preSent adittle diSpleaSed with you, for having been leSs frequent in your vifits ; par--ticularly, for not giving us your company to dinner the day I requested it.
“ I did not intend him to know that you had been , invited ; . but Fanny was: 16	So
[ i8o 3
So piqued at your behaviour, that she betrayed you beSore I could give her a caution. But my father is too confi-derate, and too fond of you, to remain long angry upon proper explanations : I will go into the drawingroom and let it appear to Lady Selby, you arc but just come ; none of the perSons we left in the room, will betray our long, tete-a-tete.’'
I pressed the dear, fond, faithful girl! to my boSom, (for Such, Grenville, I may Surely pronounce her) and then permitted her to return to the company ; while I went to her father with a much greater share of Spirits, than when I passed the little parlour.
He received me with a reServe that stabbed my very Soul, yet it was no more, than I was conScious I deServed from the appearances that were against
me.
[ i8i ]
me. But I very Soon obtained a patient and attentive hearing, and had the inexpressible Sarisfadion to hear him acknowledge,-1 had adled with more prudence and moderation, than many young men would, who had believed them-Selves fo highly injured.
“ I have na reaSoh to SuppoSe,” Said he, “ Srom any part of Lucy’s condudl,^ that Sne has any concealments from me:,
I knew, and I find you are not a stranger to the many opportunities Hallifax has fought, of Sapping the foundation of her virtue. But frequent repuiSes, and her juft indignation, made him give over his purfuit; and I will venture to Say, she has neither heard from him, or any other man (yourfelf excepted) Since her return to town,
“ But I shall not attempt to justify her condud, it is an inSult to a woman^
of
r 183 ]
oS her principles and unimpeached cha-fader; and this SalSe and diabolical stigma which has been cast on her’s, is a proof, that ‘ virtue itSelf eScapes not calumnious strokes.*
“ I tliink Lucy’s Suspicions of Lady Selby, carry abfurdity on the face of them: for how is it possible, she could even in that diSguiSe efcape the notice of her own family ?-—Though she has not, I believe, much delicacy in her composition, she cannot be So totally lost to a SenSe ot shame, for to appear in-men’s apparel at nooh-day, in Such a public Spot, as Kenfington Gardens; and to what purpofe, my good friend I —Can she be interested in the wish to create a distention between you and Lucy ?
“ I do not wonder at her Suppofing the perSon to be MiSs Collins; (except
the
[	i83	]'
the improbality of any diSguiSe concealing her from your knowledge)—but I would adviSe you to return to the drawing-room, and Seek for the reSemblance Lucy has discovered between your unknown rival, and Lady Selby.”
He then introduced me to the Ladies, and Lucy alked me if 1 had drank tea; (that it might appear to Lady Selby,
I SuppoSe, that I was that moment come.) The first glance of her face, confirmed me, it was the Same perSon whom I had the interview with in Ken-Sington Gardens; and the idea of having challenged a woman, was So truly laughable, that I had Some difficulty to SuppreSs my rifibility.
This confirmation of Lucy’s Suspicions, though it effedually justified this amiable girl, filled my mind with the , greatest astonishment, as I could not fathom
r 184 ]■
thorn the motive for Lady Selby’s condudt. I think there is not a doubt of the anonymous letter being the pro-dudion of her brain, which you will allow, does more credit to her head than her heart:,.
I; Saw by her confufion, that she re-Golleded me the moment I entered the room many in my Situation would; have felt apleaSure in betraying her adventure in the preSence of the whole company,: and, I confeSs, when I considered the unhappineSs she had occafii o.ned to Lucy and mySelf, I was half induced to Seek revenge : but a kind of veneration: I have always felt for her Sex—the lovelineSs of her per Son—in short, the powerwhich beauty ever had over the heart of your friend, pleaded fo.Drongly in her behalf, that 1 could not fubjed her to thevonfuSion, which
men-
[ ]
mentioning the circumstance in her presence, must have occasioned.
As Cleveland had returned to his writing, 1 took an opportunity to flip put of the room, and communicate to him the confirmation of Lucy’s Suspicions, which I received on the first glance of Lady Selby’s face.
“ I do not wonder,” Said he, at he» confuSion, on meeting with you So very unexpededly: she, without doubt, imagined the step which she had taken, had
put an end to your vifits to Lucy.---
Though this diScoverymust banishevery fuSpicion of my girl’s infidelity ; yet, I am convinced, she will never conSent ta htyouPSy until this mystery is entirely cleared up, and explained to your Satis-fadion,
” S would
[ 1
“ I would not treat Lady Selby with the Severity she merits^ as I reSpedt her father ; and as Sir William is gone to his estate in Devonshire, I would not ad-vife you to go to his wife, but I will go there mySelf, and extort a full confession of her diabolical proceedings, by threatening her with a public diSeovery.’*
I highly approved, and expressed my-Self very grateful for his kind intentions, and wanted him to return with me to the drawing-room, but he declined it. Saying, he should not be able to conceal his indignation from Lady Selby, which he thought it would be politic to do, as he meant to take her by furprifeP
' When I returned, Lucy told me, the fair adventurer had taken the opportunity of my abSence, to make her eScape.
She ashed us,” Said she, as Soon as
you
[	i87	]
you was gone, if we had not obServed how much she was diSconcerted at your first appearance ?” —before we could reply, “ I am certain,” Said she, “ it was too apparent toeScape notice ; but she So exadUy reSembles an amiable young man, for whom 1 once very foolishly entertained a penchant; that it put my Spirits in Such an agitation, I was ready to faint.”
I fancy, Charles, fome part of this account, was a very true state of her feelings.
Lucy had communicated what she knew of this unaccountable affair, to Delmont, Maria, and Fanny; and as we weie then, entirely free from other company, we naturally gave our Sentiments on this mysterious condudl of Lady Selby’s; but all highly approved of
the
I iS8 ]
the method Mr. Cleveland intended to purSue,
Lucy rang the bell, and ordered the Servant to inform her father that Lady Selby was gone, and that we entreated the favour of his company.
The Servant Said “ his master was gone out, that he ordered a coach a few minutes after I had returned to the 4rawing>roomd*
We concluded he followed Lady Selby.—Her recent conduct occasioned us to moralize on the malignity of the world, which Delmont thinking would produce too much gravity, requested Lucy’s attendance at the har^.jichord; “Agreed,” Said she, “provided Mr. Seymour has his flute with him, (looking jery archly at me), and we shall
form
[	i89	1
form a concert, leaving thoSe that will not play to criticiSe.”
We amuSed ourSelves with the vocal and instrumental, for near three hours; until Lucy expressed herSelf alarmed at her father’s staying So late, and declared she could not play any longer.
We then Set down to Supper, but I could perceive it was mere form in Lucy, as she did not partake of any thing.—I was equally SurpriSed and unhappy as the rest of them ; and had not prudence didated to me, that it vras time for me to retire, I should certainly have waited Cleveland’s return.—I promised to breakfast with them early in the morning, and then quitted my Soul’s treaSure !
I wish, Charles, you would perfuade Mr. Newman to part with you—your

[	19° ]
preSence would at this time, be as g^eat a convenience as a pleaSure ; for I cannot Suffer you to remain ignorant of any thing which concerns me; and writing Such long narratives, ingroffes nearly my whole time which is not Spent with Lucy.

CHARLES GRENVILLE, ESQ^,
New Bond-ftreet.
YOU may now congratulate your happy Seymour on the prolpedts that await him! the amiable! the virtuous Lucy ! is as good as she is lovely, upon the late mysterious affair being cleared up, and explained in a manner to convince me of her innocence, she has acquired a vivacity, which makes her, if possible, still more charming ;—but to
proceed to my narrative:-It is fit I
should releaSc you Srom SuSpence, (that most irkSome of all Situations).
K 2	I went,
[ 196 ]
went, as I promiSed, very early the next morning to Cleveland’s, and Sound him and his amiable guest waiting breakfast. He aroSe, upon my name being announced by the Servant, and taking my hand with a most courteous Smile, led me to his Seat, which was next to Lucy’s.—“ Now,” Says he, “ the circle is complete, but Seymour’s countenance informs me, I shall not Satisfy his impatience, until I acquaint him of the particulars of my last night’s ramble ; I SuppoSe you guessed I was at lady Selby’s, I followed her as Soon as she left my houSe, in hopes of getting there, before she might give orders to be denied, and I Succeeded, I found her in the drawing room, but judge of my furpriSe, when 1 perceived Nancy Collins Seated by her, whom she called Mrs. Hallifax. —I was reSolved, notwithstanding she was preSent, to interrogate lady Selby, who, 1 fancy, guested my errand, her con-'	fuSion
[ 197 3
fuSion was So viSible.”—“ You came very opportunely,” Said she Sneeringly,
“ Sor if you had stayed a few moments later, I should have been denied^ for I feel mySelf very un-well.”—But I disregarded this hint, and told her ladyship the whole deSign of my vifit.
She for Some time evaded, heSitated, ' and denied her knowledge of the affair; until I produced the anonymous letter, and ashed her, whether she would upon oath declare, it was. not her composition ?
Tears of rage (not contrition I am Sure) started from her eyes, “ Yes,” Said she, “ I did write it, and it was I, that went indiSguiSe toKenSington Gardens, and what of all this ? I fancy I am a better charader still than your youngest daughter, what I did, was to Serve Mrs. HalliSax, whoSe hushand, your amiable K 3	Lucy I
[	198	]
Lucy ! has estranged from her affec-ion : T SuppoSe, Mr. Seymour, (continued she, affedling to laugh) will not now think of challenging me, and now I have given you So much fatisfadfion to your impertinent questions, I v/ish you a Safe return to your family, and I do assure you, if it was not for your being an old man I should give the porter orders to shew you the outssde of the door. I shall leave you, but if you are very anxious for more information, Mrs. Hallifax can Satisfy your curi-oSity.”
When she was gone, I addressed Mrs. Hallifax. “ You are, I find. Madam, no stranger to this diabolical bufineSs, neither am I a stranger to you, I think your name was Collins.”—“ I am,” she replied, “ the fame woman, but now married toCaptain Hallifax.”—‘.Dray,” Said I, “ what information am I to ex-
pe(st
[	199 ]
pe£t from you ?—you find yourSelf the perSon lady Selby referred me to."’
She turned pale, and Seemed ready to faint ;—“ come. Madam,” Said I, “ confeSs what you know oS theSe infamous falsehoods, for I am determined otherwise, to expoSe all the SuSpeded parties, to clear my daughter’s honour. You know I am well acquainted with your former connexions, and can readily believe, you have been acceffary to this piece of bufinefs.”
The refolute manner with which 1 Spoke, extorted what I aimed at;—she threw herSelf upon her knees, and declared herSelf the authoreSs and contriver, of the whole affair, and that lady Selby So highly approved the Scheme, that she voluntary offered her assistance to perSonate a gentleman, to be a corroborating proof of Lucy’s infidelity ;
K 4	« for,”
[ 200 ]
“ for,” Said she, “ I could not assume any diSguiSe that would conceal me from the knowledge of Mr. Seymour.—It was a deep laid Scheme, and had it not been Nor lady Selby’s obstinacy, in viSiting at your houSe, it might never have been -discovered ; but be afftired 1 Sincerely repent, and believe me, the reproaches of my own conscience, after the Scheme was put into execution, at the refieftion ' of having rendered a whole family miserable, was a Sufficient punishment for my guilt.” — I am really married to , Capuin Hallifax, but have hitherto concealed from him the true sstuation of myfelf and family. He uSed me very kindly for fome time after my marriage, but he nb Sooner beheld Mrs. Arlington, than all his kindneSs for me vanished, he has in my prefence avowed his regard for your daughter, ever drawn comparisons between us, which you may SuppoSe were to my disadvantage;
my
[ 201 ]
Jny perSon, which was formerly the ob-jedt of admiration, no longer pleaSes, and the kindest epithet I gain, when he is in his heft humours, is, his piece of Jiill lifeV
This condndl: of her hushand’s, instigated her to be revenged, but, as I observed to her, he should have been the objedt of it, and not my innocent Lucy,. or Seymour, to whom she had formerly many obligations..
She So earnestly implored my for-givenefs, and my word of honour not to mention the affair to her hushand, that as she appeared So penitent, and had adted So candidly,, I affured her she might make herSelf eaSy, reSpedling any thing I should Say to her disadvantage, and.that I would likewiSe venture to aS-fure her of the Secrecy of my family, but before I left her, I gave her a sharp K 5	ledlure.
[ 202 1
ledfure, and deSired her to remember, that every Species of revenge, “ though Sweet at first, bitter e’er long, back on itSelS recoils.”
“ And nov7,” Said the good old man, “ 1 hope this intricate affair is unravelled to all your Satisfadlions; I most earnestly pray, you will not meet with any X farther impediments to your happinefs, and may every blessing a fond parent . can bestow, deScend upon my Lucy and her worthy Seymour!”
After giving this tender, generous, man ! every acknowledgement a grateful heart could fuggest, I told Lucy that it only now remained for her to conSent to my assuming a privilege, which I confessed I did not merit, but that I could never know a hapfy hour until I could call her mine,
“ Well
[ 203 J
“ Well, Lucy,” Said her father, “you may gueSs the poor culprit’s wishes, by his preface, do my good girl allow him to name the happy day.”
The lovely girl, with amostinchant-ing Smile, and her face covered with a Sweet effuSion, Said, “ If Seymour’s happineSs depends on me, it is already in his possession, I have loved him toa well to wish to delay \i\s felicity.”
Then next Tuesday, Said I, looking at Mr. Cleveland, will you honour me with the appellation of Son ^—“ most gladly,” Said he, “ for none but (my Lucy could be worthy of you.”
Grenville! this Lucy is an angel!— she is above diSguiSe, and avows her regard for me, in the preSence of her whole family.—How delicate in all her adions, words, and looks!—yet Scorns to be K 6	fettered
[	204	]
fettered with restraint, when she wishes to confer a favour on the man who is Soon to be her hushand, even a few days appear an age until she will be my “ charming found ! that Seems like mu-

My dear friend,
I HOPE this will arrive before Mr. Grenville leaves you, as I am in great want of his friendly assistance, to enquire after his acquaintance Sedgwick. I want to know for certain, whether he is at Oxford or not i*—for Colonel Mor-ley called here very late last night, just returned from WindSor, in conSequence of a report he had heard in a public company, and which many circumstances corroborated with, of lady Selby being eloped with Sedgwick.
Uf
[ 2o6 J
My father went to her houSe, and the Servants Said, their lady went out of town last week, to See a Sick relation at Hartford in Kent, but the carriage and horSes were returned; the postillion Said, they were met by an empty chaiSe and one Servant, a few miles on this fide Hartford, into which lady Selby got, and ordered them home.
Sir William, they Said, was still in Hevonshire, and there were Several letters come from him, which now lay on / her table, as she gave no orders for them to be forwarded to her.
I think there is little doubt of the and I only fear this woman’s imprudent, not to Say criminal condudt, will most Senfibly afflid her father and her hushand, who have always viewed her faults with the most affedionate partiality. The former has intreated
me,
[	207	]
me, to uSe every means to come at the truth, and as I am well assured Mr. Grenville will readily oblige any Sriend of your’s, request him to go himSelf to Oxford, and procure every possible intelligence reSpeding Mr. Sedgwick.
Write as Soon as you have any thing to communicate, relative to this unfortunate affair, to your very Sincere, though perplexed friend,
FANNY DORMER.
Lucy has wrote to you, I find, by the Same conveyance, I defired she would, as I knew it would give you pleaSure, to hear of her approaching felicity ; though there is no doubt but Mr. Grenville has already informed you :—my reSpeds to him and Mr. Newman.

I ARRIVED here very early yesterday morning, having travelled all night, and got here before Seymour had open’d the fringed curtains of his eyes;”—but before 1 mention any thing more of him, let me assure you that I write this letter to you, in preference to Newman, in hopes it may make my peace with you, and Smooth your forehead of thoSe frowns, which my uncivil Speech on my departure from Newman Place, had occasioned.-—

caSioned.—^Not that I deServe Sorgive-neSs, becauSe I do not Sincerely repent, I am not mySelS Senfible of my fault,— and you can expedt little amendment, until 1 feel conviction ; excuSe me, my good friend, but I know I am too honest a fellow to be a favourite with your fex;—a flatterer is a most agreeable charming fellow, but I am too apt to Speak
** Such truths as ^omen Celdom learn from meuf Too roughly fpoke to pleafe a Lady'% ear.
and now I have explained the nature of what you may call my fault, I will proceed to my narrative.
After having rouSed Seymour by my early vifit, we dandled over our breakfast for near two hours, for you may fup-pofe we had much to talk over; we called of Lucy, and went together to
Strat-
I
[ 214 ]
Stratford Place, to See a ready furnished hoLiSe which they had thoughts of hiring for the winter, “ You know,” Said Seymour, “ we are both too fond of the country, not to enjoy it in the Summer months, and it is my intention to build me a townshouSe to my own taste, of which no perSon can have a doubt of my poffeshng, when they contemplate on my dejtined brideV
Happy Seymour ! I exclaithed, and an involuntary figh would efcape me.
After returning from the houSe, (which they have agreed for, and which is fitted up in a very elegant taste) we went to her father’s to dinner, and it was proposed we should Send to take a box, as Garrick (that living comment upon ShakeSpeare !) was to play Richard.
1—All consented, except Mrs. Dormer,
who
[	215	]
who expedled Colonel Morley to call on her in the evening.
I considered there would be an impropriety in my leaving, her, when I was the perSon that was expeded to communicate Some intelligence reSpeding my hopeSul acquaintance Sedgwick.
The Colonel came, as we expeded, and I informed him that I had been to Oxford, and had made every possible enquiry after Sedgwick, that the only account I could obtain. Served to confirm our fears reSpeding the truth of the report, as he had been miffing from thence, about the Same time lady Selby had left London, and had not been heard of by any of his acquaintance Since.

THE too amiable Grenville, I find, has acquainted you with the reSult of his friendly viSit to Oxford, and I have no doubt, but we all accord in the opinion, that every circumstance corroborates, Sedgwick and Delia being eloped together.
Sir William, unfortunate man! was So very unhappy at not hearing from lady Selby, that he travelled post to VoL.II.	L	London,
/
[	2i8	]
London, and finding my father was in town, went to his lodgings. Such an interview ! rnust have been inexpressibly distressing: the still doating, though injured hushand, declared himSelf willing to receive her with open arms, but I find Colonel Morley, disapproved of Sucha conduct, though in favour of his own child. “ W”e will never Suffer her to want,” Said he, “ but to replace her in her late enviable Sphere of life, will she an encouragement to vice, by depriving her indeed of the means of Support, you may render her still more infamous, but Suf^ fer her to be deprived of Superfluities, and deScend from elegancies to necessaries, and she will then have thoSe crimes in her remembrance, that occafioned the transition from her former Situation.”
Ah, my friend! I once loved this Sedgwick, my paffion was at one time more prevalent than my reaSon,—and
