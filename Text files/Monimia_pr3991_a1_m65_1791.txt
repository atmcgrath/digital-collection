Indulge thy Self, Gregory, laugh as much as thou wilt now—Soon shalt thou be Sorced to look grave; for aSter thou hast taken orders, and turned, O woeful day! thy tail into an humble curl, thy riSible Saculties must not be indulged. Confider well, friend, ere thou re-
.NOUN'CEST THE POMPS AND VANITIES
of this WICKED WORLD — comc, and .place thySelf only one month under my tuition, and I will give thee leave to post me up Sor an aSs, if 1 do not make thee give up thy intended plan.
You See by the date of my epistle that I have left Luihington Park to mourn the absence of its master, and am in the centre of pleaSure and happineSs. Now, Gregory, for all thy formal looks and demure afpeB, thou enviest me, I know. Youth, health, Spirits, and last, not least, three thou Sand pou nds a year—Egad, theSe are qualifications might tempt an anchorite to envy me..

You remember an old grey-headed penssoner who lives in a little thatched houSe at the end of the parh. The day before I Set out, I went to take riiv leave of him, when down dropt he upon his 'knees, and taking hold of my hand, in-
<<
yoked every happineSs upon my head. The bleffings of an old man,” Said he, accompany thee wherever thou goest. He has lived long enough to know that the only Solid comforts of age and misfortunes are, a heart defiled by no “ dishonourable a6Uon,debaSed by nounworthy deed.—Stray not, then, my dear young master, from the examples of thy worthy ancestors, and give not thy pa-rents cauSe, as they behold thee from their Sainted abodes, to blush for the conduSl of their Son.

Scattered o’er thy fertile plains to their poffefiion, and they will shew thee, by being contented, that they can be grateful.

often leads you to aSlions unworthy of
you.
I have indulged your letter with two peruSals—grant mine but half that num--ber.—Read over but^ once this piece of morality.^—ConSider me in my Sacerdotal^ capacity, and. pay attention^ accord--ingly..

In the tlioughtleSs iiey-day of the BLOOD,’* you are riding to the brink of a precipice, down which, however, when
you are arrived at it, (you may then See
*
your danger) you must inevitably Sail, For the better elucidation oS my advice, I will conSider you as purSuing two diS-Serent ends.
In the first place, I will follow you through the path of pleaSure—with a heart beating high with expeSfation—a constitution unimpaired—lord of a noble, unincumbered estate, you Set out.
'She first steps are agreeable, becauSe novel, enchanting—becauSe, as yet, you partake of the fragrance of the role without feeling the thorn that Surrounds
It.

Let' me now conlider you as taking: the other road, the road of reaSon. The first steps on this path, though not produSlive of Such rapture, afford that gentle pleaSure which increaSes as you advance onward, and the grows more and more delightSul in proportion as you view it nearer out conSumjng your estate, the poor are relieved through your means; the induS-trious are Supported; you are able, by

them to you; and though the perform-
ance of the latter part of the promife
contained in my last is not in my power.

at least the first is, which you may per-
haps be willing to difpenfe with.
My father was the only Son of a
gentleman, who from being too much
concerned in the rebellion lost an im-
menfe estate. The total ruin of the
caufe he had eSpoufed, and of his pro-
perty, broke his heart. On liis death-
bed he was touched with remorSe for the
part he had taken against his Sovereign,
and calling his Son, then about twenty
years of age, to his bedSide, intreated
him, with the wreck of what was left,
to purchafe a commiffion, and by fight-
ing in defence of his country, to make
Some atonement for the offences of his
father. The fon adhered stristly to the
intreaties of his parent, and colieSting

what remained oS all the effeSls, Sold

with which he entered into the armv.
In Several expeditions he gained ap-
plauSe, and by degrees was promoted to
the rank of captain. The colonel of
the regiment was a hot-headed youn^
man, with more warmth than prudence.
In company one evening, my Sather hav-
ing a diSpute with him, be upbraided
him with the adions of my grandfather.
Such an illiberal unmanly attack was not
to be borne. My father called him out.
but previous to the duel, as he knew
whatever were the confequences he could

no longer remain in the regiment, he Sold his commiffion. The colonel Suffered
Sor his imprudence; he was left mor-
tally wounded on the field, and my fa-
ther, with all his effeds, was forced to
ssiip himSelf Sor America. On their
paffage, an Algerine ship attacked them.

The youth eastly pardoned him; and thefimiliiude of their circumstances naturally producing an intimacy, he discovered that the youth belonged to the Same master as him Self, but being employed chiefly in the houfe, had been the reaSon of their never meeting be-Sore. My father now found the weight of stavery lefs oppreffive. In the evenings the young gentleman would accompany him in his walks, and while my father played on the flute, would join

My father replied, that if he did go, it would Solely be with a view of benefiting his friend and liim-Sclf, and trying to effeSl an eScape from ssavery. The youth appeared in better Spirits; and it was agreed between them, that my father should not fail to keep the appointment. In the evening, therer fore, he repaired to the arbour, where much time had not elapSed before a female richly dressed joined him.

“ I have been told, there are in Algiers certain fellows who, for a good Sum will transport us to Some part where we may be Safe from the power of thefe barbarians. Are you ready to lend me
in
your assistance ?”—My father the affirmative. “ Here are, then. Some jewels, take them and heaven proSper you.”
After having made an appointment at the Same place the next evening, the lady and my Sather parted. He was not dilatory in executing his commission ; but SenSible that caution was necessary, lie took care to Sound the Sentiments of thoSe fellows whom the lady defcribed to him before he trusted them with the extent of his commission. One he found, at length, who for the fake of a

fettled that the next evening they should
effeSf their eScape. At the appointed
time, the lady, the young gentleman.
and my father, attended in the arbour;
they had not been long there, when a
boat rowed up to the shore, in which
they all embarked, and were carried to
the vessel, which immediately Set Sail.
After a fortnight’s voyage, they arrived
at
where they Separated, the
lady embarking for France, and my fa

tention to steer his courSe to America;
he informed his friend of it, who being willing to accompany him, they took their
palSage in a ship bound to Philadelphia,
Their passage was not a very long one.

When she had finissied, my father

to be wondered that friendship on the

fenSation, or that the Same paffion filled
the boSom of the female ?-~In short.

It were only telling you a story with which you are well acquainted, to inform you of the various Successes of both

Before the end of the first
year, my father was taken while recon-noitering the fituation of the enemy, and conduced to priSon.
It was now that my mother’s fortitude began to fail.—We hastened with an old faithful negro to the place of my father's confinement.—It was with difficulty my mother reached the end of her journey; she was there taken with a fevere fit of Sicknefs. Think, Matilda, what was now the fituation of your friend—a father in prifon!—a mother dying!— in a country the feat of defolation and war !—The

My first care was to vifit my father.
I found him in a dark dungeon infeSIed
with noxious vapours and pestilential
Smells; he was Sitting in a corner of his
prifon upon Some straw, his head re-

pierced me to the Soul, invaded my ear.
as I entered this manfion of horror.

I Sprung to him, and threw my arms
round his neck.—“ Child,exclaimed
he, in a Saint voice, “ are you come to
behold your father in this Seat of mi-
Sery ?”—He burst into tears.—Oh! Ma-
tilda, when a* man weeps, I always think the tears come from the inmost
recesses of the heart. I ashed him hew

would come lo-morrow. All that after-

I Succeeded: and 1 left him rather more

Sound it impossible to conceal her
Situation from my Sather. I thought
now that he would have Sunk indeed.
In terms the most affeSiing he would be-
moan his Situation, the big tear trick-
ling all the while down his manly cheek.
Whenever the keeper entered, he would
on his knees implore him to permit a
moment’s interview with his wife; and
when that was reSuSed, would with eyes
thrown up to heaven, and his hands
-claSped together, intreal the mediation
of a higher power.

As Soon as the door was unbarred she burst into the dungeon ; ** Where is he—where is my Edward!” My father flew and clafped her in his arms. Ah, Edward, you do not love me—Why did you leave me when I was

possibly can, oS the anguish we both endured.
The melancholy death of my mother joined to the unwholeSoracneSs of the priSon, brought on my father an ague which would have deprived me of him, had not an exchange of prifoners re-leaSed him from conSmement. The length of time he had been in priSon, and the ague, had deprived him of the Life of his left arm, So that he was unable to join again the forces of his native country. The war raged with the greatest violence :—we found that we could not live peaceably where we were, and therefore turned our thoughts towards our native country. And here, Matilda, are we arrived, friendlefs and forlorn, in hopes that the Ioffes my father has Sustained in his fortune, and the injury done to his health, will have weight with the ministry.

EARFUL that our endeavours may be unattended with SucceSs, that our remonstrances may be treated with contempt, we have taken two Small-rooms in Jermyn-street, and live with the most rigid economy. You will alk me how I employ my time—how I amuSe my Self? Sometimes I read to my lather, in order to divert his thoughts, and to prevent our misfortunes Sroim taking too deep an effedt upon him. When I have tired mySelS with reading, I amuSe mySelf on my guitar. The uniSormity of the Scene, you, may think,

As Soon as he is Somewhat reco-vered from the fatigues of his voyage, my father means to wait upon the minister, and lay before him his unhappy cafe.—-You may then expeSl to hear from me again.

RE GORY, my boy, 1 am preparing to begin the race—The taylors and the other fellows necessary to qualify a man of my fortune and FIGURE for appearing with credit in the world, have done their duty, though I believe I have departed a little from the mode of conduSl adopted by bucks, in paying the raScals. But, hang it, I cannot bear to be under the lash and in the power of tradeSmen, and therefore shall follow the line of conduSt 1 have begun in this reSpeD.—This morning I have been Seeking elegant lodgings,

And now, Gregory, aSter having in-
formed thee of theSe necessary prelimi-
naries, I will make a comparison be-
tween thy Situation and mine, in order
to prove what a horrible dull fellow thou
art, and what a Spirited happy dog
I am.
In turning over pages of musty Greek
and Latin authors, thy mornings are
confuraed. At the found of a great
bell, thou goest to dinner, and perchance
afterwards takest thy share of an humble
bottle of port. In dry conversation on
college discipline, dull tricks played on
the proSlors, and bastards laid to thy
charge by antiquated bed-makers, thou
employest thy moments till tea-time, after
which, with a Solitary walk, as Solitary a
Supper, and a glaSs of punch, with a pipe
of tobacco, thy day ends. ‘‘ Oh, hor-
rible! MOST HORRIBLE!

System of condud keep thee ere thou madest a new acquaintance?—Tv;o years, perhaps, thou wilt anSwer. Ah, Gregory, at that rate I behold innumerable difficulties between thee and preferment. Thou hast no bronze, no im-pudence, consequently there is an inseparable bar to thy advancement. Attend, and I will reveal to thee my laft night’s adventure.

Swore eternal Sriendship, and then they
.conduSled me home in a coach, after we
had promifed to meet again the next

Now, Gregory, I wonder when thy
company will be So much courted! Ne-

PINEAL gland, and acquire a portion of
what the French term la vivaciie.

In order to give himfelf a monied look, I SuppoSe, he wears a bob wig, which, however it may anfwer the purpoSe intended, does not appear to me to be striStly a-la-mode.—But he is a man of fortune, and therefore may plead privilege to be as ridiculous or outre as he pleafes.
Give me leave to introduce, in the next place to your notice, Tim. Barton, ESq. quite the reverfe of the former gentleman in everything: — ssim, light, airy, with a wonderful deal of vivacity

CHARLES L U S H I N G T O N, Esq,
DEAR CHARLES,
ASK but five minutes Serious atten-
tion, and Surely you are not So much
attached to your new acquaintance but
you may grant to an old Sriend So Small
a request. Satisfied of this, I will Say a
few, and but a few words.
What, Charles, what are you going
to do?—Whither are your passions about
to carry you?—To certain, inevit-
able RUIN
Oh, Charles, and is every
Sentiment of virtue, every fpark of emu-
lation thus extinguished?—Now, while
your country calls for your ashstance in
the
M O I M I A v
49
the field, or in the cabinet, are you deaf
to her neceffities ? and, in the laScivious
lap of pleaSure, are you wasting your
health ,your time, your honour ?
And who are theSe new friends ?
Known to you Scarce a week.—From an
acquaintance only of this duration, are
you going to throw yourSelf entirelytin-
der their proteQion, and Submit to be
guided by them to do that for which I
would fain think, your heart must con-
demn you.—But go on—Advice, I fear.
will come too late.—Let experience
convince you I have told you the truth
though, perhaps, at the expence of
friendship.—Be ruined.
Add
ONE
MORE to the many who live deSpifed
instances of talents miSuSed, and Sor
tunes misapplied.

all human honours.—I will proceed, now
to the Substance of this epistle, and will
recount again the purport of my former
remonstrances, in order that should ever
the affair be made public, you may not
be able, however you may wish, to deny
the fadt.
On my first interview to you, I proved
that I diSpofed of my estate at a very
great disadvantage, expended the pro-
duce, Suffered a long imprisonment, and
much injury to rny health, for the Ser-
vice of my country; I therefore re-
quested Some compensation, with a full
expeSlation of not being denied.—I
meant not a compensation for the Service
I may have rendered my country, be-
eauSe the honour of having been able
to be of any Service to it, carries its re-
ward with it.
But that what my property had Suf-
fered, I judged (and cannot still think I

Some Suture period. But, Sir, you did’
not conSider that while I was waitincr the

incur the imputation' of unjust, whether
you have any claim to humanity or not.
It was not even this refuSal that carried
with it So great a stingi-as-'the inSolent
shperiority which accompanieddt.
If, young man, you shew'ed no ten-
derneSs to me as the ruined Supporter of
my country, you might have done to my
age

This lovely roSe-bud, this beautiSul girl, whoSe unfortunate fituation I have been So anxious to relieve, is, 1 am informed, a prostitute; and he who pro-feffes to be her father, an infamous bully.

At School I remember reading of a certain law called Lex Talionis; Anglice, Retaliation. —My pretty little girl, I INTEND to make thee know what that law means.—-So look to thySelf.

Y fortunate stars prefented me with as favourable an opportunity to execute my deSign as poffible. As I was in my dreffing-room yesterday morning, I heard the tip-toe tread of a female in my drawing-room. I opened the door, and beheld the lovely girl in the attitude of admiring one of the piSlures.
Blushing she would have left the room, but I prevented her, and began

I was absolutely petrified, nor for the the foul of me could I rife to prevent her making her eScape out of the room. From this, I was inclined to believe that what I had heard before was not true, But I am a novice I find.
My friends tell me it is not an uncommon method of conduSl adopted by Such women in order to enhance their value.
If that be her intention, she may find herSelf mistaken. Once she has deceived me, and I should be an idiot indeed if I Suffered her a Second time.

I burst into tears, and throwing my arms round his neck, Sobbed out that I knew not how to bear the loSs of him. He had been Summoning fortitude enough to talk to me, but this deprived him of it entirely. He struggled to conceal his emotions, but finding it impossible, threw lus arms around me, and wept aloud.
It was Some time before he could Sup« prefs his feelings enough to Speak to me -again. “ Child,” continued he, reach me that trunk.”—I gave it him; he opened it.

HE rebuff I met with Swayed me
not Srom my purpoSe. — I reSolved
on purSuit the first favourable opportu-
nity.—Last night, warm with the pro duce of the vine, I returned homej-
the Soft tread of a female foot over my
head. Seemed to invite me, and I re
Solved to steal up stairs, and try if, Lo
thario like, I could prevail. It was paft
midnight—the whole houSe was wrapped

M O N I M I A.
in Silence: I own I was rather ashamed
of what I was going to> undertake, but
quickly recolleBing mySelf, I stole with
gentle pace up stairs. The dim glim-
mering of a candle direOed me to the
chamber—I opened the door and en-
tered.—The lovely girl was Sitting at i
%
table, her head SoStly preffing one hand.
a white handkerchief in the other.—At
t
Sight of me she started up, and uttered
a Saint Scream. I flew to her, and
dropping on one knee, ‘ Fear not, my
‘ life, I Said, Oh ! fear not. I come, be-
lieve rile, not to do thee harm.’ I
then gently Seized her hand, and would
have imprinted a kiSs on it, but she
drew it hastily away, and walked ma
jestically to a bed in the room.

If my
defenceleSs state Secures me not from
“ inSult, behold,” and she drew afide
the curtains; I looked—and, gracious
God I Saw the corpSe of a man laid on

The dear girl’s emotions were toa violent for human nature to Support; she Sunk on the bed and fainted. Luckily, there was fome water in the room, with which I recovered her. 1 felt, and I dare fay I looked like a criminal at the bar of justice. I would have stammered out an apology for my condufi, but the dear girl waved her hand, and pointed to the door; upon which I bowed and retired, overwhelmed with that shame which vice always feels when rebuked by virtue.

In order that the dear girl might not

J
me, and I was forced to lean against the wainScot. The coffin passed, and still I had not strength Sufficient to crawl up stairs. — In deep black, lovely in her tears, the Sweet mourner followed with a melancholy pace. The fight of a man in Such an attitude startled her, and (he took hold of the ballustres to Support herSelf down.
Forgetful of every thing but the ob* jeSl before me, I raifed my head, and stammered out, ‘ If, Madam, you are not too much offended with a wretch ‘ who has wronged you. Suffer him to * offer you his arm.’ She hefitated a moment, but did not Speak. I therefore

stopped at
churchyard, where the
clergyman was waiting to perform the Service. I stood at Some distance while the ceremony was performing, but when it was ended, and the body depofited in its last lone habitation, I walked up to the grave.
He must, indeed, be possessed of great Spirits, or very little feeling, who can look upon the grave without fome Serious refle0;ion. I, even I, WilSon, began refle6: on this Sure period of all human enjoyments, all human purfuits. I know not how long I might have remained in this contemplative mood, if an objeft which approached towards me, had not roufed me from my meditations.

Still the objed approached, and at length came up to the grave, where with a kind of anxious horror I waited for the event.
The night was So dark that I could not perceive whether the perfon was male or female, till the following words, uttered in a faint pathetic tone, convinced me.

That my fituation is irkSome you cannot be ignorant of, but it is rather lightened by occaSional vi-fitants, who flutter round me, becauSe they think me a fortune, and whifpcr nonfenSe which they call love. My guardian cares not wdao comes. So they intrude not, on his table, and as I find tea, he becomes delighted by an intercourse with strangers, and leaves me to aB as I pleaSe.

not complain to her, she might think it ungrateful.
The bell rings for me—who can want me ? I am SurpriSed-—confuSed—vexed. Upon obeying the Summons, Mrs. Allerton defired me to go and entertain Lord Blagrave, as she was going out.

I knew how inSipid the conversation would be, and therefore ashed him iS I should disturb him by playing an air on the harpfi^ chord.
I obeyed—he Seemed in extacy—my voice, my taste, my execution ravished him;—he Seized my hand, and mumbled it with kisses as violent as they were diSgustSul.

He attempted to Sooth my anger, and dropping on one knee in a tragedy attitude, blubbered out a Speech in blank verSe—the Scene was too ridiculous—but in an instant railing hirafelf up, caught me in his short arms, and like another Pluto, would have carried off his ProSerpine to—a bed chamber the very next room;—but having no convenient dagger, or if I had, unwilling to be So heroic as to uSe one on a titled reptile, with one hand I gave him a hearty box of the face, and with the other pushed him with Such force, that the little lord absolutely fell down on the floor.—He stared at me with a most favage aSpeQ :—Gad’s life! what

At dinner, I told Mrs. Allerton of his behaviour, not doubting but that I should get my little lord diSmiffed from the houSe ; but gueSs my SurpriSe when she blamed m.e sharply for my conduD, Said it was a common mark of distinction, and I ought to have thought it an honour ; infisting at the fame time, that when he came again I should ash his pardon.
I could not utter a word,—I was hurt to the quick,—I burst into tears.—Surely, Matilda, I deServed not this Severe reprimand ; — Some allowance ought to be made for my inexperience ;—I knew not that fuch behaviour was right, nor

I vras tired with happy Sace.s, and per-Suaded my Garcias to wander towards Some more Secluded fituation. We had loitered on, perhaps a couple of miles, for enchanting converSe prevents fatigue, when we stopt at once, to enjoy the Situation of a cottage, more romantically gloomy than fan,cy itfelf could piSIure. Here, I exclaimed in a rapture, with just money enough to keep distrefs at a distance, and love enough to enjoy each other beyond Society, two fond hearts might be exquifitely blest!—It Seemed the retreat for mutual affeSHon, I donst know how, but the piSlurefque appearance awed me into tears.

Ilufband, kind and attentive, would have
Soothed me to peace again, but the
agitation overcame me, and I had nearly

Sor
alSistance, and knocking violently, the
door opened, and an old venerable
figure approached me, a figure So unlike
humanity, it Seemed rather the emana-
tion of a Spirit than the body of a man.
He approached me with an elegant ten
derneSs, and in the best language, en-
treated me to retire into his homely
dwelling; remarking, that although he
had long ago left the world, its Sollies,
and its crimes, he had not forgot what
was due to hofpitality, to Semale delicacy.
and thoSe claims which man has upon
man.
The infide of the building was
homely indeed, and sh was our fare, for
there was nothing but cates, fome dried

I made Some remark to Garcias in En-
glish (Sor our conversation had been in
French beSore) when the old man threw
Such a look at me, and burst into So
violent an agony that overpowered na-
ture, and gave my gratitude an oppor-
tunity oS returning that indulgence he
had So handSomely shewn to me. He
opened his eyes, but to agonies still
greater, and to have leSt him alone
would have been brutal. It was Some
hours beSore he recovered, and it was be-
come too late Sor our return, we there-
Sore threw' ourSelves on the straw mat-
traSs, while he retired to a little room,
wdiere (as he told us his custom was) he
meant to dedicate the hours till morning
in Solemn prayer. Our curioSity was ex
cited—we courted and enjoyed a hasty
steep—and with the first stashes of the
morning he joined us. “ You will won-
der, Madam, (addressing himSelf to me

with Something like compoSure) you will wonder, Madam, at thoSe agitations age like mine could betray, without Sinking me into the grave. —Alas! that only happineSs yet remains Sor me.—You are an Englishwoman, may the God of mercies bleSs you with all the joys, which the virtues, the tenderneSs, the truth, the innocence of Englishwomen entitle them to. But we do not always in a life like this, reap the fruit of our merits.—Oh! Sophia.—Would you hear the story of a woman who wanted none of them.—But do not curfe me, I would have the prayers of all.—My story is not known here, but that you drew the fame air in infancy with my Sophia, it Ihould be locked here still.—Here in my heart!—I will now relate it for the last time, and if poffible complete it by my death.”—Here he looked,— Oh! my Mqnimia, it is impossible to defcribe

how!— and aSter a world oS fighs, he
went on thus:
My Sophia was Srom a family of
distindion in England, remarkable for inflexibility of Sentiment, and a repub-
lican pride, of which her father was an
early viDim; for in one of thoSe tumul-
tuous moments. So frequent in that king-
dom, he flew to arms ; his party was foon
defeated, and he w^as perSecuted by the
court without being proteDed by the na-
tion.— He was thrown into the common
priSon, and died like a hero, in the
arms of his wife and daughter, conjuring
them not to diSgrace themSelves by Soli-
citing his pardon.—After catching the
last Sighs of a fond father, Sophia, in
honour to his memory, vowed the deepest
hatred to that country, which, in his diS-
treSs, bad forSaken him,—Her Soul was
formed with equal faculties to love or
to abhor, with that noble energv with
which

i
M O N I M I A.	165
which every great mind is agitated. Her mother bore the Same Sentiments, and they both determined to leave a Soil, the very fight of which inflamed the memory of ingratitude. The remains of a fcattered fortune, lessened by a long Series of difasters, was eaSily colleDed; it was moderate, but Sufficient to fliield them from the inclemencies of cold and hunger. Nor were they reduced to accept the chilling offers of assistance from dead friendship, or pretended benefactors, who are a Species of mental alSaf-Sins, that distribute gold with one hand, and dishonour with another. Rejedling refources they deSpiSed, and contented with what fate had left them, they came to refide in this neighbourhood, not far
'1*
from whence my regiment was in garri-fon. Accident, and a flight occafion of Service, brought me acquainted with them—acquaintance ripened into friendship

At this period, family concerns drew me to a distant part of the country; the parting of Such hearts as our’s is not to be destcribed.—My Sather had proS-pe8s for me of Such a nature as would have dissipated all my hopes; and his austerity permitted no explanation from me.—I evaded every endeavour to discover my Secret, and every Scheme that Seemed inimical to my best wishes.

The wine drank here as the common beverage of the country, is by no means So palateable as our thin metheglin. In reSpeD to refining the people, Smoothing the roads, bettering the inns, and fcattering a little more plenty, liberty might have an excellent cffedt, but God only knows whether the people would'be happier,.

gaping Solemnity about them that pleaSed
me much. The livelineSs of the dam-

I had heard Garcias talk of the fandango, and requested to be indulged with one : you cannot conceive any thing more exquiSitely contrived to raiSe the paf-fions, and Soften the heart; it is on the plan of that which the great Spartan law-giver, Lycurgus, instituted,andfeems peculiarly neceffary to melt the frozen, male affeDions of this country, for the Spaniards looked on Such lovelinefs of form, Siich expreffive attitudes. Such Speaking eyes, fuch animation of countenance, as would have fet our little istand in a flame, with an apathy that made me hate them. ADivity, grace, elegance, and beauty could never be

Oh! I am miSerable, wretched, indeed! Matilda, to what am I doomed !-—You are SurpriSed — astonished. — I will, if poffible, relate to you the particulars.

I started up, and Screamed.—It will not avail you any thing,” exultingly Said be, “ here are no Quixotes to come to your relief, therefore you had better hold your tongue.”—Execrable villain! thinkest thou to prevail by violence ; and addest thou, infult to injury.

at me.—I Saw there was nothing to be

dragged me to the end of the room.

hanging in the cloSet: ---this was a def-

There was no time to be lost, he might return with affistance ; I dragged, therefore, the drawers, and fet them against the door, in order to prevent its being burst open.

Seen his little bark wrecked on Some unknown shore, who- has Survived the horrors of the storm to wander friend-leSs over Some deSert plain, I am left alone, and without a friend, to encounter: a fad variety of woes,—Well! be it So! you. will ash me, perhaps, whither are

the door, and led me into the parlour;
on my entrance, an old gentleman, but
not Lord Blagrave, roSe and bowed very
politely.

You will keeip this Gentle-

Sir.’’—I looked at her with a Supplicat-
ing look, and Sate down. — Fresh in-
fults, thought I; what more am I to en-
dure !—Young lady, you look uneaSy,
(Said the old gentleman,) in a voice full
of pity.”—Ah! Sir, have I not rea-
fon!”—Indeed! may, I know? I may
be a Sriend.”—I looked up to him ; his
comely grey locks, and a certain benig-
nity of countenance Seemed not formed
for deceit;* they inSpired me with hope.
I roSe, fell at his feet, and burst into
tears.—You can, indeed. Sir, be a
friend to me; and. Oh ! Heaven knows
how much I want one !”—-He raifed me

Poor girl! and I will be thy friend; perhaps thou art not So far gone in guilt, but thou may’st refleQ; on thy fitua-tion with horror!"—‘‘Oh! no, Sir!. I am not guilty indeed; I knew not what houSe this was; I was Seduced to it." And I told him in what manner, and what treatment I had experienced in it.
He heard me with attention ; pauSed a moment; and then Said, “ Child, you may rely on me; I came here on no bad purpoSes; you must dilSemble; you must appear chearful, and to-morrow cxpeD me."—Mrs. Allerton’s coming in prevented him from faying more. Conversation on different Subjedls filled up the rest of the time the old gentleman staid, and at parting he gave me a look, which told, me I might depend.on him.,

chearSul, and Mrs. Allerton w'as deceived.—I was, you may be Sure, anxious for the coming of the next day.—Hope,
fear, joy and Sorrow, alternately took, poffeffion of my heart.
The morning, at length, arrived, and about twelve o’clock I Saw a coach stop,, and from which the old gentleman alighted and came in. He chattered with Mrs. Allerton and mySelf for about five minutes, and then pretending to have forgot Something, hurried out of the room to the coach,, and returned, bringing with him two other gentlemen; I guessed the cauSe.—” Give me leave, Mrs. Allerton, to introduce my friends.’' She did not SuSpeD any thing, and received them courteoussy.—After about a quarter of an hour’s stay, they aroSe to depart: ‘‘ Come, Madam, are you ready to go ?” Said my deliverer to me.

I will deSend you.”—“ Mighty fine, mighty fine, gentlemen,” cried the wicked Mrs. Allerton, “ but you do not think that I will tamely Suffer you to carry my niece away with you,”—“ Your niece, indeed ! old inSamy.” The woman moved towards the bell; no doubt to call her Servants. “ Not one step,.

GLANVILLB THE WANDERER;

COLONEL BEVERLEY
'C'ARTH must return to earth !-Dust must mingle again with il! native dust!—There is no alternative,-I have been meditating over a grave on the ill-nature of man, which prompt him to record the failings of perfons o their tombs.
Read the following inscription.
“ Here rests the body of the once ad mired LouiSa; on her cheeks the roft and the lily were So blended, that it wat

impossible to Say which prevailed most.
The whiteneSs of the lily her mind
would have alSo rcSembled, but for one
aSlion, which Sullied all her virtue, and
deprived her of her innocence.—De-
ferted by her friends. Scorned by the
world, she drooped, and under this Sod
lies interred.
fy
I will fit me down by the poor girl's
grave, and write an elegy. It is the first
time I have indulged mySelf in the
poetic strain, and I Send it you;
LOUISA, AN ELEGY.
Long from this heated heart has pleafure flown.
And long this head has eeas’d to find repofe.
And many a tear this pallid cheek adown Befpeaks a bofom tenanted by woes !
And long my wearied footfteps too have ftray’d
From blythe Euphrofyne’s enlivening train.
To fit beneath the folitary fhade.
And woo ,pale Melancholy to my flrain.

From no fond friend allays this bofom’s grief.
t
No parent lives to hufh my woes to reft ;
From ftrangers vainly might I alk relief,
Or bid them foothe the horrors of my breaft.
Hence to the darkfome dwellings of the dead.
The church-yard drear, I take my way alone;
And bending o’er Louifa’s turf-grown bed.
Try in her forrows to forget my own.

Ah! ne’er a fairer face, a finer form
I
From Nature’s pencil into being glowed;
Ah! ne’er a heart more generous and warm

In Virtue’s caufe, on mortal was beftowed.
But from the thorny path once lur’d to ftray.
Her fteps (he turn’d incautioufly afide ;
Cull’d but ONE flower, diflik’d the vicious way, j
Return’d to virtue, and repenting died.
By Him forgiven, who fcts enthron’d above.
In heaven, Louisa, may’ft thou end thy woes! I
'Tis there alone this heart can pleafure prove.

’Tis there alone the wretch can find repofe.

CHARLES LUSHINGTON, Esq.

Mr. GREGORY WILSON.
»
H A V E turned my thoughts to what
I shall do, in order to procure my-
Self a livelihood.—I have been educated
to no profession, and thereSore reSoIved
to commence author. Thinking I had
Some talents for Satire, I wrote st short
essay on the conduD of the preSent mi-
nistry, which I Sent to a morning anti-
ministerial print. It was Soon inSerted,
with a note from the editor requesting
to fee the author.—-You may be Sure, I
went.

M O N I M I A.
Bl
went.—A little fat man, wearing his own hair, received me with the greatest cordiality.—He informed me that he was the editor, and that if I would continue my essays he would make it worth my while.—I thanked him, and promised to Send him another in a day or two.'
Upon hearing my intention of treading the paths of literature, he offered to introduce me to a club of authors, who met every week at a houSe in Fetter-lane : being totally diSengaged, I agreed to accompany him there.— My little
editor, I Sound, was a man of fome con-
*
fequence with the club, for upon his entrance they all roSe up to receive him, with the greatest civility.
After the uSual falutations, we fate down round a table, in the middle of which was a large bowl of punch, which

the whole body corporate Seemed to eye with peculiar Satisfadion.
Though a stranger, each was So much engrossed with his own thoughts as to negledl me, and thereSore I had leiSure to make ray remarks on the different members.
The prefident, is a hard-Seatured, black looking man, with a peculiar Severity oS countenance, his hair Sailing with uncombed luxuriance over his Sace, and down his back, which my Sriend informed me, was owing to his contempt Sor the modern Sorms of dreSs. A great coat, big enough Sor two, encircled his body, and was kept buttoned with particular care; which in the courSe of the evening he told us, was a very excellent pro-teDion, against cold, to which he was very fubjeSl; for the fame reaSon, I conjeSlure, that he choSe to Surround his

than a neckcloth.
The length of the fleeves of his great
coat prevented me Srom taking a Survey
of his linen, which no doubt was clean
and fine.

Turn we now to the prefident’s de-
puty.—little thin pale-Saced mortal.
dressed in black ; his hair, of which he
could not boast much, was quite grey.
and roSe on the top with a bussiineSs,
reSembling very much a cockatoo's head.
Shirt I could See none; but in order to
diSplay a muffin neck-handkerchief to
greater advantage, his waistcoat was
unbuttoned almost to the bottom.
The fignal was now given for the
attack on the punch, each glaSs was in
motion, and my observations were effec-
tually put an end to.—The liquor had

gave a Sample of his prevailing diSpofi-tion.
The prefident boasted, with much pompoSity, of a manuScript Sent him by a nobleman, to peruSe, “ but d—n his Lordship, Said he, I cannot read it, it is So vilely written.”
The deputy-pressdent talked much of a constitutional Song he had written, which was received with the greatest applaufe.
, An author at my elbow, by his blaf-phemy and lewd diScourfe, I Set down for a writer for the Anacreontic Society, nor was I deceived; he was telling his neighbour of a new Song he intended to Sing at the next meeting of the Society, There was Some humour in the man> but it was So intimately conneSled with blaSphemy and bawdry, as to shock, while it even occafioned a laugh,

I was inclined to enter into conversation with him, but my conductor whiS-pered in my ear, that he had formerly been a strong oppolitionist, but Sor a paltry Sum had turned a violent ministerialist.—As I have a natural abhorrence to a deSertion of principles or party, I thought the man below my notice, and behaved accordingly.
The preSidenSs hammer coming in ContaD with the table, with much violence, stopped the mouths of every one: An univerfal filence reigned.—I wondered what was the reaSon of it.
The prefident foon put an end to my astonishment: “ Gentlemen, (Said he,) we must now attend to the concerns of the fociety. Mr. Steady, I will begin with you, what have been your pur-fuits ?"—Why, Mr. Prefident, I have been very unfuccefsful. You know I \vrote a pamphlet in favour of the minif-

Mr. Macdashane, you have Succeeded in your endeavours, your change of dreSs declares it.”—Ah ! Maester Prefident, too long had I continued aniohg the ungodly ; but it pleaSed Heaven to give me grace : 1 have had a call, and am one of the choSen.”
” Humph! So you have turned Methodist.”
The landlord’s coming in, prevented
a reply. Going up to the prefident, he
whirpered Something in his ear. The
information I Saw was of conSequence,
for the prefident turned as pale as ashes.
Gentlemen, we must break up, there

window, be leaped out into the street ;
every one attempted to Sollow his ex-
ample, and to get first out, which _oc-
cafioned a total stoppage. Sists now
came in motion, and blows were dealt
about very quick. The methodist par-
Son was not behind hand, Sorgetting at
once his godlineSs, he burst into a volley
of oaths, and lifting up a most ponderous
fist, darted it with peculiar strength into
the stomach of the deputy-preSident,
who immediately returned the compli-
ment by discharging the contents of his
stomach on the cloaths of his antagonist.
who growing outrageous by this Salute,
and having his breeches and waistcoat
thus ill treated, took the little deputy by
his body and Sairly threw him out of
window.

The best Security for a huSband, is con~ iidence, unlimited confidence!—He who SuSpeDs, deServes to SuSpeSl truly !—She must be abandoned indeed, who plants a dagger in that heart which loves her, when affeBion alone affords her the means and

I obeyed in Sullen Silence; and he Seemed by his behaviour to expeD, that a pout, and a tear, and a frown, would Soon give way to Smiles, kisses, and forgive-nefs. I obey him, for he is my huf-band; I forgive him, for he is a Spa-niard; but for my Smiles and my kisses, they are at an end. No!

Mr. GREGORY WILSON,
N this early stage of my profelSion,
I have had occafion to remark on the
precarious and unprofitable condition of
an author. What a variety of difficulties
has he to encounter ! In the first place,
Rs he writes for bread, it is not to be
fuppoSed that he can follow the advice
of Horace,

It, thereSore, Seldom happens, but that
his piece comes into the world with
many, and perhaps glaring faults, which,.
could he have bestowed Sufficient time
in the correfting of his work, would not
have been the cafe. Critics are too apt
alSo, to expoSe the faults of a work, in
order to shew their own diScernment:
they forget the excellencies which might
counterbalance thofe faults, and the bad
qualities, therefore, being alone laid be-
fore the public eye, the author is instantly
Set down for a fool.
You will wonder how, in So short a
time, I could have acquired this know-
ledge—By an attention to the advice
and experience or my little editor. I
have written two or three more essays
for him, which he does me the favour
to praiSe, and I fuppofe will not fail to
keep his'promiSe v/kh refpedf to the re-
comp e nee

WilSon, I was once in a condition to
have raiSed the drooping head oS genius
MYSELF, and by my patronage to have
t
brought it into notice: now ! Oh, my
friend, I try to avoid the recolleDion of
the past as much as poffible; but tbofe
happy Scenes will Sometimes intrude into
my mind ; I cannot Sorget what I once
was—what I now am! Like Othello, I
may exclaim.
Farewell
Othello’s occupation’s gone!”
I partake- of but few amuSements, I
■write and read all day ; in the evening
I relax my mind, Sometimes by going to
the theatres; ignorant of what the play
was, I strolled into the pit of Drury-
lane last
night
the tragedy of the
Gamester was performing; indepen-

The other door is X Sufficiently Secured; proceed we therefore to buSineSs.’'
The information was received with applauSe, and we all took our feats. The president began :

It is recommended to the author to make it a little lefs refemblance of a tragedy.
The next bears the appellation of Instructive Tales, on which the

But there were two of the club who had

plaintive, arrested my attention as. I was
paffing it. S was Srightened, and knew not whether to enter it, or make the
best of ray way home. While J
was
deliberating within my Self, a perSon, with
a quick and hurried step, came out of it
with a book in his-hand. His figure
attraSled me. particularly ; his cloaths
were genteely made, shut put on care-
leSsly. His long black hair hung ne-
gligently, and in curls down his back;
and round his head, in the form of a
crown, ivy was intwined.
He was viewing a book most atten-
tively, which all at once he put in his
pocket, and exclaimed, You think
I’ll weep ! No ! I will not weep !

Throwing his eyes wildly round, I
caught his attention;—he started. I was
Serioussy alarmed ; for I did not doubt

He Said no more, but walked away
I was astonished, the adventure was So ■
romantic. Returning home, I enquired
of my kind friends, whether, they had
Seen him Lack-a-daySy, MiSs," re-

a most beautiful cataraSl, which became

in principles a perfeD libertine ; but
being the most complete master of diffi
mulation, he passed in the camp for a
man of striD honour, which 'charafier
he, from the moment he beheld Rofalie,
determined to keep up, with more ex
aclneSs than he had hitherto done; this
resolution was strengthened by her mar
riage
he, therefore, as Soon as Viner
was gone, endeavoured, with great afli-
duity, to gain the friendship of her fa
ther, who ignorant of his defigns, and thinking him a man of Some genius,
readily entered into his company and
friendthip ; . particularly as he expreffed
great fricndOiip fpr his Son-in-law, whidi
at once gained him the confidence of Ro
falie, who hung on every word that com
mended him, who in her eyes was per

What was the fituation of her mind, is

cowl, and one of the pillars of huma-

tributed in its event to Spread a deeper

of my evening traces through the wood,
a wolf, gnashing his teeth with hunger
and expeDation, darted out of the thickeft

way towards me up the glade; fo care
worn were, my hopes, his appearance

This letter gave both pleafure and pain to RoSalie ; the knowledge of Soon beholding her beloved father, was a balm that Somewhat mitigated the Sad thought of the Colonel’s poffibly meeting Lef* ter; her imagination preSented with horror her hushand weltering in his blood, with Lester’s Sword plunged in his bo-Som.

The faithful girl who had been So kind to Lucretia,, took care of the cottage, and the two friends Set out for the camp, where they found Don Alonzo waiting with impatience to embrace a child So juftly loved. RoSalie was shocked at the ravages grief had made upon her father, but was comforted by his assurance, that her preSence would Soon recover his wonted Spirits. RoSalie now, in the anxious hope that the Colonel would not find Lester, passed Some days of torment; but at length her fears were put an end to by the return of Viner; he came—he Saw—he blessed her; never was rapture raiSed higher j never was love more honoured than by* their faithful attachment: their meeting is more eafily felt than defcribed ; it was

This morning I was disturbed by the Servant, who came to tell me a perfon wanted to Speak to me. I knew not who it could be, but not being yet in fear of bailiffs, I delired he might be shewn up.

It was the good old Jenkins; his Sor-mer admonitions struck me with So much shame that I could not Speak; I would willingly have had the earth open, and encloSe me in her bowels Srom his, and from the fight of every one. He looked at me, shook his head, and burst into tears. 1 recolleSled myfelf immediately, and taking hold of his hand, alked him how he did. Ah ! ,my young master, I thought not to have lived to

We Spent the whole day together, and he would not even be per-fuaded to leave me then, till I assured him that I was in a fair way to provide for myfelf genteely.

As well as my weakneSs would let me, I have written them, and they are contained in that packet. Oh ! I feel my-felf going fast. I would Say a few more words with regard to my body ; I have requested in that letter to Colonel Beverley, that it may be laid in the fame grave with my Anna, whom I hope to join in a happier world than this. For your humanity, dear Lady, to a poor wretched dying man, I thank you, and hope it will not be unrewarded. Blest Sings, and the Almighty’s proteBion, attend”—He lived not to finish the Sentence, but heaving a deep figh, and clof-ing his eyes, expired.

HIS removal, ray dear Monimia, has been highly pleafing to me; it has shewn me a country of whidi I had heard much, and my knowledge of the language has as it were domefticated me with the people.

times volatile even to levity. I had a
young laSs with me yesterday, whoSe ex-
travagance in modest levities delighted
me; she laughed. Sung, danced, and
played enchantingly. This was only
while we were alone, Sor on the approach
of Garcias her pretty animated eyes Sunk
into the demure, and her whole coun-
tenance became fombre, I remarked
this to her with much’Surprize, on his
going out again, and received for an-
fwer, that she had been taught never to
appear delighted in the company of men.
nor permit them even to guefs at the
workings of the Soul from the turn of
the countenance, for gravity was ever
efteemed diScreetneSs and maiden-like
modesty.
Thus are women educated
but to deceive, and men are juggled to
marry—faith they know not what. In
this
country, indeed, most matches are
made

My intimacy with her Sather naturally produced a kind of friendship with his only child—his Anna; for whom I Soon felt certain tender fenSations. But not to tire you with fcenes which are only to a lover interesting, I told her a tender tale, which she did not hear with difgust; and in fine, stole from the blushing girl a foft confeffion of a mutual flame. I was now happy beyond expreffion; whenever unkindly treated at home, L could go, and in the bofom of my Anna pour my complaints, and

Anna was a treaSure which I valued Sar
above all the wealth in the univerSe.
The good man was a great friend to
the poor, and, as far as his income could
afford, would relieve their wants, and by
advice comSort them in affliSIion. He
had been to administer the Sacrament
one evening to a perSon ill of a malig-
nant fever, on his return he found hiin-
Self unwell, and went to bed, from which
lie never roSe.
The next morning he was taken vio-
lently ill, and his complaint was pro-
nounced by the doctors to be incurable.
Above the fear of death, be-^ auSe he
could die with a conScience unSullied by
guilt, he received the information with.
\
a ferene and placid countenance, which
Seemed to Say, The will of God be
done, to which I bow with fubmiffion.

His daughter and mySelf attended him
night and day with unremitting assiduity;

ASter the burial of the good man, I' removed my Anna from the parSonage-houSe, where she could no longer remain, to Some distance from the village, where I employed my y/stole time in trying to conSole her Sor the loSs she had Sustained. ASter the period which decency requires us to mourn had elapSed,
I bethought raySelf oS the dying words of the good man ; I was SenSible my father would not conSent to my union with the lovely Anna, but what could I ought I to have done! the dear girl was left defenceless and alone. The fond hope of my being a proteDion to his child, had Soothed the good man in his dying moments; and it may be added to this,, that I loved her with the most fincere affeHion. In short, we were married. . Sure Heaven had exhausted its kindneSs in forming my lovely wife.

to my imagination! though the cold
grave has long concealed thee from my
fight, fain would thy Edward pay thee
here a tribute of his affeSlion !
Though reduced by him to feel a Sad

a word of complaint, or receive him but
with a Smile of affeSIion ! Often hast

to behold, without being able to de-

upon him !

I looked to See if there was any houfo nigh, or any help; not a houSe was to be Seen nor one human creature.
Lord Blagrave now began his odious
conversation, which, too much taken up
with my own torturing refletiions, I paid
not the Smallest degree of attention to.

We drove for about eight hours, as near as I can gueSs, over barren heaths, and through uiifi'eque.nted roads, still at last having gained the Summit of a hill, the chaife turned to the left j and having passed through a narrow lane, drove up an avenue of old trees, to an antique castle, where it stopped.
Alighting, I was conduced into an apartment, into which Lord Blagrave followed me. Approaching me in the most inSulting manner, he welcomed me to Albury-castle. My Lord,” replied I, hear'me : I am in your pow'er, it is true; but are you aware of the conSe-

“ Come, come, my dear girl, don’t be

he advanced to take me in his arms.

Y little Spaniard, Monimia, has more wit and ingenuity than the recluSe English girl, who is generally awkward, and what is very unjustly called, very modest; and she has been all her liSe a recluSe. She has laid open a train of stratagems and contrivances, which would not have diSgraced a Ma* chiavel in love. Her story, in the ab-

the forlorn fituation of an author.
This was but the prelude to a most

aSked me, if I had So great a prepoS-

not to wish to follow any other.
I replied, that there was no other
purfuit that I did not prefer to it. He
then mentioned the army; ashed me if
I should have any objeSIion to feeing
Some Service: and if I had none would
endeavour to procure me a commiffion.

A large room prelented itSelf to my vieWj which by the feeble light of the candle Seemed to be an armoury, for it was hung with Spears, helmets, and coats of mail on all fides,

I was ready to fink with fear, but re-
what I must Suffer if I returned to my chamber, I went on; I had just got to the door, at the end of the hall, when one of the helmets fell on the floor.
I streamed, and looked back to fee if any one purfued me j but feeing what it was, I mustered up my fortitude, and opened the door, which had been a long while shut, for it was with difficulty I could open it. I beheld a long gallery, through which I walked, or rather ran, my bofom heaving with the most fearful apprehension. At the end of the gallery, a flight of stone stairs impeded my eScape; I destended them quick, and when I came to the bottom, a dark paffage lay before me ; through this I alfo passed, and came to a door, which conduced me to a place of an oval form, I walked strait Sorward; when I

had got as far as the middle of the

fage; and upon holding the candle to fee what it was, I read theSe words:

** Here doth lie the bodie of Geoffry de
Mount-Acute.”

I was convinced I had got into the burying place of the poffeffors of the castle. My hair stood on end; my teeth chattered, and my hand shook fo violently that I let the candle fall, and it went out. What now was to be done! I could go no farther. I wonder, riow, I did not die with fear. The Wind blew loud, and hurtling through the turrets and decayed parts of the castle, made a most dreadful noife. The thunder
I
roared terrible ; the lightning defeended in flashes, and by its momentary light shewed me various tombs and statues of men kneeling; I shut my eyes, in order

to avoid beholding theni, and shieeling

In this posture, till the dawn oS day, I
remained.
When it was Sufficiently light to dis-
cover objeDs, I looked round, and be-
held another door, which I unbolted.
and which led me to another passage.
through which I passed, and Sound my-
Self in front of the castle. Fearful of
being discovered by Some of the inmates
of the castle, I ran as hard as my legs
could carry me, for the Space of three
miles; fatigue obliged me then to rest
mySelf. While I was fitting here, a
cart passed by, in which was an old
man, who upon feeing me, ashed if I
was going to
and offered me a
ride. I accepted the offer with joy, and
was driven to a place of Safety. I re-
Solved not to remain long here, and I
debated within my Self what I should do.

I negleSled them for Some time, but re-
collecting the dear girl’s request, I
opened the trunk the other day.
At the top was her father’s will, to
which was annexed particulars of a
large estate in America, in cafe govern-

the American loyalists; leaving her pro-
per vouchers, and the amount of thofe
claims.
There were Some papers underneath
of very little confequence, but at the
bottom of the trunk was a certificate of
her father’s marriage to Mon i m i a Be-

drop—a fudden pain shot to my heart.

My benefador approached the bed. He had no fooner cast his eyes on the dear girl, than he started and exclaimed. Gracious God! I thank thee.'" She looked at him, and clafping her hands together, Almighty God ! thou hast heard my prayer." The old man fell on her neck, kissed her and wept aloud : My child ! my child!

But child, you must thank this gentleman for being the occafion of finding you out.” I approached; she cast her fine blue eyes upon me, blushed, and with a faltering voice returned me her warmest thanks.
The phyfician coming in, was Surprised at the alteration in his patient’s health for the better, and pronounced her :not only out of danger, but able to get up.
We therefore left her to dreSs her-Self. When she was dressed, we came to her, and led her down stairs, countermanding the order for the post-chaife, paid the landlady liberally, and led her between us to a coach, which conveyed her Safe to her grandfather’s. When

What a family is this! How venerable
an old man ! how lovely a girl! They
both attend on my friend with the most
affiduous care, and shew their love for
him by their attention to me. The
Surgeon thinks it adviSeable I should not
fee him yet, as a Sudden SurpriSe may
be dangerous; I have therefore com-
plied with his deSire, and shall defer
vifiting him till he is Somewhat reco-
vered.
This lovely girl is the dear friend of
my Spanish relation; their unexpeSled
meeting was the pride anci boast of hu
man n uure; it was the meeting of Souls.
Mon.mia’s happineSs was indeed fortu-
nately alloyed, by fears for Lushington’s
health, or the rapture would have been
too exquiSite. This girl, if I mistake
not, is too much interested in his wel-

T was Lord Blagrave, wdth whom Lushington had been fighting. I was admitted to See him yesterday, and he inSormed me, that accidentally being in his company, and hearing him boast oS his amour, his indignation was rouSed, and calling him out, they fought. His wound is now out of danger, but his regiment is Sailed without him. That is not of much fignification, 1 believe, for Colonel Beverley Seems glad of it;

ELOISA DE CLAIRVILLE.
In 2 Vols^ \2mo. Price 6s*
This production is more a kin to the romance of the last century, than to the novel of the prefent day.
The fcene is laid in the court of Philip Augustus, king of France, a monarch who united with bravery and wifdom, every virtue and accomplifhment that could dignify a prince or adorn a man. The gallant manners of that brilliant court are agreeably defcribed, and that unhappy and fatal pastion of the lovely Eloifa de Clairville, is a tale that must awaken Sympathy in the bofom of every fon and daughter of Sympathy*
She never told her love,
But let concealment, like a worm Pthe bud,
Feed on her damafk cheek.

This ancient chronicle, like the tales of other times, is entertaining and interefling; it pretends not, however, to real antiquity, nor is it a fuccefsful imitation j modern refinements glare through the veil, and the political fpeculations of our reforming neighbours give a firikii>g hue to the whole. M. de Gorgy contrans the oppreflive with the benevolent lords, but gives the victory to the latter.

A tender little story, interesting but improbable. The author in the fecond volume approaches too near the Splendor of RoulSeau- not to appear in a disadvantageous fituation. ' The most pleastng pans of this novel were in our opinion the artlcfs picturefque descriptions of the habitations of the Alpine regions.

TALE o F T R U T H.
In 2 Vols- t9.ino Price JeweI
It may be a talc of truth, for it is not unnatural, and it is a tale of great diflreis. (stiarlotte, by the artifice of a teacher recommended to a School, from humanity, rather than aconvrction of her integrity, or the regularity of her former condudf, is inticed from her govc irefs, and accompanies a young offivei to America; the marriage ceremony, if not forgotten, is poitponed, and Charlotte dies a martyr to the inconstancy of her lover, and the treachery of his friend. The Situations are art-lefs and affecting; the deferiptions natural and pathetic. We Should feel for I’hailotte, iS fucK a perfon ever existed, who for one error, Scarcely, perhaps, deferved fo fe^ere a punistiment ; if it is a fiction, poetic justice is not, we think, properly distributed.
