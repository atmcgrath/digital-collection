Madam,
It would be doing injustice to the
taste and judgment of your Royal Highness, were I not to acknow-ledge, that the honor you are pleased to confer on this little Work,
is more a Favor granted to the situ-
ation of the Translator, than either bestowed on her merit, or that of the Performance; and this Favor, so little to be hoped for, is perhaps the only one that could have obliged her to give her Name to the Public.

DEDICATION.
DEDICATION.
It is recited of Your Royal High-ness's great Uncle, of astonishing memory, that one day, returning to the Castle of Brandenburgh, a child, of five years old, hung himself by his little hands to the neck of his Spur; and that his Majesty, making a sign to the officers around him not to disturb him; at the same time checking his horse, which seemed shy of so unusual an incumbrance, conducted the infant in silence and Safety up to the gates of the palace. Thus inoffensive, impotent, and ill-dressed, the Shepherdess of Aranville, probably originally the offspring of
necessity, and certainly now the re-production of a position no ways for-tunate,
dedication.
tunate, hangs herself at the feet of Your Royal Highness, in hopes of passing, in like manner, safely through the many dangers of neg-lect: or criticism, in consideration of the Illustrious Name which protects
her.
The Preservation, Honor, and Hap-pinefs of this Name, shall ever form
the most ardent Wish of,
Your Royal Highness's
Most obedient, and devoted
Humble Servant,

T HE
SHEPHERDESS
OF
ARANVILLE.
AT the foot of the mountains which se-parate France from Arragon, there lies a de-licious valley. The Vale of Aure is the name it bears: and this sweet name is less Soft than the hearts of its inhabitants. It forms a part of the country of Comminge; an illustrious name, but which presents to the imagination the idea of misfortune.
At the right of this Small district, at no great distance, lie the waters of Bagnieres those of Lucena, and the sources of the Ga-ronne. Here her waters are still pure, and those who inhabit her banks are loyal and
P
true,
( 2 )
true. To the west are the baths of Bareges, and the sources of the Adour: but these baths, fo much Sought after, are of no uSe to the inhabitants of these places. Health, peace, and gaiety have been transmitted to them from their ancestors; and these they hope their children shall possess when them-selves exist no longer. The frightful moun-tains, called Pic de Midi, separate them from the rest of France, the Pyrenees from the haughty Spaniard. Two passes alone con-duct to the last of those countries, the one bears likewise the name of Aure, the other, less agreeable, but shorter, is the pass of Venasques.
The vale oS Aure is watered by two Small rivers; the one is called the Neste. Her limpid water discovers the glittering sand which forms her bed. Rapid in her course, she offers the image of time as it flies, while more than one shepherdeSs, on the eve of a sine day, has mourned, on her banks,
	the
( 3	)
the Spring of her age, which had fled, Swift as the wave oS the rapid running Neste.
The river oS Rioumayour, though more confiderable, is flower in its courSe; and running at the Soot of the mountains,oSPortal, hid under the willows and alders, which Sorm an arch over its pallage, while more constant than the Neste, preSents its waters
leSs to the fight.
It is on the banks oS the Rioumayour, that the hamlet oS Aranville is situated. XheSe peaceSul abodes, inhabited by innocence, while they reSuSc the luxury of towns, offer all the happineSs of a country liSe. Every one is Surrounded by antique pines, which afford him shade. A rushing fountain, the preSent of a mountain to the South, ornaments the ground round their cabins, re-
Sreshes the inhabitants, and fertilizes their
/ ^
meads.
The people are rich, as they have no wants which they cannot easily Satisfy. Their rasto
B 2	is
(	4	)
is simple, and their desires are thoSe oS na-ture. Labour, which elSewhere is the afflic-tion oS men, forms here their greatest plea-Sure. At night the timid shepherdeSs longs for the dawn, to conduct her sheep to the banks oS the Rioumayour ; without a doubt the voice of her favourite shepherd had already been long heard in the vale. At their side the vigorous reaper collects the spoils, which the earth, in this place, never refuses to the happy cultivator. Joy presides over thefe works, which hope conducts ; the most pleasing of which last is to have a hat crowned with flowers, on the following day, by the hand of a favourite shepherdess ; for here the warmth of love penetrates all hearts.
One of these alone was ignorant of this law, which nature imposes on the feeling mind.
Louisa was her name; her age sixteen. Why can I not, with the fame exactness, describe her person ! Many shepherdesses
are
( 5 y
are called LouiSa, and many are only sixteen ; but none have the Sorm, nor the heart
oS LouiSa Montane.
The shepherds of Caffeau, oS Estenos, and oS St. Pre, ’all inhabitants of the valley oS Aure, had come to Aranville ; they had Seen LouiSa ; the eyes oSall were silled with her image, and none had dared to tell licr that she was beautiSul. Her name was repeated in all their Songs ; but as Soon as she appeared, that name was heard no longer, SaveSrom the Surroundino: echoes, Srom which it still reSounded. No one dared to deck' ^ his pasiion to her, as no one deemed himSeli wmrthy oS her. He who desired to flatter the object oS his wishes, told her that she reScmblcst LouiSa ; and she wifned it might be true.
Far Srom being vain oSher beauty, LouiSa
w'as ignorant that she poffeffcd it. Her Sa-ther was old and infirm ; leSs rich than his neighbours, becauSe his arms w'ere
B 3	leSs
(	6 j
Icfs robust. LouiSa Spared him the hardest
work; and when under the shade cfanold
linden, they partook oS the Srugal repast
which her delicate hands had prepared,
Montane bleffed God Sor having preferved his daughter to him.
Aranvilie was not the place of his birth. He came iiom the canton oSJBerne, and this name still warmed his heart, frozen by age. lor three hundred years, uninterruptedly, his ancestors nad laboured their native Soil, o. icrved in the w’ars, without cv'er havin<T^
N	O
courted the vile Savours oS the great. This vas the nobility oS which he was proud ; and if he repeated to nis daughter that Henry the Great had oSten visited their cottage of Ara-
iT.is, in the Valley of Bareton, his heart foft-cued, while he retraced the virtues and popularity of this good King. Some vexatious proceedings on the part of the chief men of his canton, together with the bitter remembrance of having been, deprived of a fon,
had
( 7	)
had made him quit Bern, and the banks of the Vert, for Aranvilie, and the shores of
the Rioumayour.
He had learned to pardon men for being unjust; and LouiSa conSoled him for the lofs of his fon. He felt a pleafure in instructing her in all that his age, and his experience had taught him. Sometimes he
related to her the wars which formerly defo-
»
latest France; the history of Henry the Great, his virtues, his tragical end,anst the
f
persecutions which afterwards afflicted thoSe who hast perSevered in the Protestant faith. At other times, he pictured to her the virtues and vices of the great; their morals, the • luxury and customs of the capital, whither his curiosity hast formerly led him. At all times he taught her to cherith her King, her country, and her duty. It was thus that his tensternefs centered in this beloved child,
4
rendered him happy, and Louifa was made So by the happinefs of her father.
Ba.	Each
(	8 j
Each hamlet of the valley of Aure, has its particular festival, which is renewed every time the honeyfucklebegins to flied anew its Sweet perfume. That of Aranvilie is the
p
most considerable; Louifa dwelt there: Could it be oiherwife ?
This day arrived : Soon as the morn be-
%
gan to appear, all the pastors of the vale V, ere collected there. Joy was painted on their faces; their hats, ornamented with flowers and ribbons, announced the sideliry and the gifts of their shepherdesses. With thefe were united Several of the young miciT ' of St. Licer, from Rieux, and Traimcfan-ges. Some had even quitted tire walls of Venafo lies, and the kingdom of Arratmn, for
X	'	O	4 }	^
the turf of Aranvilie.
The youth of the valley of Aure received tlicfe strangers with that fweet, eafy hofpi-
tality,. which is only to be met with in the country. They instructed them in their
Sports, informed them of their pleaSures,
their
('	9	)
their happinefs, and even the name and charms of their mistresses. But in the midst
'	I
of the eulogium given to beauty, thefe strangers continually heard them pronounce the name of Louifa.
She appeared at last, and was distinguiflied in the midst of her companions, like a lily among the other flowers of the meadows. They all went together, according to cuS-
tom, to return thanks;, to Providence, for having once more renewed the fpring with its Sweet.warmth. It. has been Said,.that Several shepherdesses forgot the gifts of nature, and only returned thanks that they were yet beloved by their shepherds.
Thefe last followed them to> the temple, taking care to place the strangers to advan^ tage.. The elegance of whofe cloathing, the good mein of fome of whom, and, above all, the singularity of feeing among them the inhabitants of towns, drew fora moment on-; them, the looks of all the shepherdesses,
B5	Don’
( 20 )
Don Juan de Pedrera, a young man fromi Venafques, deferved above all to be distinguished. Although he was a Spaniard, he
had ail that amiable foftnefs of manners which at that time belonged to the French. Eyes full of fenfe and fpirit, a fine countenance, with an eafy behaviour, announced the elevation of his birth i his foul was still more noble.
He had been particularly struck with the praifes they gave to Louifa ; he Saw her, and the foul of this Spaniard was wmunded profoundly. She was only an humble Shepherd-efs :, Pedrera knew-it; but rich, free, above prejudice, he would have esteemed himfelf happy to have been able to pleafe, and to deferve her.
The Sweet dreams of hope already occupied him, when the Snort ceremony, which drew the shepherds together, ended, in order to be followed by gaier occupations. The custom was, that each one conducted his
shepherdeSs
( II )
fliepheictcSs to the plain, where the rivalry of Songs, the contending games, and rural dances, to the Sound of the tabor, were to
enliven the remainder of the day.
Every one was anxious to shew reSpect to the strangers; it was Pedrera, whom they invited to chooSe the first shepherdeSs. He wdll chooSe LouiSa,” Said every one to him-Self; he alone is worthy of her; there is> only LouiSa who is worthy of this handfome. stranger ;’* and they ail thought right.
He advanced with that grace which cha--racterifes his nation, and prefented his hand,. trembling, to Louifa. Louifa accepted it without.blushing ; for it is only thofe who i
fear, or who desire, that are agitated.------
A Serene countenance is the mirror which . preSents to us the. portrait of a heart at eaSe. Their turn was of no long duration, and the * diScreet Spaniard had hardly time to expreSs; the pleafure.he enjoyed, in having followed;
B 6.,	the.j
t
(12 )■
the inclination he had felt, to assist at the festival of Aranvilie.
They were fucceeded by BelleSert, a young man from St. Licer, richly cloathed. He alone, of all the assistants^ thought that he shone by this appearance of luxury. Among this simple people it had, however, only
Served to procure him the fecond place. He
conducted with regret a shepherdeSs of Traimefanges. Louifa had alfo struck him.. He believed nothing was impossible for his gold to obtain j and he was devoured with jealoufy at feeing her with Pedrera.
The Sports began j Pedrera was in the sight of Louifa ; he was a Spaniard, and in love: it may easily be imagined whether he Spared his efforts to pleaSe, and to Succeed. He distinguished himSelf every where: In town he was an amiable gentleman, in the country the most perfect of all the shepherds. " What a pity,” Said an old maui
leaning
(	13	1
leaning against a poplar, which had beem hollowed out by fome centuries What 2b pity he' was not born among us!” As to BelleSert, he wanted to conceal his awk-wardneSs under cover of his pride ; he thought himfelf very great, and he was only very ridiculous.
Whilst LouiSa was reposing herSelf on the graSs,. he approached her with familiarity, and wanted to lead on a conversation, which she Supported with difficulty. Her heart was not prepoffeffed in favour of any one; ne--verthelefs, for the first time, fome one be-<
came odious to her; and this painful Sentiment had ariSen only with regard to-BelleSert. It is thus that blind prepossessions con-duct us, even when the motives which give birth to them remain as unknown to us as the influence they have over our fate.; BelleSert-; perceived he was not accepted; he. shivered^with pride and rage: too ardent to abandon his projects, he-Saw himSelf
obliged.
• ■ r-^
c 14 }
obliged to diflemble, promifing to himfelf
•	^4
either fuccefs or revenge.
The festival was to terminate by the distribution of the prizes, which the shepherdesses bestowed on thofe who had distinguished themSelves the most in the different crames they had played at. TheSe consisted in ribbons, Sometimes a Scarfi which the shepherds wore a long while to attest their victory.
All voices decreed the first prize to Pedrera. LouiSa, whom he had led forwaist, was to give it to him, in the name of her companions. The modest Spaniard put one knee to the ground; “Receive,” Said the shepherdeSs to him, " this slight prize oS our feast ; every Succeeding year will remind us that the Citizen of VenaSques honoured our country and our Sports.”—I receive your gifts with transports,” cried Pedrera, with vivacity;	happy if you receive my
heart in exchange. Amiable shepherdesses,,
it.
{ u )
it will ever remain among you; I always loved nature, how should I not admire the
finest of all her works!”
The Spectators perceived that this anSwer,
addressed in appearance to all the shepherdesses who crowned him, was meant Sor Louifa alone. Louifa only admired the Spaniard’s politenefs, and faw nothing more-Her manners were So simple, and her heart So innocent, that she did not even See her triumph. Coquets, alone, triumph, where
they are not conquered.
This day had decided the heart of Pedrera. Given up to the object of his tenderneSs, he Saw, he heard nothing but his shepherdeSs, and desired to live only to adore her. Timid and delicate in his passion, he hardly durst explain himSelf. LouiSa was infenfible; . and she who is So, Sar from returning the passion of her lover, does not even understand the language of his eyes.
Pedrera had a . Sarm at TraimeSanges.—
Traime-
( i6 )
Traimefanges is only three leagues fi'om Ve-naSquct, andTwo from Aranvilie. This pof-fefflon, which had beendong neglected, and which PedVera visited for the first time, became very foon the object of his care, and the end of all his rides. From thence he came Sometimes to Aranvilie; and when he had Seen LouiSa, he returned happy to: VenaSques:
One day, at last, he dared to Sound the heart of LouiSa. LouiSa esteemed him, but this cold Sentiment was all that he had to hope Sor. He Saw, and was afflidled at it; his visits became leSs Srequent, not that his
love had diminished, but becauSe hefeared to offend'hy his importunity.
While the festival at Aranvilie, and the occupations of its inhabitants, had banished i dulneSs from the valley of Aure, diScord,
1 borne on the impetuous wings of Aquilon,
1
blew her pestiferous rage into the hearts of
t
all the French. Thus.on the evening, of a
fine:
' >
r
(	17 )
fine day, the heavens are over-cast with thick clouds, the Sun is concealed in the shade, the thunder rolls, and, in a moment the earth has no other light than the pale lightning, more terrible than the niglit it-
Sclf.
Vvdiy must I interrupt the recital oS hap-pine.st, to join to it thoife of destruction and carnatre ? Can the hand which retraces the pleafures and Songs oS Snepherds, paint the transports oS ambition, and the Sury of revenge 1
if Sensibility Sometimes gives birth to our tears, hoDC SuDoorts us ; time or disiance
''1	i. i.	*
dry up their Source j and we find our happi-neSs, in feebng our iuisfortuncs anew.
What a distcrent picture! I now liave to retrace events already known ; I have to deScribe men intoxicated with Scenes oS blood, and thence led to the commission oS new crimes. TheSe evils were extended even to the preScnce of LouiSa. She alone,
and
( i8 3
and with difficulty, found means to repel their atrocious fury. Why can we not efface the remembrance of them from Suture ne-
*	O
ncrations ?
For a long while the French monarchy had fostered in Secret the destructive Seeds which were to conduct it to the brink of the precipice. Under the deceitful exterior of riches and power, fne was interiorly exhausted by this very magnificence and luxury, the perpetual objecfs of the desires and envy of her neighbours. Thus an oak, extending the inajeScic shade of its immenSe
X
branches over the Surrounding plain, while i: lavishes its fiip on the Superb foliage, the trunk dries up j the tree totters, falls, and cruSnes the astonished traveller j and the greater it is, the more the fall is terrible.
I he ambition of the great, the corruption of the rich, devouring luxury, productive of many wants, which are hardly Satisfied till new ones ariSc ; this thirst for gold, which
gold
(	19 )
gold still augments, and whofe poffeffion gives the unhappy power of committing crimes with impunity ; thefe evils had Separated the man from the citizen, and the citizen from his country. The cultivator bent towards the ground, watered the earth with thefweat of his brow; and, if he dared
X
to lift his eyes to Heaven, it was to offer them heavy with tears.
The Magistrate purchaSed the right of being just:, and Sold injustice. Gold was exacted from him who had it not: The powerful added it to his wealth; and-in the midst of thefe heaps of gold, pressed from
I
the people, the state had not wherewithal to
Supply its exigencies.
One of thofe gifts which nature grants fo rarely to empires, a minister of integrity, by turns driven out becaufe he was just and true, and recalled becaufe he was
necessary, dared to found the abyfs, and indicate
' (■ 20 )'
dicate it to his Sovereign. His King was weak, but he w’as good, and he wished to
hear the voice of his people. His Subjects were assembled Srom the most distant parts of all the provinces ; and this voice. So importunate to Sovereigns, would have recalled the public happineSs, iS thoSe who bore It had listened to that of moderation.
The weakneSs of the King made his virtues be called in question, while the pride of power intoxicated thofe whom long Suffering had irritated ; distrust got possession of the minds of the people, and its conductors blinded them, to raife their own authority on what was become odious to them. A Superb, but defective palace was destroyed, and the French wander still at
jandom, in the labyriiith of ruined materials.
Fame, that terrible voice, which magnifies and disfigures events, the farther she
is
( 21 } '
is heard from the place of their birth, had
*
already traverfed sixteen provinces, to bring this news to the valley of Aure.
Were she to be credited, happineSs was to be born anew, becauSe one of the instruments of tyranny had been demolished. In order to render this happy liberty permanent, every Frenchman, armed with death-difpenfing tubes of iron, was to watch the door of his cottage. Blood hadfflowed, but it was the impure blood of the Ministers of tyranny. It was still destined to flow; every great man merited death, for his title was a crime. Flight was forbid, and orders were given for murder.
St. Licer, Rieux, Pamiers, TaraScon, were already filled with thefe reports. The young men, full of sire, had taken arms ; Some animated with the dcfire of defending liberty, others with' the pride of com-mand, and the rage to destroy.
I
BelleSert was of the number of thefe lash
For
( 22 )
For a long w hile he had in vain endeavoured to employ his gold to purchafe thofe titles oS honour which are attached to the descendants of thoSe who have deServed well from their country. More happy, he now commanded, in the neighbourhood of his
r
town, the destruostion of thofe, whoSe station he had not been able to deServe.
What he was most ambitious of was, to appear in the eyes of I.ouiSa, with all the Splendour of his authority, not doubting that she would easily be overcome by it.
This project appeared eafy to him. The limits that his vanity had Set to his desire of command, contained the valley of Aure within its boundary. This people were yet mild, peaceful, and without arms; it was requisite to render them fierce, and to put the Sword into their hands.
It was in order to execute this double project, that BelleSert, after having assembled the choice men of his battalion, quitted
I	St.
(	23	)
St. Licer, clears the mountains which Surround FronSac, penetrates into the valley,and having crossed the Rioumayour, bore the alarrn into Estenos, Mauleon and Casseaii, ordering the inhabitants, as Soon as day appeared to assemble in the plain of Aranvilie.
In the mean while Aranvilie enjoyed the peace of innocence; night had just covered it with her thick veil, and the fparkling stars announced another fine day to fucceed the past one.
The.old Montane, and his daughter enjoyed the fweet steep of virtue. Pedrera alone was awake, and even directed his steps on the side where Aranvilie lay. Con-fufed notices of the troubles in the capital, and in the provinces, had awakened hisdiS-quiet for his dear LouiSa, and the place she inhabited. To dissipate thefe apprehen-. sions ; to fee her, animated without doubt, with the hope of one day Softening her heart,
he approached the hut of old Montane,
guided
( H >
guided by love, and without being impeded by the night.—She offered him the Sweet facility of being able at pleafure to visit the places which had first given birth to his love. There lay the plain, -where the hand of his shepherdeSs had crowned him; here he beheld the shepherds keep silence, and
the birds ceaSe their warbling, to listen to the enchanting Sound of her voice. He -laid himSelf down at the foot of the pine-tree, where Louifa had repofed. Thefe delicious recollections, fo dear to the lover, re-animated his heart with a new fire. He approaches the window of Louifa, there, hid in the shade, which was reflected by the moon-light from an old linden, he dared,
with a trembling voice, to utter a Spanish
*
ballad, depictive of the flames which con-fumed him.
LouiSa, Softly awakened by theSe Sounds, 4-ecognized sthe citizen of Venafques; the
f
accents struck her ear, but they did not pe-
4	netrate
(	25	)
penetrate to her heart; she sighed, neverthc-lefs, at being the occasion of pains which she could not relieve. LouiSa loved Pedrera as she would have loved a brother; every other Sentiment was unknown to heri but this is a weak conSolation to a lover. TheSe pain Sul refledtions banished Sleep Srom the eyes of Louifa, while Pedrera, wandei--ing round her habitation, waited till the rising day flaould prefent to his eager looks, the features of his mistrefs.
Aurora appeared at last ; and old Montane, who had preceded it, gave to his daughter the kifs of peace, and the benediction of a father. « Come,” faid he, to her, let us go and admire nature: This plealure, fo pure, fo true, is only known to us. The most precious homage vhich man can ender to his Creator, is a lively fenfe of his favours.” And conducting Louifa by the hand, he led her to the foot of the liii-
C	den,
;
'( 2 6 )
den, which the fun began now just to gild with his rays.
Thou feest this brilliant star, which has just enlightened our plain; to-morrow he will re-commence his career. Man is fub-ject toother laws; the evening of his life does not offer to him the image of another
day. Thou feest my hairs whitened by age :
<
it is the show which announces the winter in covering our mountains. I have attained my winter; and the warmth of a new fpring never fuccecded for man, to the frosts with which old age.penetrates his veins. LouiSa, let not thy eyes be filled with vain tears, this is neither the example nor the leffon, which I have given thee. Ought we to be afflicted
to behold the yellow and withered leaves
%
of autumn fall, and become the fport of the winds, to give place for the verdant branches of the month of May ? His the image of men, who fucceed to each other.
I shall
( 27 )
V
1 shall Soon have finished my courSe,
)
and I beheld its period without fear, and without regret. Thou hadil a brother ; for
a moment fortunecardSed him ; a rnomen^ was fufficient to tear him fio;n our hopes; and the name of thy father will very foon exist only in the remembrance of his daughter. Thyfelf, Louifa, very fogn left alone, without Support, like the jessamine of our mountains, vhich the wind twists round at pleafure, wilt thou be able, in the age of the passions, to resist their attraction ? Let rather the heart of thy father direct thee, while he is yet able. Wouldst thou fear to open thine heart to him ? Thou mayest
chufe among the shepherds who inhabit thefe countries: many of them are worthy of thee, and my only wish is to fee thee happy. But if an inhabitant of the towns were to Seduce thy innocence; if thy heart were
S
prepoffeffed in their favour, grief would Still
C 2	abridge
( 28 )
abiiOge this evening of my hfe. Pedrera loves thee; 1 doubt it no longer i his stay licre, ms visits^ his looks, his converfa-tion, had created in nie fome doubts; this night again his Songs have reSounded in my eais, and have augmented my fears.—■ hat I oread in him is, this appearance of virtue ; mis sincerity w’hich he affects in his
difcourfc; tnis noblenefs in his actions. He
loves thee; 1 have not been able to hinder myfelf even from loving him ; and this af-tcndancy which he has taken over me, makes me tremble for my Louifa. Think that he is lich, of an illustrious family ; his desiies can then only be dcceitfuf and his difeourfes Snares laid for virtue.
Louifa embraced her father, while she af-Sured hint that her heart was at eafe. Her lips had never yet been fullied by a falfe-hood ; Montane believed her, and tranquillity rc-animated his strength.
The
(	29	}
She fun had defcended from the Summit of th'e mountains, and gilded the buttorn of the valley. Louifa was going to con-
duct her flock to the banks of the Rioumayour, and the old Montane was tying up with reeds the trailing vines, when the battalion of St. Licer appeared in the plain.
Their number, the brilliancy of their arms, the three ribbons which decorated their coats, formed a new and ftrange fight in the valley. Montane and his daughter could not believe their eyes. The inhabitants of Aranvilie collect around them;
%
they mutually interrogate .each other, and no one-can explain the mystery.
The column approaches, and very Soon they know the haughty BelleSert, who commands it. Vigaron and Cabanac are at his side. Behind them stand the young men of St. Licer, of Bertrand, and from the neighbourhood, who strew their inexperience
C3 .	in
(	3°	)
s
in bearing arms. Frightful sh’outs proceed from the centre of the column ; the cries of a mad desire of blood and pillage. The heads of thofe who utter them are feen above the column. A fierce look, dishevelled hair, a liaggard countenance, a neck, arms, and legs bare, offer to view a black and burnt floin, with mufcles of iron. The title of robbers is that with which they honour themSelves.
The Snepherds of the neighbouring hamlets arrive bv other roads. Re-united to thofe of Aranvillei they throng round Montane, for Montane was always their coun-fellor and their guide. Louifa, astonished and trembling with fear, furrounded on all sides, cannot attain to her cottage. Two of her companions, attracted by their curiosity, fee her embarraffment; and Pedrera, brought back by this sight from the banks of the Neste, whither his amorous reverie
had
r 31 )'
had drawn him, Seconds theSe shepherdeSfcs, —attains to LouiSa—places himSelf at her side, and encourages her.
.Duriiigthis period of time BelleSert commands his troop to extend themSelves, and* from his horSe, addreffes the attentive shepherds. ,
Frenchmen,” faid he to them, 1 come to announce to you your deliverance and happinefs. You know, that for more than a century, the hydra of tyranny has been fattening himSelf with the blood of the people whom he Iwd devoured. E'.en your perlons were become a fport to the caprice of the great; and of the name of Franks which we bear, there only remained to us
the bitter reflection of having lost that liberty of which this word offers the idea to our minds. Our reprefentatives affembled, wanted to. recal equality, to retrace to man his rights, and to restore them to him. Shall

Shall I relate it to you ? At hearing this virtuous pioject, the menaces of thepowerful, who oppreSs you, bi'oke Sorth. They had conceived a destructive project. Soldiers, GoIis_osted near the walls of the capital, threatened it; languinary orders were going to destroy it, and even the name of your defenders would have been effaced in the toiients of their blood, which was destined to have been flied. The genius of France has watched over us; thefe dark plots have been difcov'ered ; the minds of all men are enlightened; the foldier is become a citizen, tne citizen is become a foldier. One day has been Sufficient to break chains which had cost ages to Sorge ; the idol of power is fallen; dungeons have been opened, destroyed, and levelled with the ground; and this great day, ever memorable, shall render
the courage of the French for ever illustri-
)
ous. The capital has given the example,
and
( u3 )
and all the provinces have followed it tvith ardour, But that is not cnoup^h: this monster wishes to revive ; the great lay plots, and the nobility only look upon
us as rebels. Tremble, men of France, tnat thefe nobies do not shed in us their blood which we have shed.- — Every Frenchman ougnt to be fi'ce j he ouo"ht
O
to arm himfelf; thefe castles, thefe palaces, which our stupid ignorance admired, which our imbecility refpected, thefe revered monuments of genius and of the arts, are the afylums of tyrants, which she ought to destroy; death is the just reward of their possessors. Behold this troop which follows me; the sire of ii-^ berty isctn their looks; their hands are already accustomed to war. Montasset, Mauvesin, Mestelabert, are nothing now but, a heap of ruins; sire has destroyed every thing, and steel has avenged the
citizens.	C 5	And
(	34	}
And you, tranquil as in the midst of peace, you have done nothing yet, for liberty or for your country. We pardon your ignorance, but let your zeal repair your tardinefs. Here are arms; they will ferve you to destroy tyranny. All thofe wsho bear the name of noble; all thofe who want to conduct us in the name of God or of the King, merit the name of tyrants. They ought to be Spoiled, covered with infamy; nor is their blood pure enough to merit our !' regret. The ties of blood and of ft rend-ship ought to be broken. SKc are the children of our country alone, and she only has a " "^ht to our obedience. Hinder, above all things, the flight of our enemies, and let the fmoaking castles of our province. Serve as trophies to your vengeance; for, I repeat it to you, the
French are free i and, far from being punished.
( 35	)
niSncd, a thouSand voices shall celebrate the heroic deeds which I command you to perform.”
He was silent, and a thouSand different opinions were heard among the inhabitants of the valley.
The Sweet Sound of liberty had moved all hearts, and warmed all their courage; but the idea of destruostion and of carnage came Soon, to darken this delicious picture. Some, contented with their lot, were desirous only of peace; others beheld, in Bellefert’s difeourSe, a falSe re-prefentation of events, of which they must await a more certain account, in order to determine. Shall I own it ? Others there were who, animated with the fame demon, which had infpired BelleSert, burnt with the desire of following his traces. Montane, with his eyes fixed on the ground, kept a profound silence. All
C 6	at
y
(	3^	)
at last addreffed themSelves to him, as to a
!
man who ought to anSvver Sor them, and v hoSe opinion they Swore to follow.
Montane heard them without proffering a single word. He yields at last to their redoubled importunities; rifes Slowly, Supported on one side by a knotted stick, and aided on the other by Pedrera, he addreffed himSelf to the battalion of St;' Licer in theSe words :
h
“ Young men, you Say you are conducted by the love of your country, and a zeal Sor liberty. We believe it j can the .
J
hearts of the French be animated by other motives ? But you Speak to us of oppression, of plots, of bloodshed, of men to punish, of revenge. Has, not the zeal which animates your hearts misted your under-
I	'
standing ? — Consider thefe mountains, which encircle our valley; the inhabitants they contain in their circuit have
4	always
$
#
( 37	)
always been free. Submissive to the laws, and faithful to the Monarch of the French. If your towns are enslaved, it is becauSc their inhabitants contended for the bonds with which they desired to be chained. It is true that wicked men have Sometimes deceived the confidence of our good King, and abuSed his authority. Injustices have been committed, even un-der shelter of the laws which forbid them • but becauSe clouds Sometimes darken the Sun, wmuld you withdraw from its benign influence ? Consider the earth: it is governed by laws which recal the Seasons, and preserve its fertility; if a storm wastes our fields, or if at one time sterility Spreads itfelf on our grounds, shall we abandon our meadows, and shall we riSe
I
to oppoSe the laws of nature ? It is the Same with all governments j let us be re-signed to its evils, and let us rejoice in
its
A
( dS )
ks favours. Would you wish to change it?—Will your’s be perfect? And if we must change one evil for another, and one abuSe against another abufe, it is better to remain fubject to thofe whofe force has been destroyed by habit, than with much pain to procure others. As- to the plots of which you Speak, without doubt, by abusing your youth they have SurpriSed your credulity. Plots ! Does a father make any against his children ? Does the labourer destroy the cottage in which he repofes ? You fay the citizen has broken his bonds, and destroyed his tyrants : May the innocent never have been confounded with the guilty !—But if, like us, you are Sree, if all France is animated with the fame Spirit, why thefe threatening arms ? Why this appearance of war ?—You wish that all men should be free f that property should be assured
to
( 39	)
to all; and you want to oppreSsuhe citizens at your will, and to destroy his property ! Be consistent with yourfelves, and do not, at least, be more unjust than
the great, whom you detest.
Are we called on to repel the enemies of the kingdom ? To defend our King, habitations, our altars, religion, virtue ? You have only to command, we are ready to quit thefe places, and to fly wherever there is any danger ; but if we must arm ourSelves against our brothers ! against the citizens I against the French ! you must not depend on us: we love peace, and
we detest revenge.”
ft
All the shepherds applauded the Speech of Montane; Louifa rejoiced to See peace triumphant; whilst a threatening mur-
0;
mur was heard from the midst of the battalion. BelleSert dissembled his rage, and,
penetrating into the midst of the ranks,
gave
(	40	}
. \
gave Secret orders, and very foon the val-
»
ley was rid of the weight of arms and of thofe who bore them.
BelleSert was the only one of them who remained in Aranvilie. He had observed Pedrera conversing with LouiSa, and he doubted not that they understood each other; and he even SuSpected the first of having come to inSpire the inhabitants of the valley with Sentiments which were not patriotic, for So he
termed them ; that is to fay, which were not correfpondent with his desires. He faw himfelf repulfed in his love, and disappointed in his ambitious designs; which, however,, only gathered new strength from thence. His last project, that upon which he determined was, to declare himfelf fully, and either to fucceed or to be revenged. Master of his troops he had ordered them to retire
certain
( 4t )
\
certain of being able to recal them, more
furious than ever, as foon as he wished for it.
Xhessun rendered the heat inSupport-able; and the crowd which were affembled, had began to diSperfe, ; BelleSert approached Montane and LouiSa ; and, composing his countenance and his voice,
he ashed leave to fliare the shade with
«
them, and their repast. I shall be able,” added he, to convince you of the purity of our intentions, and the necessity of our steps.'-’ Montane Smiled, and conducting BelleSert to the side of the pure spring which ran near his cottage, he made him sit down on the Sresh
giaSs, and recommended to LouiSa to
regale her guest.
While she prepared their Srugal dinner, BelleSert represented to old Montane, with the most lively colours, the abuSes
of
(	42	}
of deSpotifm ; the long-fuffcrings of the people; the multiplicity of the taxes; the crying oppressions of the great,, and the necdsity of compleating the revolution vshich was begun.
Montane ackno pledged thefe evils ; but difapproved tiie violent means which they had made ufe of to destroy them. ‘‘ Believe me,” replied Bellefert, “ if thefe injustices had more immediately fallen upon you, you would have been the first to have invoked vengeance on their perpetrators.”
Very well,”' faid, at last, Montanc;, you fliall judge. You will fee if any one had more reafon than I have to detest them. I had one fon; he loved glory, but accompanied by virtue. ‘ Permit me,’ faid he to me, one day, ^ to go to ferve my country and Louis ; I shall Spend my blood, or return worthy of you :
Sor,
%
(	43	)
for I Suall imitate you.’ I embraced
him, and he went away. The news I
*
received from him conSoled me Sor his abSence. He distinguished himSelt, was . promoted, and I rejoiced. His commander was his friend, and carried him with him to the capital. My fon faw one of his relations ; he loved her ; and thefe monsters affassinatecl him, becauSe a title did not embarrafs his name.”
And you still love them ! ” Said Eellefert.
No faid Montane ; but between two evils 1 chuSe the least. The King would have heard us; he would have been just; and, if he was a tyrant, in place of one, a multitude is going to devour us. Consider the frightful Con-Sequences of anarchy ; a civil war, the most cruel of all wars, which she drags
always in her train. You boast of castles
destroyed i
ft
f
(	44	)
destroyed; of nobles flaughtcred; the
law's are then without force, or they exist no longer; and, remember, it is better to have defective ones than not to have any. From the moment that licen-tioufncfs t3.kcs the nRiiic of liberty thsit sliC dares to find, under shelter of this tide, the impunity of her crimes, she has no longer any bridle; and to-morrow thofe will groan in their turn, who ' have ma le an abufe of it to-day.”
Louisti interrupted this converfation ;
the rears ran from her eyes, for she had heard the name of her brother.
•-^nd you, amiable siiepherdels !** faid BelleSert, addressing himfelf to her,
do you alsh blame men who are free, for avenging him for whom you weep ?” Without a doubt S’ faid the shep-herdefs ; « revenge doubles our calamities; it is always uSeleSs and cruel. May
thofe
( 45	)
thofe who made my brother perish, lament their victim, as I have done his death ! it will then be expiated.” Bellefert, confounded, durst; insist no -longer ; and. Such is the impression which beauty caufes on our hearts, that its touching language had nearly Testored him to virtue.
A Simple, but well-tasted repast, awaited Montane and Bellefert. They fat down in silence, and LouiSa Sought to hide her tears; but her labouring breast could hardly stisie her Sobs.
BelleSert, diSconcerted rather than intimidated, tried to conSole her. He
9
knew not that the conSolation of the man who is importunate only aggravates our Susterings; and Louila very Soon retired. She went alone, to weep the
oeath oS h^r brother, and .her country torn to pieces.
Grown
(	4^	)
Crown holder by her abSence, Belle-Seit imagined that he might mo--'e by ambition, him whom a desire of vengeance had not been able to conquer. He reprefentoct to Montane his country, crowning with its considence, thofe who Sliould facrisice themfelves for her; and,, entering into a detail of the strange jumble cf the new order of things, he indicated to him the places which would rccompence his zeal.
Montane, in place of an anSwer, uncovered his white hairs, and shewed him the earth, wshere they should very Soon be deposited.
Be it So,” Said BelleSert; but LouiSa, this child So beloved, made to
be adored by all thoSe who See her, do
you count it nothing to prepare Sor her
a lot worthy of her ? Who among us
would not esteem himfelf happy to offer himfelf to her?” .. .
“ Hold,
\-
T 47	)
“ Hold !” faid Montane, carried away by his indignation, ‘‘whoever loves virtue is worthy of Louifa ; the hands which are stained with blood, shall not long profane her sight.”
This anSwer cut BeleSert through, as the axe, in the hand of thb woodman, the pine destined to fall under his strokes. He was silent, and meditated revenge. Having bid adieu to Montane, he rejoined his men, who were waiting for him at the bridge of Sales. It was there that, having represented to them the affront they had just received, from the inhabitants of the valley, by their refufal to join them, he wanted to engage them to carry destruction to their abodes.
His people were deaf to his voice, as they were to that of honour, and -of their country. They had been told, that the castle of, Pontac remained to
be
( 48 )
/
be destroyed, and that they would find gold there. Happily there was none at Aranvilie. They marched then to hontac, aster having placed Spies and guards at all the pastes.
Meanwhile Pedrera related to the shepherds of Aranvilie, the news he had heard from the capital and from the provinces. Pedrera was a Spaniard. He placed honor in his fidelity to his Sovereign. His fpeech carried all Suffrages ; a fecond time it was decided
that they should not change their peace-
\
Sul crooks, for the instruments of slaughter and of death.
T1 lis refolution dried up the tears of LouiSa. Pedrera perceived it; and
this triumph of his eloquence was the
•>
finest moment of his life. His hopes encreafed; and where is the lover who would not flatter himSelf with moving
the
.	t
(	49	)
»
the heart of a shepherdeSs, whoSe griefs he had SoStened }------LouiSa, recollect-
ing the diScourSe of her father, thought she difcovered in herfclf an emotion of gratitude which was too tender; fear made her cheeks grow pale; and it was
not till after Sue had confulted herfelf
»
on her real Sentiments, that gaiety restored her charms to her. Pedrera, happy in his error, returned to VenaSques; but his heart remained'at Aranvilie, and the image of LouiSa accompanied him everywhere.
The valley enjoyed peace anew, and very Soon the rapid events of the day
4
appeared but as the traces of a painful dream, which were effaced by awaking.
On the banks of the Rioumayour, not far from Aranvilie, there rifes a forest,
covered with old pines. There the jeS-Samine, the honeySuckle, and the modest
D	eglantine.
(	50	)
eglantine, interwoven, contend for the prize of their perfume, and the fplen-dor of their colours. At the center of th is forest issues, from the foot of an old willow, a fpring, famous for the purity of its waters, and for the miraculous virtues which are attributed to it. Its borders are ornamented with a thoufand kinds of flowers, to which it gives birth ; the Sweet murmurs of its waters, mixed with the Songs of the nightingale, perched on the hawthorn-tree, which shades it, have obtained for it the name it still bears, “ the Shep-herdefs Fountain.” The Rioumayour winds here, in order to receive it in his breast, and to encircle almost the whole forest in his courSe. At a diS-tance are preSented to view the naked
and barren rocks of Gafpet. They form a part of Pic de Midi, and Separate
(	51	)
rate the valley of Aure, from the forest of Bonrepos, and the fields of the
unfortunate La Peyroufe,
The narrow and dangerous roads which traverfe thefe mountains, are rarely passed, lave by the intrepid hunter, or the amorous shepherd. On the Southern sido^ the Sertile hills of Traimefan^i'es shew themfelves, overlooked by the mountains of Arragon. A narrow path, where the grafs is hardly pressed by
the feet of the shepherdesses, is the only one which conducts to this delicious fountain. It was here that Louifa uSed to conduct her flock, during the heat of the day, to the shade of a beech, whilst she herfelf. Seated at the feet of the willow, from whence the fpring eScapes, arranges the flowers gathered by her hands. When the Sun no longer gilds. Save the Summit of the
H2	Pic
{	52 )
Pic de Midi, the shepherdeSs brings back her flock to the plain, where the Neste mixes its waters with the Rioumayour ; and there, in the midst of the willows, which shelter their forms, the voice of Louifa pleafes itfelf to
make the echoes repeat the ancient fongs of the canton of Berne ; still they are heard, when the fun, wrapt up in her Sable mantle, obliges her to bring back her sheep to her cabin of Aranvilie. The following day renewed the Same occupations, and the Same pleasures ; nor ever did weary dulneSs inhabit thefe abodes, or make the day Seem too long.
Louifa was quite given up to thefe favourite occupations, yet she could not
forget the Scenes she had been witneSs to, in the midst of theSe verdant meadows i still it Seemed to her that she
Saw
(S3 )
Saw the threatening arms of Bellefert; and the noiSc of the waters of the Rioumayour recalled to her imagination the barbarous cries of thefe robbers.
This recollection was every day made
»
stronger, by the news which arrived from all sides. The castles of the provinces destroyed, and their poffessTors put to death, wherever a fpeedy flight had not Saved them; and that the citizens, armed, had permitted or faintly resisted thefe excesses, when they them-fel ves did not commit them.
The great efcaped from the capital, and all the noble fugitives, from their castles, fought to gel out of their country. Some among them had even penetrated into Spain, by the road of Bareges, and the passes of Pau, and of Lavedan. It was from thofe that they were informed of
the violence done to the King, of
D 3	his
(	54 )
his captivity in Paris; and the malTacre of his guards. Other Gentlemen, leSs happy, had been arrested; and now thefe roads, as well as the passes of Aure and Venafquct, being carefully guarded, rendered flight impossible.
Thefe events were the Subject of long conversations among the inhabitants of the valley. When their labors were ended, before the door of old Montane, they listened in silence to the account which he gave to them of the beginning of monarchy; the rights of the people, and the obligations of their Sovereigns. He painted to them the ancient attachment of the French nation to their Kings, and the efforts made, in all ages, to deStroy theSe bonds of union, which form the glory of the King, and the happinefs of the people. LouiSa devoured theSe words; and her heart, alternately
(	55 )
ternatcly agitated between hope and fear, mourned for all the infults with which they outraged their Sovereign. One of her companions brought, one day to her, the Bernois shng, made on the captivity of this good Monarch. While she listened to it her tears fell in abundance, and, from that time Sorward, thefe Sad founds were repeated, without ceasing, on the banks of the Neste, and Rioumay-
Louifa had gone one morning, earlier than ufual, to the Shepherueffes Fountain. Her dog, the faithful Zephyr, a name which his lightnefs in the chace
had obtained for him, lav at her side. H is pensive mistrefs retraced to her mind the evils with which men afflicted one another. “Why are they not all happy 1** faid fne to herfelf. “ Ought they not all to love one another as 1 love my compa-
D 4	nions ?
(	56	}
panions ? What a frightful pleafure that of Slaughtering our fellow-creatures! If Sometimes the devouring vulture and the timid dove offer themSelves to my eyes, my heart is torn aSunder; and men, whofe portion ought to be mild-neSs, it is they themSelves who Sacrifice each other to their ambition! Suddenly reflecting on the destiny of this King, whoSe fate was the object, a few years ago, of the desires of the most powerful Monarchs in Europe ; her heart could not refufe itfelf the idea of repeating once more this charming’ ballad, which paints So well to us the virtues
A
and the troubles of this grandSon of
1 leirry.
(
She had hardly recited the first verSe, when her favorite Zephyr starting up Suddenly, made the Sounds of his silver voice be heard. Never had this little companion
I
/
(	57 )
4
companion of her walks been^ heard in vain. Louifa, astonished, stops, rifes, and, turning her eyes towards the side
>
of the forest, tried to diScover the Subject of his clamors.
Two strangers piercing, through the thicket, offer themfelves at last to her view. She beheld them approach with difficulty ; fadnefs feemed painted in] their countenance; their eyes wandered with difquiet on all the objects which fur-rounded them ; and, from their tottering step, it might easily be perceived, that their delicate feet had been hurt with fatigue.
The first was a young man, about twenty years of age. A mixture of
%
pride and rhildnels covered his coun-
9 f
ctenance. H(is hair, of the Softest tint, fell in dishrdcr over his shoulders. A lilk coat, and laced linen, torn, announced
D 5	mil
I
( 58 ]
still IcSs than the graces of his figure, his birth and misfortunes. Louifa, in Seeing him, believed she beheld the god who is Sung by the shepherdesses. To her he was one. He conducted by the hand a lady, still younger than himSelf; fair as Aurora, but whofe charms clouded with grief, discovered the profound melancholy with which she was devoured.
Louila, whom an involuntary emotion of terror had led to go away, reproached herSelf for fo doing. The air of theSe strangers, the misfortunes which, without doubt, had led them to theSe places, more than this, the irresistible aScen-dency which thoSe take over our hearts, who are made to pleaSe us, had inSpired Louifa with the most tender Sentiments for theSe two unfortunate fugitives, when she was accosted by them.
Amiable
(	59 )
" Amiable shepherdeSs,” Said the stranger, with one of thoSe Soft Sonorous voices which perSuade while they attach us, “ may we afk if this place is still far distant from the frontiers of Arraaon: and where are the passes which will
conduct us thither? Without a doubt' my question will create fufpicions, which we ought to efface; but we dare to believe that we Snail have no reafon to repent yielding to the confidence with which you inlpire us.’’
Noble strangers-,” replied the shepherdeSs, " I understand your distresses,, and your projects ; I pity you, and would wish to ferve you. But how can 1 ? My feet have never quitted this valley.— They have indeed told me, that at half a day ’s journey from hence, this mountain, which you See over-top the others. Separates us from VenaScjues; but they Say
L 6	that
( 6o )
/
that its narrow passage is guarded. If
my advice should lead you into a Snare, Satal to your lives, judge if I should not die with delpair. Come with me to our cottage: My father is old, but he is well- instructed ; he w'ill give you his counSels, you will take fome repoSe, and Heaven will do the rest.”
I doubt it no longer, since I have found an angel, in the midst of the tigers who persecute us,” cried the stranger, pressing with transliort one of Louifa’s hands, who fiintly resisted. You are
fo good as to interest yourfelf for us then ! Ah, it is worthy of beauty to assist misfortune! I own it to you, overwhelmed by fatigue and want, and beholding in all men only executioners,
%
Seeking to kill us, we hid ourSelves in this forest, uncertain what should become of us I desire death ; I still implore
it;
/
( 6i )
' t
it; but how ban I abandon this beloved sister, whom I accompany, already So unfortunate, and who has only been Saved by a miracle from the hands which pur-Sue us ? In the midst of thefe overwhelming reflections, accents have struck our ears. Fair shepherdeSs, it was the Sound of your voice which penetrated
my heart: I faid to my sister, this voice is that of a shepherdeSs; their manners are Soft and simple; let us venture to discover ourSelves; she will never be So baSe as to betray our confidence. My sister yet hesitated ; and I heard you already deploring the Sorrow of our good master. Let us fly,"’ Said I to her; her voice pities our King; will she
refufe to hear his faithful Servants ? I did
»
well to believe my heart. I am almost conSoled already.—But Say, thou tutelary angel oS theSe countries, does your father
reSemble
%
( 62 )
reSemble yon?—Pardon my SuSpicions; Man, overwhelmed with evil, is ready to become unjust.”
If you had anything to fear from my father,” faid Louifa, 1 Snould conceal you from his sight. Take courage i my Sentiments are thofe with which he has infpired me ; and he has this advantage over me, the prudence which accompanies years. But I believe that you are very much fatigued; it is a great way to our cottage, the fun is not yet down, and perhaps it is of importance that you .should not be Seen. Stay here, near this fountain; nobody comes hither at this hour. I shall go to Seek my father : I will bring you Some fruit, the only food of our climate; You and my father will confult on the road you ought to take.”
Alas, LouiSa pronounced theSe last
words
f 63	)
words with pain; she was ignorant that her heart was wounded ; and the painful idea of abScnce, and of distance, and of the strangers going away, afflicted her already.
i
We abandon ourSelves to your generous care,” Said the stranger, " provided you promise to us that we shall See
\
you with your father.”
Louifa affures them that he w'ill not come without her; and with a nimble foot she ran, without stopping, to their cottage at Aranvilie. She very foon related to her father the fubj ect which
#
brought her. She was longer in painting the strangers; her eulogiums of their air, their converfation, the recital of their misfortune, never finished. She believed that the compassion she wished to inSpire in their favour, was the motive of her diScourSe j but it was dictated
( 64 )
tated by the pleafure one feels in discoursing of what one loves.
Montane had never denied him-
W
Self the delicious fenfation of doing good; and misfortune had, above all, claims in his eyes, which nothing could
annihilate.
‘‘Thefe strangers,” Said he to Louifa, “ are perSecuted; it is not for us to decide, whether or not they are guilty; our duty is to assist them. Woe to the hard heart, which, in order to be So without remorfe, meafures its favours by the actions of thofe who Solicit.— To be julf, he begins by being cruel. Let us be beneficent. Remember, my daughter, that this is the only virtue of which one never repents.”
LouiSa embraced her father: tears of joy eScaped from her eyes, and never had virtue enjoyed So much the pleafure of do-ing good.	Excellent
{ H )
Excellent milk, fresh bread, velvet peaches, gathered fresh Srom the tree, which shaded the window of Louifa, oranges, the production of the country, were very foon shut up in a bashet of white ozier which she had woven on the banks of the Neste, and in which she uSed to bring refreshments to her father, when he was occupied with the painful labors of agriculture. LouiSa. covered it with a cloth, whiter than the Snow on Pic de Midi; and, having
taken the bafket on her arm, she conducted old Montane to the Shepherd’s Fountain.
“ Here is my father,’* Said LouiSa to the strangers, while she emptied her bashet on the graSs; “ he loves you al-« ready: but, before we Speak of busineSs, taste the fruits of our mountains. It is little, compared to the food of your
towns;
{ 66 )
towns; if we could, we should have offered that to you with as good will. Old Montane made the strangers sit down, who had riSen at his approach. He placed himfelf by the young man, whilst his daughter, near the fair stranger, engaged her, by the fweetest caresses, to take fome food, and to diS-• sipate her melancholy.
Exhausted equally by fatigue, fear, and a devouring hunger, our strangers very Soon reSumed their strength and Spirits. The dark cloud of deSpair which covered the face of the young man, foon made place for a more chear-ful countenance; and a Sweet Smile began already to play on his lips.— His sister, tho jgh leSs afflicted, retained an air of I nguor, which appeared lest the effect ot the preSent circumstances, than of habitual grief.
Montane
( 6y }
Montane, who, till then, had avoided recalling their misfortunes, for fear of adding to their Sufferings, Saw himSelf obliged, at last, to explain their situation to them.
\
“ You condescend,” Said he to them,
to trust to my directions, in order to get out of the kingdom, in which you are perSecuted. From the time my daughter informed me of your intentions, I have thought without ceasing for you; and this is my opinion.— If you turn to the right, you will find Luz and Bareges. Thefe two places are filled with your enemies; should you efcape their vigilance, you will not efcape thofe that watch at the bridge of Gabarnis. To the left lie St. Licer and Castel-loo, both equally dangerous.
“ It is true, that the passes of Aure
and
»
( 68 )
\
and Venafques are before you, and that way you may get into Spain, which is but five leagues from thence; but 1 have received undoubted intelligence
that they are carefully guarded.--------
This valley, and this fpot, above all, are the only ones sheltered from the enraged people of France. We owe this happy Security to the mountains which Surround us, and to’ our distance from every road sit for a carriage.—
Once only they thought to induce us to quit our peaceful modes of life, but the manner in which we,received this proposition must have deprived them
of all idea of renewing the endea-vou r
It will therefore be very imprudent for you to attempt the pafs at prefent. Remain with us: I am but a poor labourer, but I have a place to
lodge
■( h )
lodge you, and fruit to feed you. I shall not Speak of the privations you will have to undergo; my heart makes me feel them beforehand j but we shall find a way to alleviate thefe: rea-Son and necessity will do the rest.— A young man from Venafquct comes very often to this valley: we will make
him the confident of your situation: He is noble and a Spaniard ; affuredly

Yes; remain with us:” added Lou-

ifa, with vivacity, to the strange Lady.
You will enjoy our pleaSures, and, perhaps, you will not So much regret yourst.’*
The young man, abSorbed in thoSe reflections, which the words of Montane had given birth to, cast a look

upon his daughter; and, coming to an immediate decision, I yield, my father faid he, we shall obey you. And where, indeed, could we find a more fortunate abode, and more tender confolations ?—Learn, neverthelefs, my father, (for I cannot name you other-wife) to. whom you give life and happineSs. You may, perhaps, believe me

criminal, and my heart will only be at peace when we are justified.’’
Montane, who had riSen already to conduct them to Aranvilie, Seated himfelf anew, and the young man continued in thefe terms:

J
family.
** Honoured with employments of importance, he testified everywhere a zealous love and attachment to his King and country. Appointed to the first Presidency of one of thofe Sovereign courts, formerly the organs of the law, and the depositories of the rights of the people, he was one of thofe, who, during the last reign, had, more than once, dared to carry the complaints of the nation to the foot of the throne; and his noble firmneSs did not difpleale our Monarch. He was even destined to become the Supreme head oS the
magiS-
( 72 )
magistracy, when death carried him off from our affections; without a doubt Heaven wanted to recompense his virtues, in Sparing him the grief of Seeing thoSe evils which rend his country
aSunder.
“ He had three children, of whom* I am the Second. This sister, who you See, has always been endeared to me, more by the ties of triendship, than thoSe of blood. A long while beSore the French had proScribed the nobility, she lamented having been born in a situation too exalted for her happinefs. But I shall lay aside this Subject, that I may not renew her Sufferings.
« My brother, a great deal older than mySelf, had inherited a title from my father, while they gave me the nanie of my estate of Seville. Our dispositions did not harmonize together; our
tastes.
(	73	)
tastes, our inclinations, all were differ-
t
cnt. My brother, intoxicated with his
birth, only esteemed his equals.-----------
Shall I own it ? He held, perhaps, thofe odious principles which have provoked the fury of the people. His name had procured him a distinguished title in the career of arms, before his Services had been able to deServe it. He was brave, intrepid; his King was his God, and to obey him was his only duty.
You know the fatal designs which were attributed to our warriors. The people accufed my brother of having favored thefe plots; our foliositations had. in vain tried to engage him to Seek his fecurity out of the kingdom. From,his castle he appeared still to
brave the people of his demeSne. They
*
have revenged themfelves in a cruel

(	74	)
manner ; and my unfortunate brother has augmented the list of slaughtered nobles.
1 was at Paris with my sister, Solely occupied with the study of letters. I was innocent, and believed myfelf in
I
Safety; I was foon inSormed, however, that my brother was massacred, and that the Same Sate was intended for me. My name was become a crime, and I poffeffed one of thofe places, which, under the late Government, led to profitable employshents, but whofe title was abhorred in the provinces. My name, already repeated in the streets of the capital, by a furious troop, announced the Species of death to which we were destined. At the fame time this mad people obliged two of the m*ost eloquent defenders of their rights, to Seek a Sure afylum in Helvetia.
It
m
(	75	)	'
It was absolutely necessary to be Sanguinary, to fly, or to be massacred.
I choSe flight. The hope of Saving my sister emboldened my courage ; and, in five days, we have arrived in theSe countries. On our way we Saw, everywhere, blood-thirsty men. At ten leagues from hence we were stopped, and were over-whelmed with thofe outrages which cruel men shew to vene-
%
mous reptiles; but, while they prepared, doubtlefs, for us, one of the most cruel deaths, a dark night, and the assistance of one of their party, who detested their cruelty, in fecret, procured us our deliverance.
** Since then, wandering alone, on ■ foot, and at random, in the forests,
we found at laSr, a difficult path which
%
led to the heart of thefe mountains. We followed it; hunger, grief, fatigue,
E 2	devoured
(	7^	)
devoured us, but all thefe distresses did not stop us ; it Seemed continually to me that I beheld tigers followinec
O	o
us, ready to cast themSelves on my sister. From rock to rock we have "descended into this valley | where hid in this wood, motionleSs with lassitude, and weakened by the tortures of hunger and anxiety, defpair feemed to preclude all refourfe to our wretchednefs, when
this amiable shepherdefs came to cure all our for rows.”
Montane listened to Seville with the tender interest which the good take in all thofe who are unhappy. In place of loading him with thofe confolations, always fruitless when evils are yet recent; he fought to dissipate the recollection eft hem.
Henriette de Valledeuil had renewed her tears at the relation of her brother;
LouiSa
( 77 )
«
Louifa shared, while she wiped thern away.
Night had already began to appear, when they all four took their way to Aranvilie. With what pleaSure did our travellers take shelter under the root of Montane! Seville has repeated it a hundred times, he had never felt one equal to it, under the gilt cornices of the capital;
Sweet Sleep Soon came to make them Sorget their iatigues and then Sorrows. LouiSa alone could not enjoy it. This was the first time that repoSe had for-Saken her eye-lids; but it was alSo the first day that she loved. She herSelt did not SuSpect the cauSe; the Sweet palpitation, the Secret diSquiet, and the image, ever preSent, of Seville, the plfaSure which flie took to re-trace to herSelf all his words, the desire of be-
E 3 '	holding
(	78	}
holding once more the dawn, which was to prefent him to her sio-ht, fa-tigued her mind, without its beiiK>-able to detach itfelf from an object, already too much cherished.
Sometimes stie attributed to his birth, the afcendancy he had taken over her; Sometimes it was his misfortunes which had foftened her heart; and, in the
midft of thefe refleaions, the image
of Seville, his gestures, his deportment, his eyes, his flaxen hair, prefented themfelves to her looks, and the touching found of his voice feemed to refound in her ears.
The rising day had already diSpel-led the nocternal fliades, while Louifa was still plunged in thefe reflections; and her father, feated before his cottage door, converted with Seville. He had made him obferve the rising of
the
(	19	)
the Sun, that Superb sight, of which the rich are ignorant, and whofe magnificent beauty is known only to the shepherd of the Alps, or the Pyrenean
pastor.
The peaceable enjoyments of the simple cultivators were the fubject of their converfation. Montane pourtrayed the natural pleafures of the shepherds ; their joy, celebrated in fong, . which they feel at the return of the fpring, or when the fcorching dog-days gih!e<l their harvests j the fportive games, by which they signalized their strength, and their address, and demonstrate a perpetual gaiety.
It was by Such defcription as thefe, that the old man wished to foften, in his guell, the regret of the effeminate life of courts, by opposing to them the pure and simple pleafures of
E 4,	the
\
( 8o )
the country, wnich are the portion of the humblest class of citizens.
Seville was a young man, in the heart of whom, the manners and en-joyments of great towns had not yet quite extinguished the love of the true pleafures of nature. He heard with eager attention the dilcourSe of Montane ; his heart desired to make one in the number of shepherds of this district, and the past greatneSs no longer appeared cut as a burthen, of which he was happily relieved.
\
LouiSa appeared at last, accompanied
by Henrietta de Valledeuil, and their
arrival interrupted theSe rural reflexions.
Seville embraced his sister with the most
tender Sentiments of friendship. Come,”
laid he, “ enjoy with me the delightful de-
feriptions of our deliverer. W^e believe
*
thefe good people are unfortunate, and that
they
( 8i )
they envy our fate. What" errors'! and thou thyfelf, why hast thou not come Sooner, to hear the details oS the lives oS the inhabitants of thefe countries ? Behold thefe happy meadovys,, thefe fmiling hills, thefe winding waters, thefe flowers, as sine, and more fresh than thofe of our gardens. Nature has done all here; art does not disfigure her here, with a cold and heavy hand ; at most she Seconds her.
Behold this wood, where this able mistrefs, interweaves the honeyfuckle with the beech, and the cyprefs with the ever-green pine fo much better than our gardeners ! What are our enjoyments, compared to thofe which
i
thefe places offer to their cultivators !	Thou wert in the right; it
is only in the fields that one can be happy ! This mediocrity, of which thorn
'	*	if ^
E 5	wert
( 82 }
wert ambitious, this liberty, which, alas! has formed the object of thy desires, and thy misfortunes, is to be found here. Pardon me;	1 recal a
cruel recollection, but my heart fliares it.”
Then, addressing himfelf to Montane and to Louifa, You fee my sister clouded with a cruel chagrin : do not believe that this place has the least
share in it. All her life she loved the country and mediocrity. There was a time when she would have esteemed herfclf happy in this abode. A houSe, like your’s this little garden, thefe meadows, would have fatissied all her desires and wiflies; her heart had made its choice, and the pride of greatness had not directed her Sentiments. Fate has contradicted her hopes, but time has not changed her heart.—

Beautiful fliepherdefs, if you have been infensible hitherto, you will love one day; but then the iron feeptre of prejudice, and the cruel authority of your parents, will not poifon in you the Sweetest Sentiment of vour exist-
cnce.”
Thefe w'ords, pronounced with the sire with which Seville animated all his difeourfes, were a ray of light, which painted to Louifa her real fentiments. Her heart, which beat powerfully, the oppression on her breathing,^ a violent agitation, the trouble of her thoughts,
f
all told her that she loved; the fpeech of Seville Seemed to announce that she was not beloved in her turn, and this avowal, which she forced from herfelf,
t
added to the violence of her situation.
i
7
All the most overwhelming reflections offered themSelves in crowds to her ima-
E 6	gsination.
I
( 84 )
r
<
imagination. « It is all over,” faid lier heart to her, 1 have let mySelf be overcome; love has penetrated .... What do I Say ! It burns already in all my veins: and by whom has my weak heart Suffered itSelf to be Surprized ? By a stranger, who I Saw yesterday for the first time, and who, i very foon shall fee no longer;—
• s
whofe fortune, birth, and condition, are
as much above mine, as our mountains are the valley. An immenfe interval. Separates us, and what remains for me? Shame, regret, and eternal grief.”
It was thus that the tender LouiSa deplored in herSelf, both her own weak-nefs, and the unfortunate chance which had led Seville thither. As for him, he had beheld Louifa with that fofc cm.otion with which a young man, of a feeling heart, always pays the tribute
to
( 85 ) '
•9
to beauty. Her simple manners, her ingenuous language, and the touching candor of her foul had not eScaped him ; but, Sull of the great object of his Safety, and of that of his sister, he had not, till then, been able to open his heart to other fentiments.
4
The rapid reflexions of LouiSa had troubled her So much, that her emotion was visible. Every one perceived it, and manifested their uneasineSs. This was Sufficient to deprive her of all strength and courage. She thought that every one read her heart, and that they beheld her love for the stranger; and that contempt and ignominy were going to overwhelm her for ever, LouiSa
could not resist this shock.
Happy timidity of innocence, which
is still willing to combat the inclination of which nature has planted the
Seeds
{ %6 )
feeds in our Souls, how rare art thou *
in tov ns, where premature enjoyments, and untimely corruption is habitual! But how Sweet a sight art thou to the tender and diScreet lover, who dares to applaud his triumph !
Seville did not know the value of this
rnoment ,• but his attentions re-animated
LouiSa, who was fainting, and he owed
the pleafure of loving, to the happineSs of being So.
Henrietta, till then. Sad and pensive; had flown to the assistance of the shepherdeSs ; and her efforts, united to thoSe of her brother, re-called her, with difficulty, to the light. Both her hands were in thoSe of Seville; her first emotion was to tear them away Srom him.
It is thus that love instructs the shepherdeSs to be cirumSpect and reScrved. Seville thought he remarked in this
gesture
0
{ 87 )
gesture an emotion of vexation; the difcourSe he had held, the fudden fainting of LouiSa, which had followed, presented themSelves rapidly to his imagina-tion; he believed he had been indif-creet or guilty j and throwing himSelf at her feet, he begged her forgiveness, which she was but too much difpofed
to grant.
Tears c^mc happily to the relief of L^ouif^.; istnd, in the rnidft of her fobs, turning ^iidc thofe fine eyes which dreaded to meet thofe of Seville, fhe gave him, in place of an anfwer, thofe broken and unmeaning words, which circumstances exact, and which the heart does not dictate.
Montane was the only one who thought he conceived the Secret motives of the Scene which had just passed ; but she relied on the virtue of his daughter, and on
the
( 88 >
the considence which she had in him. To Spare her cmbarrassrnenT, as Soon as she was a little recovered, he gave her a commission, which left her time to recover herSelS entirely, out of the prefence of his guests. And, taking the short and knotted stick, on which he Supported his trembling hands, he Said to Seville, that he would' go, under Some pretence to Traimefanges, in order to inform himfelf more exactly of
the manner in which the pastes were guarded.
I leave you” added he. Smiling, and
looking at his daughter, I leave you with LouiSa. I hope she wnll not renew the late Scene: Pardon her, in consideration oS the impression which your misfortunes have made on her.” LouiSa ashamed, wished for the darkest -night to conceal her from all beholders ;
but
%
*
1
(	89	)
but it v/as clear day, and the piercing eyes of a lover devoured her.
The moinent of her fainting away,
I
by atti acting the whole attention of Seville to her assistance, had shewn him all her beauty. He had not been able to fee So many charms without becoming extremely enamoured with her j— or rather, the first impression she had
made on him, though for Some time
• %
obScured by a SenSe of his misSortunes, now appeared in all its strength. It
was thus, that whilst Louifa deplored her defeat, Seville owned his to himfelf.
Not leSs uneaSy than LouiSa, but through a different motive, if Seville did not feek to extinguifli his flame, he trembled, at least, that it was not reciprocal. His timidity had only shewn
%
him, in the eyes of Louifa, fpite and
anger.
( 90 J
anger, in place of love and confusion, which animated them.
Montane was gone; Seville was with Louifa; beloved her; he was eloquent and Quick in his passions; the uncertainty of a moment appeared to him alreadr,
0 *
the torture of a century ; and, neverthelefs, he durst not open his heart. He became melancholy’ in his turn and oppressed ; while LouiSa, relieved by her tears, had armed herSelf with what she deemed a Sufficient degree of courage to conquer her passion, or, at least, to take the knowledge of it from all that
Surrounded her.
time kept up
a languid and indifferent converfation,
between two perfons, who would have desiied, and who feared, at the fame time, to understand each other.
Louifa, who thought she Saw the troubles
4
( 91	)
bles of her guests renewed, tried to console them for their preSent Situation, in picturing to them a more happy futurity.
“ Amiable shepherdefs,” replied Seville, how fweet your confolations would be, if you read our hearts; if the happy futurity which you paint to us, offered the image of the kind of happinefs which I desire. It is true the past afflicts, and the future alarms me, but it is from caules very different from thofe you fuppofe me to have. You See me Sad ; it is the fear cf having offended you, of having difpleaf-ed you; and if my blood, shed on the fpot, could atone for my words, it would prove to you that my whole desire was to convince you of the fweet impression that your fensibility, for our misfortunes, has caufed us. Charming LouiSa, 1 own it to you, I can no longer Separate your
pcrSpn
f 92 )
perfon from your favors. Ah, why cannot your fenfibility be extended to the
unfommatc as well as to their misfor. tunes !
Louifa feigned not to understand Seville, but a Soft blush covered her checks; her heart told her she was beloved ; siie
was enchanted with her triumph j and the joy which Sparkled in her eyes betrayed her heart. Seville read his pardon there; he fancied he Saw there a new-born love, and his heart expanded
at the hope of being happy, like a rofe, clofed in by the night, at the first ray
of the morning-Sun.
Unfeeling man, who hast never loved, you whofe cold foul has never felt thofe tender emotions which follow each other with the rapidity of lightning; this hope, to which fear fucceeds, and which vanishes m the moment of its birth, to
re-appear
p
( 93 )
%
re-appear very foon with new strength; you who have never read, with joy, in the eyes of an innocent and timid shepherdefs, desire, fear,, and love, combated by rigorous duty, palsions, which by turns colour her cheeks, and make her heart beat; to you, I Say, our recitals will appear cold and minutious. BecauSe you never were happy, your hearts cannot
believe in Senfations which have ever
#
remained unknown to them. But thou,
I
happy Seville, thou enjoyest thy victory! the Sweet balm of hope circulates wsith love in thy veins. Gaiety, joy and happinefs re-appears on his face; and he is once more that young man cited in the brilliant circles of the capital.
Louifa admires her lover, and cheriflies her love with delight; it is thus that love can at will, with a word, and in an instant, change our existence, and
4	our
( ■ 94	)
/
our being, destroy, of make our talents shine.
Whilst Seville applauded himSelf for
having read the heart of his shepherdeSs ; while LouiSa was occupied with the happinefs of being beloved, and that this
fweet SenSation threw every other rcflec-
\
tion at a distance; the old Montane turning home from Traimefanges, made
Some that were more Solid, and leSs Smiling.
The connexion of his fon with one
above his rank had been the occasion of his premature death; and, by an inconceivable fatality, he law a great lord obliged to feek an afylum from him, and who would, perhaps, make an impression on the heart of his daughter,
which might render her^equally unfortunate.
A	age, experience, and
the
y
y
( 95	)
the example of his fon, always preSent to his memory, had rendered anxious, with regard to every thing that might be Satal to his beloved child, had watched
4
her looks, her words, and even her silence. Pedrera had given him little un-' easineSs; Seville made him already apprehensive. Sometimes he taxed his fears as chimerical ; Sometimes, giving way to them, he thought he beheld LouiSa the prey to a foolish passion j and, with whatever interest Seville might have infpired him, he could not look on him but as one of thofe men of the world, who poffeSs the fatal talent of pleasing, only to make a bad uSe of it.
“ It is then true,” faid he, with bit-terneSs, the great are always a curSe for the man whom they, approach. Like the Pyrenean Avalanches, their rapid courSe tears and destroys the weak shrub
which
( 96 )
I
which meets their passage ; thus the noble and the rich, crush at pleaSure, the poor man whom they meet with.’*
He had always fulsilled with joy the duties of hofpitality, for this time alone, he feared that a good action w;ould only produce the bitter fruit of regret.
o
What afflicted him most was, that the
passages, strictly guarded, obliged Seville to prolong his stay with him. He announced this news to them. Seville received it. with joy. The colour of the rofe is more pale than the crimSon with which the cheeks of Louifa were covered at hearing it. Till then, contented with loving, and with the hope of being So • the idea of distance had not yet troubled their happinefs : The arrival of Montane
had given birth to this dread, and his recital dissipated it.
This old man watched LouiSa : very
/	Soon
( 97 )
Soon confirmed in his fears; and being
no longer able to hide the truth from
\
himfelf, he fought the moment to Speak to her in private.
What are not the prodigious effedls of thoSe pafflons with which we let ourSelves be Surprised ? LouiSa, who had never beheld her Sather but as a friend,
and whofe conversation, and mutual confidence had formed, till now, all her felicity, this fame Louifa, to-day con-fufcd and embarrassed, when alone with him, dares neither open her heart to him,
nor raife her eyes, which betray her.---
Regret Sor having been conquered by her passion, a regret Soon dissipated by love itSelf, now awoke. The abySs which is before her feet is no longer veiled^; the illusions of hope are dissipated, and the unfortunate creature felt no longer in her heart. Save love alone,
L	the
’ ( 9S )
the cauSe of her forrows; but like thofe terrible fires, known in ages past, and which take new strength in the element destined to extinguish them, LouiSa feels her love encreafe, even then when all tells her it will be the caufe of her misfortune.
Montane himSelf, the old Montane, in place of reproaches, wished to confole his daughter. His tears mix with his embraces; grief fuSpends his voice ; ‘.Dou-ifa,” faid he, with an effort, at last, this misfortune which, 1 dreaded, is then true: thy weak heart is conquered, and the confidence of my daughter has not preceded . the fears of her fatlier. Behold the precipice into which ihou thro west thyfelf. Thou wert the happiest of shepherdesses; they named thee the ornament of our country; how many times did I feel vain at the eulogiums given to my Louifa!
Heaven
'(	99 )
Heaven is juft j it puniftres my vanity.—
And for whom does thy heart sigh ? If it was one of our shepherds I should blefs my daughter and her lover; the day of their union would recall my younger days, and the day following my white hairs
t
would repofe in peace in the grave ; for I should know my Louifa was happy. But one day has triumphed over thee,—A stranger, unknown, of the number of thofe whom they name the tyrants of our country, has furprifed thy heart; and dost thou know thyfelf if he shares thy fentiments ? And then it would be an additional misfortune.
“ Believe in the experience, in the friendship of thy old father. Thefe men, brought up in greatneSs, SilSe through habit, and by education, defpife every thing that is not themfelves ; ail that have not thofe frivolous ad-

vantages which ornament without rendering them better. Their tongue, cxer-
cifed feigns what their heart does not feel. They hardly look on us as beings
of the Same Species. To Seduce and to
deceive us is a fport for them, which costs ' them no remorfe.
'' Seville is young, and his Soul Seems pure: Mistrust, my daughter, theSe vain illusions, deceitful fruits of appearances still more deceitful. Seville has the prejudices of his birth, and the falfehood of his condition, joined to this Seductive po-liteneSs, and to theSe too brilliant talents, which he difplays in vain, in order to perSuade us that they are without blemish.
Thrown on our generosity, and in want of our assistance, he wishes to foften us with regard to his unhappy fate. He knows that virtue inhabits the
country;
C loi )
country ;—he borrows the voice of virtue. Soon at liberty, in the heart of Spain, re-united to thofe of his own rank, we and our Services shall be forgotten. May we be able to Sorget them with the Same facility, and as few regrets !
** LouiSa, one word alone ought to recall thee to thy duty. Thy brother, our dear Adrien, exists no longer, and it was the great who niade him perifli, becaufe he was So unfortunate as to love. Thou knowest that all the news which our grief has been able to collect concerning him has been, that a vile aS-Sassination, diret^ied by the brother of his mistreSs, who believed himlelf dishonored by this demand, hastened his end.—— Think on thy brother; and remember that old Montane will never Suffer the
F 3	murderers
i
( ^02 )
murderers of his fon to deprive him of his remaining child.”
LouiSa, drowned in tears, felt only the grief of having offended her. fither. This last remonstrance pierced her to the foul. She pronounced the vow to forget Seville, to reject his wishes, and to tear Srom her heart this involuntary inclination which governed her.
Thus this unfortunate creature felt
4
the pains of love before she knew its pleafures; and, deceiving herSelf, her mouth promifed more than it was possible for her to perform.
Contented with her promiSes, the old man felt his heart relieved, and thenceforward he beheld the stay of the two strangers prolonged without usteasinefs.
Louifa, faithful to her oath, perceived very Soon how weak she was in its performance.
(	103	)
formance. She now began to uSe all means to obtain the strength which her heart refufed her. Seville perceived that he was shunned; that l ouifa, continually with her father or Henrietta, feared, in like manner to meet his looks, and even to hear the found of his voice. In vain he fought an opportunity to converSe with her alone, Louifa fled him with care; her frankneSs, her innocence had difappeared, and her converfation was nothing more than cool civility.
Montane applauded himfelf for the effo Its which he faw his daughter make to conquer herfelf; and fearing that the conduct of Louifa might afflict Seville, in perfuading him that he 'was looked on as a troublefome guest, the old man re-r doubled his cares and attentions to-w^ards him ; but the feeble confola-
F 4	tions
(	104	)
tions of Sriendship were far from making amends Sor the pains of love.
Many days had passed without young Seville having been able to Speak alone with LouiSa, and his love had still increased by thefe obstacles. The singular conduct: which they held with him, appeared inexplicable; nevertheless it
engaged him to make reasonable reflections.
Hitherto he had acted like all young men who poffefs much fensibility, and who let themSelves be carried away by
their passions, without meaSuring the conSeciuences, or calculating their end.
What am I doing ?** Said he, at last, to himfelf. Still in the midst of dan-
9
ger; before I am even sheltered from the cruelties which have occasioned my flight, I" abandon mySelf to a violent
pashon;
4
( xos )
passion; by turns I hope, I fear; but still my love remains, and encreaSes hourly. It is true, she whom I adore joins to the purest Soul a heavenly countenance i and this virtue, this enchanting SweetneSs, which I Sought in vain in our proud capital: but, if she has the virtues of a queen, her birth is that of a shepherdeSs.
** Shall I endeavour to awaken in her heart Sentiments, which will form the misfortune of her life? Shall I betray the hoSpitality ? Shall I corrupt innocence ? and as a reward for having reScued me from death..............Rather
let me become a victim to the fury of a mad populace, better than to justify the horrors which they commit towards thoSe of my rank!
Shall I abandon LouiSa ?—Shall I put my heart to silence ? No j this is an
F 5	effort
( io6 )
effort to which I am unequal. And what Signisies to me this rank,, which is
thus persecuted and debaSedWill it avail me in foreign countries ? Yes j the Scoff and Sport of an unSeeling multitude, it will Serve, like the monuments of ancient Rome, for vile reptiles to defile, and asses to trample on. Why shall I listen then to the voice of thefe vain prejudices ? If my sister is unfortunate, is it not becaufe this vain pride, which they termed a noble way of thinking, has struck her ?
« They persecute us ; and of all their
violent decrees, thrown out to destroy us, as the Spanish dogs were formerly let looSe in Peru, to devour the Indians ; shall I not avail mySelf of the only one, which, in the prefent moment, can flatter my heart, that which abolishes ranks, and places us on a level with the shepherds ?
(	107	)
herds? Yes, men are equal; there are only our executioners, who form an abhorred fpecies apart.
Louifa has the advantages over me
of beauty, wit, the graces, and a purer virtue; fne is then Superior to me. It
is therefore for me to adore her, to try
0 _ _
to pleafe her,, and to esteem myfelf happy to obtain her. And then let us live in Solitude, concealed, quiet, and, if it is possible, unknown to the uni-
verfe.
My sister thinks as I do ; I fly my country, which abandons me ; no particular place attaches me, they have i broken all ties; I adore Louifa, perhaps
I might be able to render her happy.”
0
Such were the rapid and impetuous reflexions which the young Seville made on the banks of the Rioumayour. His
heart was conSoled, his mind became
F 6	quiet,
V
\
( io8 )
quiet; he only lived for Louifa. His . fortune, in part Secured in England, and partly in Spain, was Sufficient to procure him an honourable existence. The estates which he left in France became indifferent to him : his name, his titles, his place, were uSeleSs to him, and were to be the first Sacrifices on which he was to build his happineSs.
Filled with this Sweet idea, he reSolved to open himSelS to Louifa ; to endeavour to pleafe, and to obtain the conSent oS
the respectable Montane.
In the midst of theSe dreams of hope, Seville reSumed the way to the cottage. A path presents itSelf to his sight; it was that of the Fountain of Shepherdesses. «Come,” faid he, « let us visit once more this charming afylum; there I Saw LouiSa for the first time; yes, this place will always be dear to my heart.” He
Siry
fpeaks,
»
t
(	109	)
Speaks, and already his steps approach the fountain.
It was there that LouiSa fought, in this moment, to relieve, by her tears, the
grievous weight which oppressed her.—
«
She would have wished to forget Seville,
and all her effort^ only Served to recall his
%
image.
An imperious duty, her promiSes, might oblige her to overwhelm Seville with counterfeited marks of indifference, to fly his preSence, and to reject his vows; but could she change her heart ? No; she had Satisfied her virtue, and here her whole heart expended itfelf in fobs.
Seville approaches; he Sees LouiSa> her head leant against an old willow ; an handkerchief covered her face. The pleaSure of devouring her charms stops him for a moment; he foon perceives
her
( iiq ]
her grief; Sear freezes his Soul; and a SenSation oS reSpect; bid him retire.— LouiSa turns her head, perceives Seville, believes herSelf betrayed, and wishes
f
to fly. Seville, carried away by an involuntary emotion, darts like lightning in her way, and Stops her. Louifa defends herfelf, Seville was already at her feet; his hands preSs thofe of Louifa, and hindered her from flying. Adorable Louifa, pardon me, for having in my misfortune troubled your retreat; and deign to inform me of my crime.— You shun me—you hate me-—I, wsho
would have placed my whole felicity in
%
pleasing you. By what means have I merited this afflicting change ? A few days ago, unknown and a fugitive, your goodnefs Saved my life; at prefent the sight of me Seems to inSpire you with
terror;—your tears flow. Where is the
adorable
/
( I” )
adorable confidence which was in:everything you faid ? What are the motives of your tears ? Confide your griefs in me. Ah, if my fortune, if all I have, all I am, and every thing I can do, could
banish the slightest of your Sorrows.......
And, nevertheless, it would not be the most difficult Sacrifice I could make.” . .,
\
Seville," Said LouiSa, interrupting him, ** If I shed tears it is for fpite, becaufe I cannot hinder myfelf Srom shedding them. Since I have feen you I cannot possibly have done otherwise than feel my esteem Sor you increafed; you
cannot have offended me. Let this be fufficient; I cannot tell you more on this Subject: j if you will indeed oblige me, you will leave an unfortunate shep-herdefs.” Saying thefe words, her tears
4
began anew to flow, and profoundly sighing, she withdrew.
'	Seville
( II2 )
Seville, struck like an oak which has been shivered with a stroke oi lightning. Seemed still to hear her; while LouiSa was already out of the forest.
Seville warm in his temper, gifted with an ardent and active imagination, loved, for the first time, that is to Say, with fury and passion. He reflected on the words of Louifa, on her grief, on the Secret which she wished to keep with fo much obstinacy'; and he was very foon perSuaded that he had a rival; that this rival was beloved, and that LouiSa, without doubt, contradicted in her inclination, and finding obstacles to her wishes, mourned her misfortunes. But
who could this rival be ? Without doubt a simple shepherdi Could not this obstacle be removed ? Perhaps fo ; but LouiSa loves him; and shall Seville de-»
bale
( ”3 )
baSe his birth, and betray his virtue, by Surprising a heart given by love, with the Splendor of fortune ?
All at once decided by honor, he reSolved to Sacrifice himSelf for the happinefs of LouiSa. I cannot be happy ; at least let the happineSs of my shepherdeSs conSole me. My fortune is immenfe. I shall share it with her. Gold, for once employed uSefully, fliall repair the evils which its abuSe has So often occasioned: Without a doubt it may remove the obstacles which oppole the wishes of LouiSa. I shall be unfortunate, but I shall have been just: No ; I shall not be altogether unSortu-nate. Virtue conSoles for the privations which she caufes. ' Let us then fly j perhaps, one day, I shall Sorget...........
No; I shall never forget LouiSa ; but I shall no longer drink from her eyes the
poiSon
( )
poiSon which kills me.’» Thus reafoned Seville, in quitting the shepherdefs.
Meanwhile Pedrera, conducted by his love, had returned to the Vale of Aure. This gallant Spaniard knew how to adore in silence, and to Suffer without murmuring. Perhaps he still hoped Something from time, a change of events, and, above all, from his constancy.______
Hope, it is Said, never dies but with us.
Montane expected him with impatience, in order, by his shill, to facilitate
the passage of the Pyrenees to Seville and to Henrietta, and to procure them a Sure
aSv lum at Venafques. Pedrera, inSormed that his pretence was desired at Aranvilie, had flown to the old man.
This last, as he had warned Seville, did not hesitate to make a full considence to the Spaniard. He named de Valledeuil,
( i«5 )
deuil, his Situation, and what they wished from his assistance. Proud to be able to oblige the father of his mistrefs, he had offered immediately every thing that depended on him to make the projected evasion Succeed; and they con-verfed on the meafures they were to take, when Louifa returned home, after having fled from Seville.
The Scene which had just passed had rekindled all the violence of her lovc; and it was not without a great effort that she had been able to fee Valledeuil at her feet, without betraying her promifes, and without discovering her heart to him. This effort had exhausted her; and, a prey to defpair, her tottering limbs had, with fome difficulty, brought her back to the cottage.
Pedrera was the first object who pre-
Sented himSelf to her sight; He was with
her
( )
her father, and they were fixing for tomorrow, the departure of Seville.---------
Louifa heard it: She uttered a violent cry, fell down inSensible, and almost without life. Henrietta and Valledeuil
received her in their arms; and. Seconded by Pedrera, who deluged her with remedies, they brought her back to life and to her griefs.
What a cruel sight to old Montane I He Saw his beloved daughter the voluntary victim of her obedience and her virtue. This unfortunate father could neither retain his grief nor his Sobs; he reproached himSelf with the Sufferings of LouiSa, as if they had been his work. Some indiscreet lamentations eScaped him. The Sensible and Seeling Pedrera heard them, and guessed the rest; and from this moment he impoSed on himfelf the most painful of all Sacrifices, that
of
I
( II7 )
of thinking no more of LouiSa, but in order to labor Sor her happineSs.
She had reSumed her SenSes, but without recovering her strength, and a burning Sever devoured her. The Sad Henrietta had conducted her to her
4
chamber, where they remained alone, that LouiSa might enjoy the sleep, which was necessary for her.
Montane and Pedrera, both profoundly afflicted, but through different motives, began to relume their converfation, when Seville, returning to execute his project, Sound them together.
Behold,” Said Montaine to Seville, shewing him to Pedrera, Behold the Spanish nobleman on whom I relied for your deliverance,, and we have not confided without reafon in the honor of his fentiments.
Pedrera, for Some moments, had been
4	certain
( ii8	}
certain	that	Valledeuil	had robbed	him
of the heart of Louifa j he never-thclefs	embraced his	rival	with	the
fame warmth which made him labor for his evasion.
k
%
Seville, still occupied with the project of quitting Louifa, received with
ardour	the	efforts of	the	Spaniard.
They were nearly of the fame age, and of the fame height.
Pedrera, known as a stranger, could
pafs freely, and was no longer even
0
Searched. It was then reSolved that Se-
I
ville Snould take his cloaths, whilst Henrietta should dreSs like a shepherdefs, by means of the habits of Louifa, whofe name she should in like manner assume. Montane was to accompany them; and it was to be prefumed that they would neither stop at the passage, the falSe Spaniard, nor the old man, nor she who was
f
to
( II9 )
to pafs for his daughter. Although it was next to impossible that Valledeuil, under the habit of Pedrera, should create any fufpicion; nevertheless out of precaution, he was to have his pocket-book, to impost on thofe who might stop him.
The Scheme Seemed well laid; Pedrera regretted only his not being able to
accompany them; but prudence demanded that he should wait till they had attained a country-houSe which he had, near VenaSques, and where he intended to join them, as Soon as the return of Montane should have informed him of their Safe arrival.
Their departure was anew fixed for that very evening. • It was requisite to gain the defiles of the mountains before day, in order not to be difcovered by the herds of the valley, who knew Pedrera, and, above all, LouiSa, too welt,
to
( 120 )
^ to be the dupe of thoSe who were to wear their habits. TheSe precautions were So much the more neceslary, that the inhabitants of the neighbourhood could hardly be ignorant that unknown perSons- were at Montane’s; and even distant emissaries were Said to have appeared in the valley.
As Soon as the plan of their evasion was quite Settled, Don Juan de Pedrera returned to his farm, to write Some let-
N
ters, of which it was necessary for Seville
to be the bearer. This last remained with Montane.
This unfortunate father hid under a Serene forehead a Soul torn to pieces. In precipitating the departure of Seville, he knew he was going to strike another
stroke, perhaps mortal, to his dear Louifa.
«
Acquainted with the profound fensibility of her heart, he knew not how she
could
•/
( 121 )
could resist the abSence of Valledeuil; she who had never been able to Support the idea of it. But virtue and honor
Spoke, and Montane had always listened to their voiee.
On his side, our young Frenchman was only Supported in his painful Sacrifice, by the enthusiafm which the idea of rendering LouiSa happy cauSed to him; he Sorgot himSelf, in order to view, and to be occupied with her alone. It was in the force of his delpair, that he
found strength enough to conquer his passion.
A moment’s silence had Succeeded the departure of the Spaniard. Seville interrupted it very Soon; and, pressing in his hands thoSe of the old man: ‘‘ My father,”'Said he, *'I am going very foon to quit the land which gave me birth, the country which I idolized, and which
G	repulSes
( 122 )
repulfes me from its bofom. My wishes will always be for her welfare: Yes, in Ipite of the cruelties of my countrymen, the horror of all feeling hearts, and the astonishment of Sovereigns, I still love them : Not the French, thirsty of blood, listening to no other voice but that of vengeance, beholding no virtue. Save in a frightful diforder, and loading a Sovereign with affliction, whoSe goodneSs they must own, in Spite of their blindnefs. Not thefe, but the French, mild, amiable, generous ; Such they were, and Such I
hope yet, one day, to behold them.
/
And if they are always Seduced by ambitious chiefs, 1 shall try to forget them; but I fliall always fay to myfelf. There was a man among them, a man, good without interest, virtuous without ostentation, and generous towards thofe of
whom he might have complained. This
man
‘	I
(	123 )
man is you, and your memory, engraven* on my heart, will relieve my regret; for I shall know that there is yet a good citizen in an empire in which the world is debaSed.
** My father, I owe you more' than
«
life J for I owe you that of my sister. It is true, mine is of no price; and in this moment, still more than in any Other, it would be Sweet to me to loSe an existence which is become painful to me: but it would have been painful for
me to have Seen my Sister at the mercy of thefe tigers. ‘
Some aays have been fufficient for me to learn to know you. I will not Speak to you of my gratitude: You have found in your heart the recompcnce of your action, the only one which is worthy of you. But 1 still dare beg one favor of you;—do not refufe it me. I
G 2	have
(	124	}
have a desire to contribute to the happinefs of one who merits it, and to whom I am under infinite obligations. This perSon is in France, and in a province where I have very few ac-quaintances, and whoSe delicacy would lead to a reSuSal of my gifts. What do I
4.
fay ? My giSts ? It is a Small part of what I owe : and on the other hand, I cannot, without your assistance, tranSmit them. You will neither be SuSpicious to
virtue, nor watched in your steps.------------
But, before I open my heart to you. Swear to me that, faithful to the performance of my desires, you will execute my wishes with fidelity; and that you will employ whatever depends on you to make them fucceed.”
“ Yes, Seville;” faid the old man,
0
“ I promiSe it. If it is in question to render any one happy, or to do a good
action.
4
(	125	)
action, if Heaven grants me time I shall
yet find strength.”
This promiSe is SufficientSaid
Seville:	but do not forget that you
have made it to me.-------1 have already
Spoken to you of my birth; of this
%
frivolous advantage, which is become So unfortunate to us;—my fortune is still more considerable; and, in fpite of the diminution which circumstances may occasion to it, the death of my elder brother, and the care that my father
»
has taken to place a part of his funds in foreign countries, leave me very considerable resources. But you know, virtuous Montane, it is not Sufficient to be
\
. rich, in order to be happy; and, with my gold, you See me the most unfortunat® of mortals.
“ I adored a charming girl; she rc-fcmbled LouiSa : Beautiful as she is, her
G 3	foul
( 126 )
Soul, like her’s, was still more So. Let not my words Surprize you, if here the graces are united to virtue ; Heaven has, perhaps, given birth to a fecond LouiSa, and my love has been able to find in her the fame attractions which your daughter poffelTes.
I had not the happineSs of being beloved; her heart was already occupied ; and, beSore I Spoke, I Saw myfelf constrained to a grievous and eternal silence.
I penetrated her eyes, Sometimes obScured by tears. Perhaps a word eScaped from her heart: I learnt that she was in love; ab^s! it was not with me. It is impossible that he for whom her heart
declares itfelf, should not love and adore
/
her as I do, for nobody can approach her with indifference. She has every thing
to pleafe : She is but too Superior to me
in
(	127	)
every thing; but file is unprovided with
9
the gifts of fortune, which do not render us happy but in their employment.
Without a doubt this obstacle hinders her happinefs; and my uneasineSs will only be relieved, when I know her to be So.	..
“ I have already informed you, I have infinite obligations to her : I am rich ; 1 have even here, still with me, an hundred thoufand livres of this lioht
O
fubstitute, which our perfecutors have invented; and which I have faved from the Searches of their Satellites. Take tlieSe; they are uSelefs to me. When I shall have attained the capital of Spain,
where a part of my fortune awaits me, you will make her I adore accept what I
leave with you, and you will have relieved

It is always fweet to See others do the generous actions of which we find ourSelves capable. Montane Softened by the fentiments of Seville, received his papers, and repeated to him the oath to have
them conveyed to the perfon whofe
»
name and abode it now only remained for him to learn.
• ^
“ I triumph at last,” cried Seville, have received your promiSe; honor forbids you to recall it. She I. adore is LouiSa: Yes, it is your daughter.— Pardon me a Sentiment from which in vain I have endeavoured to defend myfelf.
" I was going to throw my perfon and my fortune at your feet, at her’s : too happy to become the fon of the virtuous Montane. A moment has destroyed my hopes: I have furprifed the heart of LouiSa; She loves—May th’eSe
weak
C 129	)
weak marks of my friendship raife, to her him whom her heart has choSen 1’* " Seville,” replied Montane, coldly, ** you thought to deceive an old man: Happily I am not bound by my promiSes : Take back again your gifts, and hear me. Although the Splendor of greatnels cannot dazzle me^ I own
to you, nevertheless, that my pride triumphed in hearing you name my dear
LouiSa for the object of your attachment.
“ You love her; I am willing to believe it: But this inclination. Sprung up in a morning, will vanish in a Space like that which has formed it. Let us lay aside this reflexion, which you are not at preSent in a Situation to bear. I own further to you, that if your station was on a level with mine, I should be vain of your choice. I do justice to
G 5	what
*
(	13° )
what you appear to me to merit, in telling you what my friendship thinks of you; You must, however, reSume your benefaction; and to compel you to it, you oblige me to justify myfelf in your eyes, and to inform you of two painful truths.
An invincible reafon, which men and nature can neither annihilate nor diminish, forces me to Set my daughter at a distance from all that are of distinguished birth J or thoSe titles which our legislature have proScribed, but which they cannot destroy, since they are the
i
fruits of birth.
" I do not wish to afflict you, but learn, that it is thefe nobles that have killed my Son, the Support oS my
V
white hairs, and of this LouiSa whom you love. I do not confound you with them: No, my dear Seville j but I
have
( HI J
have Sworn that the blood of thoSe who have deprived me of my Son,
shall never unite with my Louifa.— LouiSa has repeated my oath, and she wsill be Saithful to it.
After this avowal, which Separates her for ever from you, it is necessary to make you one still more painful.
My daughter has not the Sentiments which, you SuppoSe her to have; Riches are uSeleSs to her happineSs; and it is Sor that reaSon that I return to you your’s. If it could have fulsilled your intentions I should have kept them, becauSe I had promised it.
It is true she loves, but it is you yourSelf who have SurpriSed her heart, to her misfortune and mine. A cruel Sacrifice is necessary to all of us. You must ' fly thefe places; leave her and me; and let her for ever remain ignorant of her

triumph. I shall conSole her. The mutual confident of your Secrets and your griefs, I shall feel your pains; and the most cruel of mine will be to
have a Secret from my LouiSa.
/ •
I forbid you all objections j they
«
will be in vain ; if you love me, if you love LouiSa ; forget her: It is her father who intreats you to it.’*
** Me forget her!” Said Seville, with a gesture of fury. Forget LouiSa! No : do not believe it.
« Montane, I shall obey you. To^
morrow I leave this country, and you; my country which I ever loved, but
which I now hate. I shall never See LouiSa, but to Sorget her! you can neither constrain nor exact it from me.
** Powers eternal! it is then me that she loves; and it is this unfortunate rank
which Separates me from her for ever.
“ There
•a.
(	133	1
^ There were yet new griefs in store for me! I have felt them, and I no longer fear the strokes of fortune : she has Spent all her store.
“ Montane, pardon my deSpair. I See
your Softened eyes pity me; and, never-
J
thelefs, there is no hope for Seville. You alledge your oath to me, the crime of thoSe of my birth,* becauSe twenty millions of Frenchmen of your rank, breathe nothing but blood, is your heart leSs pure, leSs humane ? Will my

deSpair restore your Son to you ? or do you desire this frightful vengeance.”
No;” replied the old man with mildneSs: But I have promiSed, and remember, it was to the bleeding shade of my Son.”
« You recall me to my duty; to be Silent and Suffer,” Said Seville, and from
this

C 134	)
this moment complaint died away in his mouth.”
Montane, too much oppressed to Support longer the accents of his defpair, left our young Frenchman alone, to reflect; on the cruel caprice of his fate.— Henrietta came to interrupt theSe reflexions.
LouiSa enjoyed the Sleep of fatigue, and her friend refpecting her repoSe, made uSe of it to rejoin her brother, whom she had not feen for many hours.
« gOj nay sister,” faid Seville to her, with a cold and dry tone, as foon as he Saw her. “ The dawn no longer
O
Sees us in Aranvilie: Thank thy benefactor; it is all we can do for him ; he is above our favors.”
“ I know it, my brother,” anSwered Henrietta; but are you not afraid to
quit

1
f ^35	)
quit thefe places? You told me, even yesterday, that you never were So happy as among theSe good people. And I may ash how shall I quit LouiSa ? Without doubt gratitude attaches me to this
amiable perSon ; but a Sentiment still more dear, and of which I can give no account, makes me dread the moment which is to Separate me from this Sweet friend.
Thou knowest it, faded by misfortune, my heart opened itSelf with difli-culty to friendship : Here it has bestowed itSelf entirely, and my happi-
f
neSs would be compleat, if I could carry her with me to be henceforward my companion. I had even propoSed it to her. Sobs, a civil refufal, her tenderneSs for her father, whom she could not quit, was her anfwer.
y I own it to you, I trusted more
to
L..
( 136 )
to your care. I expected to have found that you loved her; and I flattered mySelf that, deSpising vain prejudices, like me, you could have been happy with her, and have forgot our misfortunes.
Did I deceive myfelf ? or whence comes this change ?”
Thou didst not deceive thySelf;’* replied her brother; and I stiall never change: I adore her, but I cannot be happy. Afk me nothing farther, and fpare the grief of thy brother.”
Henrietta felt her eye-lids wet; a
«
tear efcaped her: She was silent; but it was the silence of timidity and of
grief.
Never was evening more fad than that of this day. Every one devoured his grief; they all shunned one another, and the most tender Sentiments were marked by the deceitful exterior
of
0 »
C 137 )

of infensibility and coldneSs. It was by this means that they tried to perfuade each other they had conquered themSelves.
t
Henrietta alone Sought to banish her habitual grief, to calm that of her friends. Sometimes flie Sought to renew hope in the heart of her brother;
Sometimes her caresses would have revived
\
joy in that of LouiSa, or to quiet old Montane.
The night came at last, this terrible night, which was to decide the liberty of Henrietta and Of Seville.
Their meafures appeared well taken, all had been considered before-hand, and feemed to announce a certain fucceSsj but was it not alfo possible that the following dawn might only difeover their mangled remains ?
Have we not Seen since then the best
. of
f
( Isis )
of Sovereigns, a fugitive in his own dominions, in the midst of his Subjects, the perpetual objects of his Solicitude and affection, stopped by them, loaded with outrage, beholding the threatening poniard turned to his heart; and at length, in defiance both of law and juS-ticc, executed with all the ignominy of the vilest malefactor, and that by thofe very men \vhofe welfare had been the principal study of his whole life.
And thou, courageous Dampierre, to the life of a Sage thou hast added the death of a hero. Thou wast slain in the view of thy King, becauSe thou
hadst not the bafe ferocity to inSult his misfortune. Thy Sovereign wept thy death ; parcion the friend of thy fon, if he ventures alfo to throw one flower upon thy tomb.
Montane concealed thefe frightful apprehensions,
1
( 139 )
prehensions under a Serene countenance; a more painful effort than that even of braving the danger wshich threatened them.
Louifa, loaded still with her fever, only thought on Seville, and on the moment which was going to Separate them ‘for ever.
Seville, in a deep deSpair, implored death in Secret j and when he turned his reflexions on the dangers he was going to encounter, a bitter joy was painted in his face.
Some one enters;—it was Pedrera;— it was midnight, the hour which had been fixed on for their departure. LouiSa, Henrietta, Montane himSelf, feel a chilling coldneSs Slide in their veins; Seville and Pedrera alone remain firm and tranquil. .
Pedrera looks at them a moment in
silence;
(	140 )
silence; he sighs; and addreshng Seville, Take this steel,” faid he to him, behold my pocket-book, in caSe of need it will witneSs for you. I give you . my name, and I shall take your’s. Go, to-morrow I shall fee you at VenaSques.”
Perhaps,” Said Seville, But no matter—give it at any rate: if I do not return thy Sword thou wilt find it in the blood of him who shall have stopped me. Adieu, LouiSa, forget Seville,
%
he will never forget you.”
Then, extinguifliing the Sole lamp which gave light to the apartment, he guides their steps out of the cottage. Pedrera is at his side, as he wished to accompany them as far as his farm. Henrietta and the old Montane followed them trembling. The moon was hid beneath the clouds, and a few straggling
( HI )
I
gling stars afforded a weak and uncertain light.
Seville and Pedrera had hardly passed the threshold of the door; their dazzled eyes could not as yet difeern any object, when, all of a fudden, they feel themSelves Seized by nervous arms, which hold and take their weapons from them.— They were in no condition to make any defence, which would, indeed, have been in vain. The Sword quivers over their heads, and a thouSand Surious voices re-found behind them.
Old Montane drags Henrietta, totter- ] ing, to his daughter, and comes back on the Spot, to preSent himSelf to the strokes, ready to fall on Sevslie. The moon begins to rife from behind the cloud which covers it, and offers the sight, fo many times repeated, of the rage and thirst of blood.
It
m
( 142 )
t	*
It was the troop from St. Licer, guided by Bellifert; it was this monster, who had meditated and conducted vengeance. His fp ies had informed him of the abode of the two strangers at Montane’s, and BelleSert had painted them to the band, as the chieSs of a counter-revolution, which Spain feconded, and of which Pedrera and Montane were themSelves the guilty accomplices.
Inflamed by theSe diScourSes, commanded by a chief from Paris newly arrived among them, under the orders of whom even BelleSert found himfelf; they were come in the night to Surprize the unfortunate Seville.
BelleSert, himSelf, with two of his men, had laid hold of de Valledeuil, whilst Pedrera was in like manner trodden under foot by thefe robbers.
Cries of death were heard on all sides;
This
(	143	)
This was vrhat Bellefert wished for; he looked on the quickest vengeance as the most fure; and he had a strong interest to prevent his victims from being able
to wash themSelves from the crimes of
%
which he had accuSed them.
Seville, cloathed in the habit of the Spaniard, cried out, It is I you must kill; I alone. I am a Frenchman : he is a stranger.
Pedrera, not leSs generous, implored death, and demanded that Seville should be Spared.
Montane, in the midst oS them, raiSed a voice, which could not be heard, and the Same Sate Seemed reServed for him.
BelleSert thought he had already killed Seville ; but his Sword, miSplaced in the confusion, had only wounded him Slightly. One of thofe who were at his side perceived it; he wanted to have theatro-
f
cious
(	144	)
cious advantage of bearing Surer strokes j but, repulSed by thoSe who Surrounded
him, in the moment of striking, his weapon chufes another victim; he thinks he has struck Seville, and it is Bellefert
who vomits his blood and his perfidious foul.
Their chief, milder and more humane than they were, had ordered the victims to be Spared, that they might be judged. His orders had been violated by Bellefert, who existed no longer.
The chief believes still it was Seville who has perished ; he orders them once more to ceafe from slaughter, and Iprings
to the side of Pedrera in order to Save him.
They listen at last to his voice; a moment’s calm enfues, in which they very foon recognise BelleSert extended lifeleSs. They throng round, and endeavour to
help
(	>45	)
help him, during which time the chief
^ \
remains alone with Pedrera and Montane. He was struck with the firm and tranquil air of the one, and the old age of the other.
** Old man,” faid he to Montane " re-• fume your SenSes, and fear nothing, if you are innocent: if you are guilty you owe your blood to your country, wshich you have betrayed.’*
« Young man,’* replied Montane, if the country wants to glut itSelf with the blood of its citizens, lam guilty: I thought to fpare her a crime, in Saving one of her virtuous citizens. Strike! Why waitest thou ? I have only a few days of life left, and of what value is this Small part of my existence ?—I have but one daughter left: thou wilt find her expiring, and thy ferocity will have little trouble in putting an end to her.”
H	ic Old

Old man,” replied the chief, you are unjust towards me :—May you have no other crimes to anfwer for ! Do not confound me with monsters; I ferve my country, but I do not degrade her. Come, re-affure your daughter.”
Then, turning towards his men, I anfwer for this old man,” faid he, *'and perhaps I have Spared you the commission of a crime.”
Louifa, come to her Senfes, after a long fainting fit, darted out of the cottage. Her father w^as in danger; she came to offer herfelf to death for him : O my father, I See you again 1” And, throwing herSelf in his arms, she hung round the old man, who, weakened, let fall fome tears, and groaned out the name of his dear LouiSa.
The chief obferved them in silence:
He even appeared Softened i but, arming
himSelf,
■	(	147	)
himSelf with courage, he quits them, advances towards his troop, calls them together, and commands silence.
Frenchmen,” faid he to them, ” we have been led hither by accounts of warriors and plots. What have we found! An old man, a young Spaniard, terrifiec women. Are thefe exploits worthy o; us? Is this the motive which brings us hither } Let us no longer difgracj our country by ufelefs atrocities, or b} imaginary fears. One of your leader; has lost his life already for having listenec to his credulity, and for having difobeyec my orders. Shall we augment the list o our crimes or our misfortunes} No ; return to St. Licer, and carry off the body of Bellefert. Calm the people’s minds, You, Montbriffon, Auviland, and Gai i-dex, stay with me. You are fufficient to guard an old man, and a young girl. A;
H 2	foon
( )
foon as day shall begin to appear, I will follow you, and we shall lead off the guilty, if there are any here.”
The battalion, confufed, immediately obeyed the orders of their leader j and for the first time they gave an example, sh little followed since then. The country’s guards listened to ^the voice of Subordination.
Meanwhile Pedrera and Seville, had rather been stunned by the robbers than dangerously wounded. SurpriSed without arms, they had been Surious; but it was
at not being in a situation to Sell their lives dearly.
To the inSults with which they were overwhelmed, they had only oppoSed the sirmnefs of a courageous shul, which stands the torrent that outrages it, and knows how to Suffer without complaint.
Under favor of the confusion, of the
noiSe
/
(	149 )
noiSe, and of the darkneSs, they had confounded Pedrera with the old man; and Seville being cloathed like a Spaniard, they believed that effectively there was no
Frenchman of any distincffion in the houSe
• *
of Montane.
The commpder of St. Licer, had perceived this error of his men, and had profited by it, in order to engage them to retire.
That all SuSpicion might be removed, he had kept three of them, of vrhom he was fure. Seville and Pedrera were no longer
o
guarded but by thefe last; the troop was too far removed to be heard, and the chief
4
had entered the cottage with Montane. —---There the most profound ob-
Scurity reigned. Louifa had quitted the arms of her father to throw herSelf into thofe of Henrietta, and both still awaited death.
H 3	Listen,
( HO )
Listen old man,” faid, at last, the chief of the battalion, “ Thou hast not feared death, thou wilt fear to tell a falfehood. Thy Safety, and that of thofe who Surround thee, depends on thy sincerity. I have not a moment to loSe ; an-0
fwer me with truth: Whither wert thou going when I stopped thee ?”
“To VenaSques,” replied Montane; I wanted to conduct this young Frenchman and his sister, who are here, thither, in order to Save them from your hands.”
“ Are they cf the number of thoSe who
#
arc guilty ?”
‘‘ I dare anSvver that they are innocent.’’ And this young Spaniard ?”
“ He vranted to afsist us; it was to his . estate we were to go.”
“ This is Suffleienr, old man S’ Said the chief; “ I believe thee; Obey me in silence, and let nobody hesitate to execute my orders.”	Then,
(	>5‘	)
Then, going out of the cottage, the chief Speaks to the three guards who waited there ; and very Soon the two first vault on their horfes, and ride off with all Speed. Garidex remains alone with Seville and Pedrera.—Young Frenchman,” faid the chief to the fiiss, Take thy sister, and fly with this man, (shewing Garidex) he
will conduct your steps by the past, of Aure. Fear nothing, cither for yourSelves, or for thofe vho remain with me.—And you. Signor, follow them; this evening we will rejoin you at your country-housh, ncarVenafques : but, I repeat it to you, no anfwer: Go; and let not the found of your voice be heard.
Garidex makes Henrietta mount his horfe, Pedrera and Seville are by her side, and all four take the road which conducts to the pafs of Aure. At the fame time the chief of the battalion ordered Montane
H 4	and
C 152 )
and his daughter to follow him; their steps directing themfelves to the left, led them to Venafquct,
They are all ignorant of the motives
which influence the chief who presided
%
over their flight j but his words had reanimated their hopes; they did not take
him for their enemy, but for their assistant and their protector.
“ Louifa, trembling. Supported herSelf with difficulty; she had, nevertheless, reSuSed to mount the horSe of the commandant, and this last had rather choSen to let him run at random at Aranvilie, than to make uSe of him himSelf.
Montane reflected on his destiny, he Saw himSelf obliged, at the end of his days, to quit his hut, to fly into a strange country,
, where, without doubt, want and contempt awaited him, and that without his heart being able to make him the slightest reproach on his conduct.	The
V
( 153 i
The chief himfelsi breaking silence, addressed fome confolatory words to the old
J	'
man, and fustained the tottering steps of
s
LouiSa. After three hours of the miost painful march they arrive at last at the bridge ofTorro where a threatening guard stopped all strangers.
This is the defile of the mountains, and at a little distance, is the territory of Arragon. The chief of St. Licer advanced to the centinel, who stops them j and very Soon Surrounded by the whole detachment, which watches the pafs, he names' himSeff, and makes himSelf known to them; they receive him with reSpect, and very Soon all three paSs without difficulty.
It was five o’clock in the morning, day began to dawn and the bridge of Torro to disappear behind them; but their strength was exhausted. They See at last the column which bounds the frontier of Arra-
H 5	gon:
(	154	)
gon: This view re-animates their courage, l.o' ifa makes a last effort; Montane follows her ; they crofs the barrier; their weary feet refufe to carry them any further, fatigue, obl'ges them to take a repofe, which was indifpensible for them; but the ground they tread on is Spanish ground. They are in Safety, they are free, and henceforward they can look on the distresses of their country like a failor, who, from the top of a rock, fees the ship he has quitted beaten by the tempest, and which the fea is on the point of Swallowing for ever.
The chief, who conducts them, can no longer resist the voice of nature j he falls into the arms of old Montane, and the fweet name of father comes to endear to this old man the forrows with which this night had overwhelmed him; and LouiSa recognizes a brother in her deliverer.
( U5 )
liverer, and the fweet preffures of friend-ship make them very foon forget the outrages they had received from men.
Tears of joy fucceed to the oppreffion of defpair. Old Montane presses his fon to his heart. Louifa bleffed Heaven, which restores her brother to her; ner . dear Adrien, he whofe death she wept every day. ' The young Montane goes from the one to the other. In the intoxication of his joy, his caresses divided, knows not which to addrefs; he wants, in
I
the fame moment, to bestow them on his
*	M	•
father and on his sister. Ah !” faid he to them at last, what violence have I not been forced to ufe with my heart to hinder myfelf from fooner enjoying the happinefs of throwing myfelf in your arms! You recollect, my father, from the moment that I approached you, an inward voice called to me to reSpect you:
H 6	LouiSa
N
( 156 )
Louifa came, you named her; I recognized my father and Sister in the midst of
%
the robbers whom I brought to devour you. Happily I could command myfelf, danger gave me new strength, and I hid my tenderneSs under .the exterior of ferocity. If I had named you, we had ■ been lost ; you and myfelf would have been killed; and they would now have made horrid trophies of our bleeding heads. I appeaSed thefe tigers by feign- . ing to deSpiSe you, and accomplished their difmission.
\
An invented commishon rid me equally of Auvillard and Montbriffon, whom prudence had dictated me to keep. Garidex is my faithful friend ; he will conduct your’s in Security; but it was necessary that we should be dividedj to the end that our number might not cauSe SuSpicion.’* LouiSa, transported with joy, embraced
her
9
{ 157 )
her brother anew,* she owed him more than life, he had Saved her dear Seville. They no longer felt their forrows, their
V
fatigues, nor their hunger; old Montane and LouiSa overwhelmed Adrien with questions; but very Soon this last, helping, them to riSe, exhorted them to continue their road. Henceforward, re-united to you,” faid the young Montane, " I can Satisfy all your questions; but wt are as. yet at too Small a distance from the frontiers : in a few hours our flight will be
dishovered, and a cloud ot madmen will purSue us.’*
Saying theSe words he took LouiSa and his father under the arm, and thoSe roads,. So long painful, were no longer So to them. The vale of VenaSqu^ preSents itSelf at last to their eyes; they difeover the glittering Spires of the town, and an officious Spaniard, to whom they addrefs them-
4	Selves,
( 15* 3
felves, conduas them to the country-houfe of Pedrera, where they announce themfelves as his friends, who came thete to wait for him. The domestics of Pedrera conduct them into a Superb apartment, where they contend who -should
Serve them.
They expected with impatience their friends, conducted by Garidex : and LouiSa sighed often in thinking on the dan-gets which they still encountered. As the road which the young Montane had prescribed for them, was considerably longer, it was hardly possible to fee them before Some time had elapfed. To abridge theSe minutes, which fear prolonged, old Montane recalled to his Son, that they expected from him the story of thofe many years, during which, at a distance from him, they had believed him dead.
‘Vct will obey my father,” faid Adrien,
“ but
(	159 )
but I shall be conciSe. Why fliould I trouble, by bitter recollections, the happinefs I feel in being with you ?”
You remember the time in which they honored my courage, by giving me one of thofe places only destined for thofe who reckon courtiers in their ancestry.— You know that I was a Captain, and that my Colonel conducted me with him to the capital, where I was preSented everywhere, as if the vain title of nobility belonged to me. You even know that I had the misfortune to love; and, above all, to be beloved. Although intoxicated with thefe vain hopes, wshich flatter youth, I was Sensible it was not Sor me to aSpire to one of the first matches in the kingdom.
" She whom I loved, and of whom, doubtleSs,! no longer adore, Save the fpirit, was charming, of an illustrious family ;
and

*
and her foul great, noble, and above prejudice, was worth a thouSand times more all the advantages of fortune united, which she poffeffed., I endeavoured to stifle my inclination, and did not Succeed J I wished to remain silent; my miS-treSs divined my heart, and forced me to explain myfelf. She detested greatneSs, and loved me alone. A thouSand times she proposed to me to carry her off j I aU ways refuSed, and was in the wrong.— The idea of committing a criminal action prevented me. It would have been lawful and virtuous, since it would have faved her: This idea then ought not to
have prevented me.
“ They propoSed another to her, and wanted to force her to accept: She declared to me she would have preferred death, if I would not Save her. I know her; she would have done it as easily as
she
f

r
C ■ i6i )
she threatened me with it. Decided at last to take her off, we agreed on the day and the means. Oh ! my father, I feared to afflict you! I feared your prohibition! Pardon me, therefore, if I did not inform you.
** We were difcovered. I was arrested in the capital as you was this night in your hut} that is to fay, w'ithout the means of death or defence. By the means ^ of a lettre-de-catchet I was conducted Secretly but cloSely guarded acroSs France.
I ashed with entreaty the liberty of informing you of my fate. The brother of
my mistreSs, a Savage, Sole cauSe of my misfortunes, refuSed me this favor, he announced to me that I was dead for you, as well as for the rest of the univerSe, and that you should not be ignorant of it,
“ At the fea-shore, on the coast of Brit-tanny, there rifes, at a little distance from
the
( )
the land, a naked and frightSul rock. A tower, siill more Srightful, has been constructed there, to bury thoSe who have ^ committed the crime oS diSpleastng the great: and it is there I was shut. During the Space oS two years I neither Saw heaven nor earth; an eternal night reigned in my dungeon. I thought here on you, my Sather, on LouiSa, and on my rriiS-treSs; and the most cruel oS my Sorrows W'as the idea oS the grief which my loSs
must occaston you.
►
« One day 1 heard cries of rejoicing, which pierced acroSs the thickneSs of the tower; and till then I had only heard the groans oS deSpair. Attentive to Sounds So new', I listen; they are repeated; my dungeon opens, and they announce liberty to me, telling me that all France enjoys it as I do. I dart out, and prostrate
mySeif beSore the fun, which comes once
more
( i63 )
more to give light to my eyes; We were fifteen victims, delivered from the horrors of flavery. A bark awaits us, and conducts us Speedily to the shore.
“ Shall I go to confole my father, and my Louifa,” faid I to myfelf, when 1 landed ; or shall I go to fee if my mif-
treSs still lives ? But my father, in his
•*
hut, has nothing to fear ; and flie 1 love, is, perhaps, a prey to defpair, or captivity. Perhaps Lean deliver her.
1 was decided and flew to Paris.-----
A new order of things preSents itSelf every where to my view ; but I only beheld my mistreSs, and thought of her alone. I inform myfelf; I fearch; but in vain. She had not been married; and he that they would have compelled her to accept, is, as well as the brother who occasioned my detention, in the number of the nobles who are maffacred.
I fearch
( 164 )
I Search all the neighbourhood, the convents which had been Suppressed, and do not find the object of my Search. Furious, I break looSe against the great, wfio had persecuted me, and I become, in my turn, their most artSent perlecutor. They distinguished my fury, which they named love of the country, and my vengeance was called civifm.
** Behold me chief of a numerous detachment of militia; but, very foon recalled to honor, I faw that, under the name oS love of the country, they concealed the desire of tearing it to pieces ; and that private interest veiled itSelf under the name of public good. I still led my troops, but it was in order to Save thofe victims destined to Slaughter.
Fatigued with my want of power to stop their ferocity, I left Paris, but preferved my rank in the provinces, I came
to
\
«
(	165	)
£0 Bern, to Arramis j I fought you in all the hamlets, built on the shores of the Vert, and I neither found my father nor LouiSa; I could not learn even whither you w'ere retired. I continued my re-Searches, hoping still that all was not lost for me.
** Arrived at St. Licer, they told me the project Sormed against Aranvilie; and they were rejoiced to obtain in me a chief from Paris, to direct their enterprize. Bellefert animated his troops to carnage. I profited by the rank which distin-guished me, and of theif offers to command over him, to be able to Save victims J for I Saw, beforehand, that what was in question was one of thofe vile deceptions with which they terrify and faScinate the eyes of the people, to render them barbarous. My happineSs has Surpassed
(	i6;	)
\
passed my wishes, for I fee you again,
O my Sather, and my dear LouiSa.---------
They are going to consider me as
perjured and a traitor; but it matters little, my heart is pure. Am I guilty to have Saved a virtuous father !
I shall not return to France. What should I do there ? She whom my heart adores exists no longer, without doubt, and henceforward my whole life shall be employed to conSole you for the troubles that the idea of my death have caufed you.—Spain is our reSuge ; it will be our fecond country, more tranquil and more . happy, than that which we have abandoned.
“ Behold, my father, what have been my Sufferings; they still last, they will last always, and never shall the remembrance of her whom they have torn from me leave my heart,	Inform
(	i66 )
" Inform me alfo who is this Frenchman, for whom a generous pity has made you expofe your lives, and this Spaniard, master of this place? Tell me, before they arrive, by what charm the great of Castile, and of our capital, were found
f
under the roof of my father ?”
^ My Son,” replied the old man, a little while ago this Spaniard was unknown to us; a festival drew him to Aranvilie, our country pleafed him, and from that time he Sometimes came to our hamlets. I was afraid that he loved LouiSa; LouiSa, and the noble Sentiments of the Spaniard re-affured me. —As to thofe of France, having attained our valley, in the midst of the dangers which followed them. Seeking to Save themSelves, we received them in our cottage; to have refuSed
them-
(	i68 )
them an entrance was to have assassinated them, in delivering them up to the power of the robbers.
" De Seville is the name of this young man, alas! too amiable. Thy sister, our dear Louifa, idolizes him j and this fatal inclination, created from the moment she Law him, has only gathered new strength from that time.
Do not reproach her; she has struggled, and her painful victory has like to have cost her her life. But, what I can no longer conceal from her is, what she was ignorant of, that he loves her in turn. He offered me to throw his fortune and perSon at her feet. I have re-, jected every thing: I believed thee the
victim of thofe of his rank. Thou wert the most powerful motive of my reSuSal. He will come; thou art alive for my
happinefs}
(	i69	)
happinefs; he shall know it. How can I any longer oppofe his entreaty, and above all, the heart of thy sister ?”
LouiSa, agitated like the leaf by the wind of autumn, which is ready to direct it at pleafure, waited trembling the anSwer of her brother, which was to decide her fate.
Adrien looks at her: he was going to
Ipeak, when Pedrera entered, conducting Seville and Henrietta. They had happily got over the Pafs of Aure, and the Vale of Gistan. Their first duty was to embrace their deliverers. They fall at the feet of the two Montane’s, who raife them in clafping them to their arms.— Henrietta was in thofe of Louifa already, who was happy to fee again her dear Seville.
Henrietta quits Louifa j she desires

Yes,” replied the shepherdefs to her, in conducting her to the two Montanes,
enjoy my happineSs, as I enjoy your .deliverance; felicitate my father; behold my brother, his fon,”
“ His Son ! Your brother !” cries Henrietta, falling again, half dead with fright in the arms of Louifa; ** I thought I Saw
the shade of my dear Adrien, Pardon my delirium, and this moment of involuntary terror.”
Adrien hears this voice; he turns found;/he recognizes Henrietta de Valledeuil, the mistreSs he adores, she who was Horn from him, her whom he thought he had lost for ever ; he precipitates himfelf at her feet, and his behaviour refembles that of his mistrefs.

words, and demanded from both the aS-furance of his happiness.
All hearts were open, mingled ; fear, regret, grief, all thofe evils which make a fport of mankind, have disappeared, and are replaced by joy, the mother and daughter of happinefs.
/
Adrien finds again, in the caresses of
Henrietta, the oblivion of all his Suffer-^ ings ; he still laments, but it is for not having known his dear Valledeuil fooner. It is true he had not been able to See her, in a dark night devoted to carnage:— The Sound oT her voice had not made itSelf be heard, and the name of Seville, of which he was ignorant, had confpired
1 2	to
( 1?2 )
to deceive him y but his heart ought to have gueffecf it.
Henrietta stops the reproaches which he makes to himfelf; already his fadnefs has difappeared, his colour is re-ani-mated, stie dares to tell him she loves, fure ot being alv ays adored.
Seville, quicker than lightning, still at the feet of LouiSa, wants to hear repeated a thouSand times that lie is beloved ; and his tongue is not enough fo exprefs his happineSs.
The old Montane fees his children happy. Yesterday be had only one expiring daughter; to-day he has four children, who all cherith him. His heart opens anew to pleaSure, and he is happy at the happineSs which Surrounds him.
Pedrera himSelf, the generous Pedrera, ’
impofes
( H3 )
impofes silence on his heart; he will be at least the friend of Louifa, and of the fortunate Seville ; his great Soul is Satisfied with this, and he partakes the universal joy.
Night comes to Surprize them in the midst of thefe tranfports ; but how different from the preceding one! Nothing now prevented their wiflies, nothing could trouble their felicity. The next morning was the dawn of a fine day which was to Sliine on the rest of their lives.
The immenSe fortune of Seville, and of Henrietta, might make them live in abundance 5 and Pedrera offered still to share his with them, but they only accepted his friend fliip.
Not stir from Sanagoffaon t he banks of the Ebro, there lies an ancient castle,
